shib holders losing money,"Details from IntoTheBlock reveal that only 33% of total SHIB holders are profitable. Furthermore, 5% of holders are neutral, while 62% of SHIB holders suffer a loss.

However, one positive thing is that 67% of SHIB holders have a long-term investment view, most of which are more than a year. In addition, 30% of holders are holding from one month to 12 months and only 3% of SHIB holders have held for less than a month.

Yes, despite the loss, I still have a lot of faith in this project. What about everyone? Now I will continue to buy more SHIBA and RBIF every quarter. What about everyone's DCA method?

* NOWPayments has been actively supporting SHIB payments over the past several months. The platform has played an important role in the spread of SHIB and the adoption of cryptocurrencies in general.
* With the launch of Shibarium, SHIB will no longer be an ERC-20 token. SHIB will operate within its own blockchain. Maybe NOWPayments will build wallet services and payment gateways for SHIB.
* Recently, the amount of SHIB burned is also expected to increase significantly after the mainnet goes live.

gary gensler sec decides token attack next security,"Ever had the feeling that the SEC randomly chooses which cryptocurrency to attack for ""being a security""? To quote the wise Heisenberg: You're god damn right.

Actually, I'll give you some insider knowledge because my father is a professor at MIT: Gary Gensler use the famous pop bubble strategy. Whichever cryptocurrency he pops is alleged to be a security.

So this is your opportunity to find out which cryptocurrency will be coined a security next. Pop away and be prepared to sell if you are an unfortunate holder.

alt coins showing early signs might popular next bull market ones gon na struggle ones gon na make big come back ones tumble look keep eye alt market wakes slumber,"# Intro:

These aren't my favorite coins, nor the best coins, nor all my holdings (see disclosure at the bottom). 

They are the alt coins I can see the market jumping on, sometimes for all the wrong reasons.

I don't have a crystal ball, but I have been in this market for many years and many cycles. And I'm starting to get an idea of what the market likes to jump on, what mistakes it likes to repeat, and type of coins attract hype. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What I think the popular alt coins under BTC, ETH, and USDT will be in the next bull run:

To preface, frankly I was disappointed by this list.

There's only 1 coin I really like on this list. But I objectively went with what I think OTHER PEOPLE would eat up. And yes, people don't always make the best choices.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.Matic** 40% sure

This is probably my boldest prediction. I can see this one being the most shilled alt coin. That's because most people will be coming from a stash of either Bitcoin or Ethereum, or both, before jumping on alts. And coming a little more from Ethereum, I can see them going for Matic. 

**2- XRP** 50% sure

All the negative things about centralization seem to have  been forgotten. It's starting to look like XRP is portrayed as the hero coin fighting the SEC. 

**3- Doge** 70% sure

Don't expect that people will have learned anything about the big pump and dump, and the hype. And don't expect that they will turn to other meme coins instead. Doge is the established meme coin. 

**4- ATOM** 65% sure

This one is gonna be easy to shill for those shilling the tech side. There's too many positives and good numbers. And there's a reason why it's already showing signs of being the sub's darling for the next bull market. It has quickly moved up in the top mentioned coin on here. But watch out, it means it will also eventually tumble hard, if inverse r/cc still holds true. 

**5- ADA** 55% sure

The ""scientific"" blockchain will strike again with a new generation of crypto nerds. Every cycle Cardano gets ruled out, and every cycle it keeps coming back strong. And for some reason, the bull market has a boner for this coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Other top coins: BNB, Polkadot, Link, Avax, Algo, Shib, FTM, AAVE, Vet, GRT, Uni. People are gonna eat those up again, despite some of them having some shortcomings.

Also, each cycle the alt landscape changes less and less. So we're not gonna see that big of a dramatic change in popular coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Biggest surprises, that will do well:

Alt coins that will surprisingly be strong:

**1- SOL**

At this point, it doesn't seem like the market cares about a coin being down or being shut down. Just look at ETC who got 51% attacks multiple times, and keeps coming back in the top 50. A new batch of people will jump in and go ""but it's so fast"". So don't be surprised if SOL has a strong bull market, despite its shortcomings. 

**2- Casper Labs**

I think this will be one of those new hot coins full of powerful tech, like Harmony was in the last cycle. Hopefully without the bridge hack.

**3- Moons**

Not to shill Moons, but objectively, bull markets helped boost Moons in the past from $0.009 to over $0.40, thanks to increased activity. And this time around, Moons will have mainnet, much more utility, and could draw more hype from outside Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Coins that will remain too underrated.

**1- Monero**

Monero has gotta to be the most underrated crypto of all cycles. And I think this next bull market won't be that much diffferent.

**2- LTC**

Despite a high market cap right now, I think it will be overtaken by several coins, and not receive that much hype.

**3- XLM**

I think it will be overshadowed by XRP. Despite being one of the most useful for transactions. It won't get much hype.

&amp;#x200B;

# The comeback kids. Coins that will make the biggest comeback.

**1-Nano**

Just from already a few shill posts about Nano, I can already see some foreshadowing, a return of the annoying Nano shills, and this one making a big come back. There is already the same narrative ""why is a coin that's so fast and with no fees, not a top 10 coin?"". Don't bother explaining it, they will still buy it.

**2- LRC**

Same thing. I think the shills and the hype never truly died, they just went into hibernation.

**3- Harmony**

This is another bold prediction. A new generation will come in and just see the really impressive tech side, and impressive numbers for TPS, finality, low fees, and see the big potential in their smart contracts. And when we'll try to explain to them the bridge hack, they'll just go ""that's it?"". However, there will need to be some revival on the team side for that to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Coins that might tumble and crumble.

**1- Tron**

This is a risky prediction. People could eat up Tron, and it's managed to do well despite all its issues. But I'm gonna wager Tron will finally tumble like BSV.

**2- SNX**

This one could potentially explode and do really well. But because of the regulatory climate right now, I would lean more on SNX facing some real danger from regulation.

**3- \[Insert the next coin that will pull an FTT, CEL, LUNA, etc\]**

There's already several potential candidates, and I don't know which one to chose. But I'm willing to bet we'll see history repeat itself again, and many people who didn't learn their lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

# How biased I am:

Here are my holdings for full disclosure:

My 3 main and large holdings are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Moons.

My small bags, but still significant enough: ATOM, LINK, XMR, XLM.

And then I hold a really small amount of over a dozen more alt coins.",1,0,2023-04-19 13:05:37,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
moonshot smallcap coin price analysis based market cap multiples,"Today, I encountered a very interesting post about PEPE coin - a new coin that emerged a few days ago.

Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe\_mooning\_meme\_coins\_exceed\_caution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe_mooning_meme_coins_exceed_caution/)

Many people caught it early and made a multiple of their money.

In this post, I'll try to explain why you're most probably too late to do a 100000% return on it.

# Let's do some maths

The current market cap of PEPE is $100m as per: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/)

How much of a multiple can we expect?

Well, the largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $11b. I'll round it down to $10b.

So:

* If PEPE overtakes DOGE, it will do ""just"" a 100x. 
* If PEPE overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If PEPE reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, is it worth it to throw $100 right now? Maybe it's a bit late - it's highly unlikely that it will overtake DOGE, and even if it did, you'll have $10k - not nearly enough even for a lambo, not to even speak about retiring early. 

On the other hand, I think it's realistic for PEPE to reach $200m or $300m market cap, which will 2-3x your money.

If you want to gamble, be my guest.

But you're not retiring from this. 

Exercise caution and be careful. Once a coin is mentioned on this sub, it's already too late.

kitty meme coin,"  

The cryptocurrency industry has been a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. However, a new player has entered the game: meme coins. And one meme coin, in particular, is making headlines ‚Äì Kitty Meme Coin.

Kitty Meme Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the popular internet meme of cats. The coin has been gaining popularity in recent months, with many investors seeing it as a potential new player in the cryptocurrency industry. Some have even gone so far as to predict that Kitty Meme Coin is going to win the meme coin industry.

So why has Kitty Coin been gaining so much attention? One reason is its unique branding. The coin is marketed as a fun, lighthearted cryptocurrency that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. This approach has resonated with many investors, who are drawn to the idea of a cryptocurrency that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Another reason for Kitty Meme Coin's popularity is its strong community. The coin has a dedicated group of supporters who are passionate about its success. This community has helped to spread the word about Kitty Coin and has even developed its own online forums and social media channels.

But can Kitty Coin really win the meme coin industry? That remains to be seen. While the coin has gained a lot of attention in recent months, it is still a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency world. It will need to continue to attract new investors and build a strong community if it hopes to compete with established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency industry is notoriously volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. While Kitty Coin has seen strong growth in recent months, there is no guarantee that this will continue.

Overall, it is clear that Kitty Coin has captured the attention of many investors and has the potential to be a major player in the meme coin industry. However, only time will tell whether it can sustain its momentum and truly come out on top.",1,0,2023-04-20 09:20:56,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

decoding crypto memes tale two coins,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the depths of the cryptocurrency meme culture, exploring the enigmatic world of two particular coins that have captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Hold onto your private keys, because this post is about to get wild!

In the red corner, we have the reigning meme champ, Dogecoin ($DOGE). Spawned from the legendary Shiba Inu meme, Dogecoin initially started as a joke in 2013, but has since become a formidable force in the crypto world. With a thriving community and Elon Musk as its unofficial mascot, Dogecoin has reached heights that would leave its creators in awe.

In the blue corner, we have a newcomer to the crypto-meme world, Garlicoin ($GRLC). Launched in 2018, Garlicoin was inspired by the garlic bread meme that took the internet by storm. Created as a parody, Garlicoin has since built a dedicated community of followers, all sharing a passion for cryptocurrency and a love for garlicky goodness.

As these two meme-laden cryptocurrencies battle for supremacy, their respective communities have been engaging in friendly banter and creative content, both online and offline. From Dogecoin-inspired graffiti to Garlicoin's garlic bread giveaways, these two coins have brought joy and laughter to many in the world of cryptocurrency.

Despite their memetic origins, both Dogecoin and Garlicoin have inspired real-world projects and charitable initiatives. Dogecoin has funded NASCAR sponsorships, Jamaican bobsled teams, and even water wells in Kenya. Meanwhile, Garlicoin's community has engaged in philanthropic efforts, such as disaster relief fundraising and combating food insecurity.

As we witness the ongoing duel between these two meme coins, we can't help but appreciate the levity and humor they bring to the often-serious world of cryptocurrency. So, whether you're a die-hard Dogecoin hodler or a Garlicoin connoisseur, remember that, in the end, we're all part of a larger community that shares a passion for decentralized finance and technological innovation.

And now, for the quote that will have you questioning everything you've just read:

""Why did the cryptocurrency cross the blockchain? To get to the other side...of the meme economy. But seriously, which coin would win in a dance-off: Dogecoin or Garlicoin?""",2,15,2023-04-20 20:48:55,,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY
crypto phases wish skipped,"We‚Äôve all had our low points, and crypto is no exception. I'd like to share some of the different phases I went through in crypto, all of which I wish I never went through. Hopefully this will save some of you from wasting your time and money like I did...

&amp;#x200B;

Trading on the Crypto dot com app

As most of you know, the CDC app has high fees, and high spreads. If you must, use their exchange (unless you are in the US) The app has a nice UI that works (kinda) well, and is best suited for brand new investors. Frequent buys and sells in app will result in losses that would have been easily preventable. 

* **Full-porting into dog tokens**

If you say you've never bought Doge or SHIB, you're a liar. I for one have bought them, and at one time had most of my portfolio sunk into them. We all already know how this turned out. Meme tokens are fun, and if you want to hold them, do so sparingly. 

* **Not understanding Market Cap**

This one goes along with the bullet above. The appeal to most shitcoins is the extremely low price, which tricks new investors thinking they have gotten in at ""such a low price!"" I bought a few million SHIB a few years back thinking it could reach the price of Bitcoin, oh how wrong I was. 

* **Neglecting blue chips (BTC and ETH)**

Pretty self explanatory. Sure, alts may make you more money, or may not...

* **Too frequently sending your money off the exchange**

This one is for my broke boys out there. When I started investing in crypto, I never had much, and gas fees were noticeable to my holdings. I'd send my crypto off each time I bought, dwindling my holdings little by little. I will never preach keeping your money on the exchanges, but you also don't need to send it off each time you buy. So unless you buy thousands at a time, maybe consider keeping your money on the exchange for a couple weeks, and send 7-21 days worth of buys to save on gas. It sure would have saved me some money. 

* **Keeping your money on the exchange**

I am well aware this appears to contradict the above point, but what I meant by this one is having the exchange hold your money forever. When you buy on the exchange, the money is never really *yours.* You are essentially given a carnival ticket that says the exchange *owes* you the money whenever you'd like to withdraw. The money is **never** yours until it is back in your bank account *(up for debate after SVB*), or withdrawn to your personal crypto wallet. I have never personally been effected by and exchange collapse, and I don't plan to. This is the only way to ensure you have control over your crypto. 

* **Having high expectations for returns**

Expecting insane returns on your investments will leave you waiting for a day that may never come. You won't ever take profits, and will be left holding the bag. *I'm looking at you CRO.* Setting realistic expectations will help you take profits when the time comes. 

* **Staring at the charts all day**

I can almost guarantee nothing will happen if you step away for a few hours, or even days. Rest those eyes, get some sleep. Everything will be okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

There you have it. I am in no way a Crypto vet, but man I have done some dumb shit. Feel free to learn from my mistakes, and maybe share your own regrets if you so choose.",14,74,2023-04-21 02:17:40,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL

lets talk memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. 

Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

So let‚Äôs talk about **Doge V Shiba Inu**

*Utility*
Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. 

Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. 

Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. 

**On-Chain Data**

Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. 

Doge‚Äôs active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. 

This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. 


While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba‚Äôs price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

anybody else hate shitcoins cryptos reputation,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections.

I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated.

I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space.

I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

funny could worth,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future.

I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho  but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm.

These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. 

Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget. 

Is any of this project worth investing cos I guess Shiba Inu and Doge seem to start in this similar fashion some of didn't take it seriously",2,72,2023-04-23 23:30:33,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

market cap use analysis explained nbs,"In summary, **market cap** is the product of the **price** and the **circulating supply** of a coin.

In other words, it's a measure that shows how large a project is.

It's not a specific term for crypto and it's commonly used in traditional markets as well, such as stocks. Let's use a hypothetical company X for example:

* The price per share is $5
* There are 1,000,000 shares outstanding
* The market cap is the price \* the shares = $5M

# Finding the Market Caps for Coins

The best places to find the market capitalizations (market caps in short) for crypto projects are:

1. CoinMarketCap
2. CoinGecko

Just type in your project of choice and take a look.

Here's an example for Bitcoin:

https://preview.redd.it/yp7g2vl3m1wa1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ef05af954c30b4b2acea8a039a4ad343dbabf40

As you can see above the chart, there are the relevant fields:

* **The market cap -** how big is the project currently, expressed in USD
* **The ""fully diluted"" market cap -** how big would the project be if all units are in circulation (remember, there is still Bitcoin that will be mined, so we don't count those in the market cap)
* **Volume -** how much BTC was traded in the last 24h, expressed in USD
* **Circulating supply -** how many BTC are in circulation at this particular moment. As you can see, currently we have 19,355,918BTC out of the 21M that will ever exist.

The **market cap** is the reason why Bitcoin is #1 largest project.

Not the price.

You can find the same information for stocks on Yahoo Finance.

# A Common Misconception (You Probably Have)

A common bad habit many people have is looking only at the price.

I'm referring to thinking that a coin can 1000x because its price is under $1.

**This is incorrect.**

To see the potential of a coin, you have to look at the **price**, but also at the **market cap** and the **circulating supply**.

Many already understand why, but I'll give an example.

# Analysis of a Hypothetical Coin: X INU

Let's say there's a new meme coin called **X INU**. Its current price is $0.001.

Before going all in thinking *""If it hits just $1, I'll make a 1000x!!1""*, check whether it's possible for it to do such a multiple.

You take a look at the market cap, and you see that it's **$100M** (i.e. there are 100,000,000,000 tokens in circulation).

Now, what's the possibility of **X INU** doing a 1000x? Well, that would mean that the market cap would become **$100B**.

Is it realistic to expect that the market will value a meme coin at 100 billion dollars?

Let's check what the market says:

# Comparing to Market Caps of Similar Projects

We know that **X INU** has a market cap of $100M.

The largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $10B, rounded down.

So:

* If X INU overtakes DOGE, it will do a 100x.
* If X INU overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If X INU reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, in the highly unlikely scenario that this new meme coin jumps to one of the top positions per market cap, it will be **just a 100x**.

And I'm saying ""just"" because the n00bs' dreams of retiring after throwing their life savings of $17 in a meme coin disappear after reading this.

Basically, if you see that a coin already has a $100M market cap, you might expect a 2-3x if the conditions are great, but you're not even getting a lambo nor retiring early with such a project.

# TLDR

**A $100M market cap meme coin won't do a 1000x.**

If it were to, we would see it right next to DOGE, among these titans:

floki inus listing skyrockets price,"
After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048.


The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday.

The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm.

Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings.

FLOKI‚Äôs listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US‚Äô large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project‚Äôs next goal.
After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project‚Äôs team and backers. The coin‚Äôs market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

I'm definitely in because for some time I've been considering buying land with Windfall tokens, so this could be a nice opportunity.  


But I noticed that the Metaverse Shibas Inu team has not disclosed further details about the contest.   


Does anyone know the details?  


I only find out that the SHIB metaverse will feature 100,595 plots of land that will be mintable by users. Landowners can generate passive income from their fields, collect in-game resources, and generate rewards.  


What do you think about this type of giveaway?",20,1,2023-04-26 09:43:56,,Shibarmy,Discussion

portfolio input,"
Looking for some honest feedback and/or criticism on my portfolio. No pissing match here, just want to make sure I‚Äôm setup for success over the next 2 years. I don‚Äôt have false hopes of being a multimillionaire overnight, but I want to capitalize the next bullrun as much as possible. Nobody knows me here so I don‚Äôt care about sharing rough figures. Right now I have roughly 55k invested. Also full disclosure, my figures below won‚Äôt represent what I currently have locked in Celsius due to chapter 11. Not sure how much of that I‚Äôll get back, but hopefully a decent amount once that nightmare wraps up.  Out of the coins I have full access to at the moment this is the rough breakdown:
BTC: 62%
DOT: 12%
LINK: 8%
VET: 4%
AUDIO: 3%
NEAR, HBAR, SAND, DAI: each ~2%
DOGE, SHIB, FIL: each ~1%

Locked on Celsius I have another .25 btc, about 8 ETH, and a good amount of stables I intended to buy the bottom of the market with (thanks a lot Mashinsky). Obviously if I added that to my available portfolio, the percentages of everything will be adjusted. As of right now, I‚Äôm considering it a loss until we are out of ch.11.

Every month from now until the halving I plan to add an extra 1-2k to continue to DCA. Once the halving hits I‚Äôll likely sit on my hands for a year. With that additional money I plan to purchase new coins as well as strengthen my positions in some of the lower cap coins on my list. Coins I plan to add are: THETA, XRP, ADA, FET, MATIC, SOL, QNT, BAND. I‚Äôd like to knock my btc exposure down to 40-50% by time I‚Äôm done.

I know my portfolio is not loaded with coins that have 50 X potential. I‚Äôm looking for growth, but I‚Äôm also looking for safety. I don‚Äôt really want shit coins that have tremendous risk (I understand risk is relative in this sector). I don‚Äôt mind throwing a grand or two in something as a YOLO play, but I want majority of my pics to be blue chip, or at least in the top 25 or so coins. Im a big fan of passive income so I love stakable coins. That‚Äôs essentially the reason DOT is currently my #2 holding. 

I‚Äôm not going to fall for your scams, so don‚Äôt bother messaging me. I won‚Äôt reply to private messages.
Thanks in advance for any input",1,0,2023-04-26 16:12:14,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

arent enough help promote moons communityand change,"Now we all know how much hype is important for the growth of a crypto project, and yet all we do here is shill them to ourselves, creating a big echo chamber while making it unlikely for the entire internet to hear about our token.

I think one of the strongest points about our token is the size of the community, but unlike other shitcoin communities, we don't really spread the word about ours anywhere we go.

For example, I have seen some of my irl friends have doge as their profile pic on facebook, I've personally worked as a writer for a community shiba inu website where they try to promote shib for the internet, and so on and so forth..

Also, I saw many people on reddit recruiting meme posters on 4chan about crypto projects, and some even  recruit ""guerilla marketers"" , who try and push certain coins without making it obvious in crypto subs like this one. The thing is , we can do all this to help push our token and grow its adoption. 

Try to mention moons on crypto twitter like all shitcoin degens do. If you're a 4chan user let them know about your x10 play (moons). It isn't really unethical because I'm pretty sure moons are more of a solid investment han the DogeElonCum kind of tokens shilled around there.

 That way we can have a domino effect and have the media covering us ,more people buying our token, and eventually more cex listings and positive price action. Let me know what do you think about this strategy, and how we can help spread the word about moons in the future.",1,0,2023-04-26 22:58:15,,CryptoCurrency,MOONS üåï
want sound logical reasonable technical factually backed bitcoin fud look,"It's hard to find it here cuz most have made up their minds for/against Bitcoin already, and the majority of posts lately are Marco reposts or comedy flairs for the moon farmer's market stand.

The Bitcoin sub is too bullishly cracked on memes and the Buttcoin sub is an echo chamber of ragers who missed the bottom.

I don't want philosophical or moral or conceptual or dollar to zero stuff. I want to know the technical limitations Bitcoin currently has in achieving what all the bulls say it will someday achieve.

Some examples of what I want to dive more into:

Bear : tps too low
Bull: lightning network
Bear: opening/maintaining channels is weird/difficult because of xyz

Bear: halvings eventually won't reward miners
Bull: fees will generate mining revenue 
Bear: exorbitant fees on a deflationary asset will further discourage transactions volume and monetary velocity meaning less revenue to secure the pow network and perhaps less economic gdp.

Bear: privacy?
Bull: mixers and utxo w/ diff addresses
Bear: govs eventually sanctioning protocols potentially used for tax evasion or money laundering which may lead to cutting off fiat on-ramps for wallet addresses that have interacted with such protocols.

It's my understanding that Bitcoin set out to replace fiat currency and become the ultimate store of value. If it can't outdo the current tps for the modern digital economy, can't maintain a stable store of value with its speculative volatility, and may or may not have its security compromised with the lack of capitalist incentives in a non decentralized mining environment down the road (like 1-4 major miners cherry picking what makes it into each block), how will it ever achieve anything more than it already has? Will it forever be an open infrastructure with a hodl strategy peddled by speculative and euphoric OGs, shills, and cultists? 

I like the idea of Bitcoin as well as the philosophy behind it, but there's a long road between 1BTC = $X? and 1BTC=1BTC and I don't yet know enough to not talk out of my a$$ so I want to know what technical arguments may be holding it back and could forever keep it in the speculative, quasi religious sector of the crypto asset class. 

Even tho the idea of a decentralized, unhackable network providing a medium of exchange for value transfer sounds and is amazing, I'm not quite sold that Bitcoin, being the first answer, is the final and best answer. Bitcoiners like to think they picked the next world reserve currency but doge coin, shib, and xmr folks think that too which is why I've been leaning away from crypto as a CURRENCY and have been focusing on token projects providing infrastructure, utility and interoperability with today's economy.

Anywho it would be great if someone could plz point me to the ultimate Bitcoin fud post/comment/subreddit so I can weigh the bull case against an educated bear case.

Now this is all in light hearted fun folks.  I like both fiat and crypto.  But what happens if the internet goes down?  What happens if a country's bitcoin mining facilities get blown up during a war?  What if I can't access my Doge???

Now I'm not saying banks are going to screw us over anyway lol what I'm saying is: at least for now, if the internet went down, I could go and withdraw fiat money.  Or, if you're a silly goose like me and hide cash underneath the uh....I mean.....nevermind.....

This is of course an open discussion.  I would love more insight from those of you who actually know what you're talking about.

Also I want to recognize how crypto is definitely worth it in the long run for stability, transferring funds super quick, etc.  Not trying to shill out in crypto.  Just sparking some discussion.

want start investing something completely lost crypto world since first months dont know lot new projects invest something need recommendations,"Hi guys, I am not in the crypto world since the quoted date and I have some incomes periodically per month during a year, and sometimes I think about invest something again, maybe 50‚Ç¨ first, and if I have good results another 50‚Ç¨ in another month and of that way for a time. But I'm really lost today and don't know where to go and take risks, I don't know about the potential options nowadays to can make some good profits. I have something which isn't so much in a familiar account, and a bit quantity in personal wallet, most of it is Ethereum.

I invested at the time on KILT due recommendations of a friend who have more knowledges than me about this, and which the project seemed promiseful to me, and due the analysis technical in their moment he did and recommended me buy so much as I can, he knows better how it works and he haves a huge of quantity on KILT, 2000-3000‚Ç¨ (I studied about crypto and technical analysys and trading a bit, but a lot of time ago and I barely remembers how to read good the graphics and understand their behaviour on a concrete way to can take decissions before invest). I need to see that book again was some helpful, but I don't know so much about the different indicators which could show the probabilities of that a coin could rise their price. I remember some things for example *(please correct me if I'm mistaken)* that if the circulant supply is really high, of 300 millions or more for example, would be barely impossible which the price one day get a good value, unless they burn periocally a lot of tokens, or similar, the company behind the project. 

I also have some of LTC, KDA (a hard hit, 84% in losses), ATOM, XHV, and a bit of SHIB and ADA. 

Which coins do you think which have potential and can recommend me? If you could invest 30-50‚Ç¨ per month, or maybe some more, which cryptos would you buy and why?

potential prices moons could reach,"Have you ever wondered if Moons could moon? 

Well, it's possible and very likely to happen! Moons have a low market cap, which means that they still have a lot of space to grow even more!  
Here are the prices moons could reach if they had the same market cap as other big cryptocurrencies:

# MONERO:

If moons had the same market cap as monero, they would be worth around **$26.40**! That's a **118x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# SHIB:

If moons had the same market cap as shib, they would be worth around **$56.72**! That's a **256x** increase in its price!

&amp;#x200B;

# SOLANA: 

If moons had the same market cap as SOL, they would be worth **$84.36**! That would be a **381x** price increase for moons!

&amp;#x200B;

# DOGECOIN:

If moons had the same market cap as DOGE, they would be worth approximately **$104.45**! That is a **472x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

Before heading to the top 3 market caps (excluding stable coins), here are some honorable mentions:

**Avalanche: $53.56**

**Litecoin: $60.91**

**Matic: $86.30**

**Cardano: $132.56**

**XRP: $228.79**

The honorable mentions list is over, now let's head to the top 3!

&amp;#x200B;

# BNB:

If Moons had the same market cap as BNB, they would be worth an amazing **$477.24!** That would be a 2158x price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# ETHEREUM:

If Moons had the same market cap as ETH, they would be worth a spectacular **$2,134.43**! That's a HUGE price increase, giving Moons a **9655x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# BITCOIN:

And we've finally reached the biggest crypto ever: Bitcoin. It has a huge market cap, which would bring the moons price to an incredible **24003x** price increase, making them worth **$5,306.05!**",1,0,2023-04-28 17:50:49,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

recent fud around shibarium,"ALL - the recent FUD around Shibarium is coming from the old discord channel so i want to make some things clear to people

THE FUD

1. The old discord owners are the defense team only and they are salty because shytoshi decided to remove some people. They have no power in any development.

2. Some of the mods and others werent selected for certain roles (validators, development, design, marketing and others). Shytoshi selected his own team.

3. They decided to FUD the project and create / promote some shitcoin scam.

THE TRUTH 

1. There was a new discord created called shibariumtech. (Get link from official sources)Ran BY developers and shytoshi. Much more reliable info here and less toxic


2. We have 1000s of projects waiting to come to use shibarium upon launch of mainnet in hopefully 2-6 months.

3. We have many great things being built (metaverse, NFTs, shibaswap V2, cold wallets and much more)

4. The FUTURE is bright and shib army will prevail don‚Äôt listen to the FUUDDERS!

newcomers top cryptocurrencies short explanation,"I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) post of 2 years ago and thought it would be interesting to update this for the situation today.

After 2 years, 66% of the currencies in the list are still there. Somtimes in a different order of course. I believe this is quite a lot in a volatile market as crypto with many scams going around.

&amp;#x200B;

* Obvious disappearances from the list include: Terra (LUNA), FTX Token (FTT) and Celsius (CEL).
* Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC).
* The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving.  


As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment!  


&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin (BTC):¬†the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ‚Äúonline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.‚Äù
2. Ethereum (ETH):¬†Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. Tether (USDT):¬†a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now‚Ä¶
4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
5. USD Coin (USDC):¬†another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
6. Ripple (XRP):¬†centralized coin, most people don‚Äôt see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. Cardano (ADA):¬†another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
8. Dogecoin (DOGE):¬†Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon!
9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues.

- Vitalik is one of the co-founders of SHIB

- Satoshi Nakamoto is Hal Finney

- Tether is controlled by the CIA

- Satoshi's dormant wallet is held by the Illuminati

community memeshitcoins cults damaging mental health,"Meme/shitcoin communities are cults and damaging to peoples mental health, yeah its true‚Ä¶ especially to the mental health of youth. 

As funny as it may sound it‚Äôs actually true, we live in a economy where it might be uncertain whether or not you will even be able to buy or rent a house/apartment some day. People will look at anything that can potentially make them money and fomo in.

There are so many shitcoin projects and ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù projects getting major exposure on social media as well as general media. This gets young people not understanding the risks of investment in these coins to invest mayor funds. You can call them dumb, but really is it their fault when they are so so desperate to make some money to make it in life?

As media will say 1000x in just a week! People will fomo in and be basically held hostage by the so called ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù and gas fees and those bs ‚Äútokenomics‚Äù. Saying don‚Äôt fear just Hodl. Really? Hodl what? A token with literally 0 utility? The same thing is any other ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù token? 

The ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù of these tokens are so deep into this whole scheme that they will say anything is fud even if it is the truth. And will say just hodl! Whilst watching their money go down the drain. 

These coins are literally all designed to lure people in and keep them captive, no rugpull needed. Focus and invest in real projects and other blockchains, not shit meme tokens that wont make you any money. 

It is literally insane to me thet shiba inu is number 15 on cmc based on market cap. A litteral shitcoin with no functionality what so ever. Safemoon, dogecoin, really?

careful meme coin season fomo,"It's back! No not the bull market, not defi summer, not alt coin season, its not even nft's are back season. Its simply good old meme aka shit coin season. It is back and in full force and you degens better be prepared to not be sucked in to dumb coins that are most likely going to leave you with empty bags. 

Sadly this is a reality for so many. We all remember during the good ol covid days how the beloved squid games token was born, one day went up and the next day went down like a bag of bricks. Well that is exactly what is going to happen to many people with this new overly hyped up ""meme coin season"" Truth is there have been very few meme coins that have with stood the test of time with shiba inu being one of them. For some reason some how when doggy token craze was in full effect shiba inu who was born with 10 zeroes managed to knock of 6 zeroes making a lot of people a lot of money. That was once in a blue moon scenario. Are we going through another blue moon phase? Maybe. But all that would mean is that of the 25-50 meme coins released over the past 2 weeks maybe and only maybe one will be around a year or 2 from now in the top 25, 50 or even top 100 by market cap.

It is very difficult for these ""projects"" and I use the word projects loosely to be successful over time. It takes a lot of hype from a community to stir up the pot enough to get millions of users to buy in and fomo. 

All I am saying is be smart and be cautious. A lot of these meme coins have unknown devs. These tokens / contracts / websites can be made in a matter of an hour by someone no one knows nothing about who could be anywhere in the world. The fear of empty bags is one thing. The fear of malicious contract interaction draining your wallet to zero should terrify you. 

I am not going to mention any of the recently born meme coins. If you want in and want to play the high risk high reward game that is up to you. My duty here is to remind you all that 99% of all who buy these specially in a bear market end up rekt. Don't be that person.",12,92,2023-04-29 22:40:39,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

keep dream alive hodl," Hi Shib Soldiers!!

Happy to Introduce the ""Double it and give it to the next person"" NFT collection featuring 68 unique Shiba illustrations combined in 17 Lambo Woofs. As part of the highly anticipated Shibarium launch, this exclusive collection is dropping for us loyal diamond hands holders who have never given up on Shiba. 

I am by far **not** a pro-NFT dude, this is my first time doing it. I was missing the thrill of the ATH periods and the excitement was slowing coming back with the soon Shibarium launch, which is why I wanted to give something back to this amazing (something a bit ambitious) community :D 

50% of the profits from each NFT sale will be reinvested in Shiba that is burned, helping to increase its value and benefit the ShibArmy. Additionally, 30% of the profits will be donated to the National Shiba Inu Rescue, a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing and finding homes for Shiba Inus in need.

Website where amount of burned and donated will be available soon with proof! If you guys have any suggestions on that, please enlighten me. 

""Double it and give it to the next person"" is the perfect addition to your NFT collection, whether you want to follow the viral trend and double your investment, or simply join us on this exciting journey and donate to help our favorite dog breed.

Rare collectables coming soon!

Join us and let's make the ShibArmy stronger together! Keep the dream alive &amp; lets get rich!!

shibarium bridge allow partnerships tokens,"Hey everyone. Out of curiosity have we heard anything about SHIBRANIUM and the SHIBASWAP site allowing a bridge to other networks other than ETH?

  
There are a few ecosystems that are doing some rather similar work from teams that would probably benefit from some SHIB exposure.

  
SWEEP and BABYSWEEP on BSChain for example would be a killer partnership with SHIB. Staking on SHIBASWAP and viceversa on their https://www.sweepproject.com portal. They're doing NFT auctions, staking and the like and I imagine it would be a pretty killer team up.

thoughts keeping meme coins exchanges,"So lately we have all seen how important is to have coins in self custody. And I agree with that.

But I did notice something. 2 times so far when Elon did something connecting Twitter and Dogecoin, DOGE pumped. And I had my DOGE in a hardware wallet tucked away somewhere inconvenient so I prevent myself from impulse selling stuff. I could sell at the spike, there was quite a low chance that the price will remain there. But it would take some time to get my Ledger and send it to exchange and sell it.

So I didn't do it because I am a miserable hodler (with the exception mentioned in my other post).

I realised something. If you own a memecoin, it might be actually smart to keep memecoins such as SHIB and DOGE on exchange in order to react to those ridiculus spikes. At least to take advantage, sell and maybe later buy more at lower price, ergo accumulating said coin.

So you wanna say: ""What if the exchange goes to shit and I lose my funds?""

First of all: You have to be a special degenerate and gambler to have a high percentage of your portfolio in memecoins.

Second: If you do have a large amount in meme coins, that would mostly mean you also have a lot of money already to be playing around with it like that so I guess a potential loss like that wouldnt change your life for the worse.l

So tell me if I missed something important here?",14,86,2023-04-30 15:40:13,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

massive trillion shiba inu shib buying frenzy good true,"Large crypto market participants have purchased over 6.4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens in the past week, according to crypto intelligence portal IntoTheBlock. The most active day of the week was Wednesday, with 1.39 trillion SHIB tokens bought. 

There are currently 124 big buyers' addresses in Shiba Inu, which includes those addresses that traded at least 1% of the token's total trading volume. However, there seems to be a catch as the number of SHIB sold by big players is believed to be 6.5 trillion tokens, which is 100 billion more than what was purchased. 

Additionally, the number of addresses of such big sellers is 149. This suggests that there may be some uncertainty and volatility around the Shiba Inu token. 

Although bears outperformed bulls by 100 billion SHIB tokens, it did not significantly affect the token price, indicating the turbulence in the week for Shiba Inu and the entire crypto market. 

Throughout the week, the trading initiative shifted multiple times from sellers to buyers and vice versa, making it a rollercoaster ride.",20,4,2023-05-01 11:52:23,,Shibarmy,

Youll see people with 8 figure net worth posting about anime and frog pictures saying ‚Äú4‚Äù ad nauseam engaging with all sorts of people, sharing their disdain of the traditional system with the rest of us. This is how i came across $PEPE several days ago, but opted not to invest because like many of you im not into ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù. Im sure many of you have had a similar experience with PEPE or Queen Elizabeth Inu or SHIB or Mongoosecoin etc.

Seeing these giant green candles i said ‚Äúits okay itll dump‚Äù. It didnt. Sidelined watching its market cap go from 20M to 300M. I know its money i never had therefore money never lost, but sad to watch the ship set sail and then i came across this tweet:

&gt; its ok if you dont wanna touch it because it doesnt suit your timeframe preference or style but realize ""its gonna go to zero eventually"" talk is exactly what tardfi ppl say about crypto, ppl getting rich on not-your-bags is not a threat to your profitability or your self worth.

Im guilty of this too and in the future will try to be more constructive with my opinions.

people blaming sub missing pepe,"I don't know if these are spam accounts or if they're actually r/CC daily users that are complaining but I've seen a consistent stream of posts and comments about how they missed out on pepe because they listened to others in this sub. I don't think that the majority of people here want anyone to miss out on profits, but also the majority of people here have seen people burned over and over by these pump and dump shitcoins. Personally, I know a guy that got in ""early"" on the SHIB hype and made about 40k off some of the people that got in later. Naturally he was pretty amped up about that and I was happy for him. Well, long story short he took that 40k and put it in the next ""big thing."" expecting to get rich. That next ""big thing"" is called JACY, it's down 97.66% from the ATH, it's got less than 2k in daily volume, and his bag is currently worth less than $500. Now, of course, everyone reading this that feels that they're smarter than him and that they wouldn't continue to gamble their profits on the next ""big thing"", I say to you good luck. Greed is a cruel mistress, we're only human and humans are full of mistakes. Stop blaming this sub for your decisions.

crypto disappoints greatly meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even.

I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with. I think it makes the space look immature and basically slows adoption by directing focus onto such nonsense. Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing.

If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso. And I really know deep in my heart a rug is coming, either that or they just suck the life out of it as more liquidity replaces the old suckers. If you want to contribute to something like this, you are the reason we are laughed at as a community. They don't see the good projects in the mainstream, only the jokes. And this is one of the biggest jokes yet, same as any meme coin before it. If you want to actively work against the community as a whole, what better way than to support this crap. Downvote me all you want I'm just sick of these shitty meme coins dominating the news when we should be focusing on more important matters, like the fucking recession coming. But hey let's just get distracted by a fucking frog right?

sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? 

The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming *shitloads of shitcoins* from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich.

Then I saw this:

&amp;#x200B;

$0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers. But *less than a penny?* Of course, lets look at that gas fee. PEPE volume has been insane lately, so I just knew I was gonna see some pain.

&amp;#x200B;

That's right folks. Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words.

Now lets have a look at this poor soul's transaction history:

&amp;#x200B;

Two transactions total. Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows.

At this point, it's just sad. This is like watching someone shoot up meth. Friends, please don't DEFI and drive. No shitcoin is worth it.",357,401,2023-05-03 03:51:00,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

changpeng zhao answers whether binance list shiba inus bone,"During a recent Q&amp;A session, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) spent 1 hour on Twitter answering questions from the audience. The Shiba Inu community was impressed after the CEO of Binance mentioned SHIB. CZ talked about Binance's support for memecoins, even though he personally doesn't understand the asset class.

CZ replied that he does not comment on specific project listings, but that the number one criterion for a coin to be listed is the user, although other factors will be considered.

*‚ÄúIf a coin has a lot of users trading and wants to have it, we will most likely list it. If the coin only lasted for two weeks, we probably wouldn't list it. But if it keeps its reputation, then maybe we will. So we look at coins from a user perspective.‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

CZ emphasized that he is not involved in the Binance listing process, as there is an independent team responsible for evaluating the tokens to be listed.

How long will it take for everyone to take a break before BONE can be listed on Binance? With memecoins coming back, I'm taking a break from BONE and RBIF which will be the 2 projects that will be listed on Binance soon.

think current memecoin frenzy dumb dumb prediction next bull run comes crazier amounts dumb money inevitably flow,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It‚Äôs time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun.

Look, you can scream ‚Äúscam‚Äù and ‚Äúrugpull‚Äù all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market‚Äôs euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino.

Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat.

There currently aren‚Äôt many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there‚Äôs a good chance the next memecoin king doesn‚Äôt even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can!

While it‚Äôs uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today‚Äôs memecoin investors are tomorrow‚Äôs BTC and ETH investors.

To be honest, at the current stage it seems to me 95% of coins in the market has no real utility or intrinsic value. What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How can people not see the crypto market like a large online betting site when everything gains value from short time speculation and manipulation and when the price isn't really correlated with the quality of the product. It's just all the hype (looking at you PEPE). Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever.

crypto open mostly decentralised means people whatever want never follow ideology however reasonable,"Hi everyone, I just need to get this off my chest.

There are so many rants about meme coins in this sub. Users are patting each other on the back and everyone seems to know what crypto is supposed to be. Do I think tokens like Shiba INU or that new frog coin are a total gamble? Yes. Do I think we need to change that? No!

*Open and decentralised doesn't mean you will get it your way.* It doesn't mean that we have to follow its inventor Satoshi, he's not Jesus and the bitcoin whitepaper is not the bible (looking at you, r/ bitcoin).

Another example for that principle is democracy. In my country, people are outraged by far-right parties in our parliaments. Well, that's democracy, people. There's no point in protesting  against a party that has been elected into our government, you should rather educate people and make your country a better place. The same goes for crypto: if you have a good project with real utility then it will eventually succeed.

Frog coin owners will sit on their bags and move on to the next gamble - or they will end up with BTC, ETH and a few other tokens they believe in, just like many of us.",8,65,2023-05-06 06:32:24,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

almost became shibillionaire,"In April 2021, I had 100 million SHIB (or $70) SHIB reached its first peak in May 2021 and its second peak in November 2021. Before SHIB had its first peak, a lot of my friends told me to buy either XRP or ADA instead of SHIB or DOGE because these are meme coins. Boy were they wrong at that time. Originally, my plan was to buy even more SHIB until it gets to 1 billion (or roughly $700 at the time)

What I did instead though just to make sure, I swapped 70% of my SHIB to either XRP or ADA via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and left around 30% of SHIB. At that point in time, I didn't think SHIB or DOGE would ever pump but it happened and I regretted that decision and wished I actually went all in to SHIB. 

Now let's say I got 1 billion in April 2021 (or bought up to $700) and then SHIB hit it's first peak on May 2021, I would have $31k (estimate). And now let's say I didn't get more SHIB but let it stay there until November 2021, it would have been $75k (estimate).

Basically saying that $700 could have been $75k.

But I said hey at least I didn‚Äôt swap all of it. But I still get a lot of what-if‚Äôs situations in my head that I‚Äôll never forget lol.

Fast forward today, I restarted my journey with SHIB and bought up to 50 million SHIB and I‚Äôm hoping I can get to 1 billion SHIB ( and make that as my next goal. I‚Äôll probably swap some of my coins via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [HoudiniSwap](https://houdiniswap.com/) or [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) to get to that 1 billion and just have them on my Ledger for safe keeping. (Not placing any of my cryptos on CEXes like Binance or Coinbase after what happened with FTX.)

It‚Äôs still early though, and I‚Äôll probably just need to invest a few more SHIB to actually see some gains. No one will really know what the future price of any crypto will be (this includes SHIB) and I‚Äôll just have to wait and see.

But hey, that‚Äôs why we HODL.

shiba inu revolutionary crypto project,"**A REVOLUTIONARY CRYPTO PROJECT** 

**-** shiba inu is doing something that has never been done in the crypto space before and this is my attempt to #1 fight the fud and #2 hopefully explain to some people unaware what is exactly being created.

\- there are many projects that have SINGULAR interesting components but there is no ALL IN ONE place to go. Shiba inu is attempting to create an all in one *decentralized financial ecosystem*

\- we have STARTED off as a MEME and got millions of followers with it but, we have something being created that has never been done before and i believe will revolutionize crypto.

**DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DeFi)**

\- this word gets passed around a lot but i would like to clarify

1. DeFi refers to stablecoins, cryptocurrency, DEX(shibaswap), money markets, LP,  financial services and more all that live on the blockchain
2. Currently, if you want to do any of the listed things above you have to go to different services/projects.

**SHIBA INUS FULLY DECENTRALIZED ECOSYSTEM**

\- currently a lot of the following projects are under works.. the project hasnt been out for a very long time and it takes TIME to build all of the following.. (so when you ask WEN just know about ALL thats going on.)

\- when everything is completed (unknown timeframe) in theory shiba inu will be an all in one project to use DeFi

1. Shibaswap (DEX) - Here you can swap your tokens for others, stake, buy NFTS and provide liquidity to earn rewards + MORE
2. Shibarium - L2 blockchain that is set to have LOW gas fees and FAST transaction fees. This is set to be the HEART of the entire ecosystem and project. We will NOT have to use HIGH Ethereum gas fees once this is launched on all listed aspects of the project. It will use ***BONE as the gas fee***
3. Shiba Eternity - a card game that has been released in the APP store. It is coming to the blockchain soon where it will run on shibarium and you will be able to earn rewards by playing.
4. Shiba Metaverse - Here we will be able to explore explore, learn and interact with a customized universe. The users will be able to earn passive income, collect resources, generate rewards and build their own project and space!
5. Shiboshis NFT's - currently 10k unique NFTs were launched - you will be able to use your NFTs image and there will be future utilities for those who hold them.
6. Cold Wallets - If you would like to secure your crypto on a space safe place offline.. You will soon be able to through shiba
7. Big Corporations - When shibarium comes out they will be able to build APP's, and different projects on a secure L2 blockchain (ALL BURNING SHIB!)
8. Community - last but not least.. we have the LARGEST &amp; BEST crypto community with a self marketing machine to spread the word about any and everything.

IN SUMMARY

\- if you want to use anything related to the crypto space to earn money, hold nfts, create in the metaverse (or bang your e-girlfriend) etc... you can come to shiba inu and do so ALL on shibarium for LOW FEES AND QUICK TRANSACTIONS. 

\-  THIS WILL BE A GAMER CHANGER! even though the markets are down i still believe in SHIBA!!!!!

thinking back would done could anticipated fall bullrun beginning bear winter,"I think it's pretty simple.

From September 2020 to April 2021, there was a big surge in crypto values, followed by a big drop until July 2021, and then the resumption of the rise until November 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lb8ex1pl60za1.jpg?width=358&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8362170eb8cdeb0ea874a9c167f501920d7f808f

So imagine coming back at the end of 2021, to a time when DOGE and the incredible rise in crypto values had brought in a lot of new people, to a time when Terra Luna was just starting its rise and SHIB was exploding. A time when BTC was almost at $70,000 and all the ""influencers"" were selling the dream with an explosion of values until the end of the year. Nothing seemed to stop the crypto anymore.

One morning, while looking at your wallet, and watching the news, a feeling takes you to the stomach, for you, some signs are alarming, you feel the end of the bull run, and you foresee the end of the cycle with a severe and brutal fall over several years.

The famous crypto winter that everyone was dreading is coming and you need to find a strategy to protect yourself.

What would you do?",24,102,2023-05-10 13:50:53,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

coinbase needs fall fail,"I will start by saying this: I am not a fan of $PEPE. I spent exactly $0 on $PEPE, I hold none, I plan to hold none, I thought it was useless at the end of April when I first heard of it and I still think it's a useless $SHIB off-shoot. 

However, despite my personal feelings on it, [what Coinbase did](https://twitter.com/SpottieWiFi/status/1656450587683086336) was wholly unethical. To leverage your market capture as the leading crypto on/off ramp as a means to gatekeep a project is wrong. It really highlights the need for more on/off ramps and a severe bottleneck of the industry at-large.

An erroneous and asinine take on a popular internet meme used by #bothsides extensively... all for the sake of a hollow virtue signal is stupid. Not to mention it put investors/speculators (primarily new) at substantial risk. For what? 

I hope this serves as a wakeup call for the industry. It's nuts how easily one entity can potentially kill a half-billon+ project based on feels. The last thing this industry needs is more gatekeepers. Anything that goes against decentralization, to me, is antithetical to the point of crypto.

At first they came for $PEPE and I said something...",0,29,2023-05-11 03:14:47,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Thanks PEPES because this short meme season driven by PEPE community has helped the price to SHIB and BONE to reach bargain levels. 

Thanks Shytoshi for playing the card of delaying mainnet shibarium for when bull season really kicks off to take advantages of it and not launch now in a bear market.

shib tokens used mobile topups online shopping upcoming shib metaverse,"In a new development for SHIB holders, blockchain-based solution provider UQUID has announced that SHIB tokens can now be used for mobile top-ups, online shopping, and in the upcoming SHIB metaverse.   
 

I ran across this announcement on Twitter, they invited users to ""dive into the future"" with SHIB and UQUID's AlphaTopup service.   
 

The move is being seen as another step towards the mainstream acceptance of meme coins, with SHIB leading the pack.   
 

I think this innovation is cool since enables SHIB holders to make purchases online without location-based restrictions, providing an added level of convenience and accessibility.   
 

In my opinion, we should have more and more services related to crypto and blockchain on our phones, I even like to play blockchain games on phones, Coin Fantasy and even now we have Gods Unchained available on phones.    
 

This move could potentially have a significant impact on SHIB's use case and overall market perception.

However, Yaccarino has yet to say anything about the memecoin publicly. So her level of interest in cryptocurrency has not been identified. The SHIB army is excited after knowing that the new CEO is following the Shiba Inu Twitter page.",20,11,2023-05-13 07:02:05,,Shibarmy,

hex token crashes richard harts ethereum fork pulsechain goes live,"After years of anticipation PulseChain the copy of eth which will give you a pulsechain copy of every ERC20 token you currently have has launched.

If you have 1,000 USDC in the Ethereum network, you now have 1,000 USDC on the Pulsechain network. 

How does the new USDC on Pulsechain have any value? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ykhhzxz6miza1.gif

If you have one of those bored ape NFTs on Ethereum well now you have one on PulseChain as well.

How does the new bored ape have any value?

So now that we have established that we don't know how new PLS versions of tokens on a fork of Ethereum have any value lets look at what is actually happening to HEX the eth token that promises to give you more HEX for locking up your current HEX without the token really doing anything other that being locked up by user to generate more HEX, where does the new HEX Value come from?

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm confused also](https://preview.redd.it/5te5uy3tmiza1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5062ac6525e785fac86d408016bc8013bbc260e9)

Anyway since Pulsechain has no actual value in it, the users are now selling off their HEX on Ethereum to move liquidity over to Pulse which is crashing the price of HEX (the token you lock up for periods of time to earn more HEX).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ysb2sh7niza1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04519bc997e2541db3f8a1f76bea4caf26e6c067

It fell more than 50% before recovering a bit and then starting to fall again.

currently down 47%

The people selling their $HEX to buy Pulsechain tokens are extremely excited right now because they are seeing the numbers on their trades in the hundreds of thousands, some are millionaires on paper right now. They do have one small problem, those numbers are based off of PUSDC which is worthless since Circle is not going to honor a copy of USDC made by Richard Hart on his own chain.

You can see some of the PulseChain tokens people are trading [here](https://dexscreener.com/pulsechain)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ryqflcfviza1.png?width=1734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b1f08720acd053647b01156f7183cf12d5a8ac9

they are trading pulsechain copies of USDT, USDC, Dai, SHIB, PEPE, LINK 

This is going to end bad for the HEXICANS

In conclusion - it's probably better to risk your money on the next shitcoin made by a random anonymous person on twitter than investing in PulseChain.",65,191,2023-05-13 04:02:31,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS

shiba inu unleashes trading bot revolution shibarium groundbreaking megacap partnership nownodes may,"Development of Trading Bots on Shibarium

NowNodes previously published a comprehensive tutorial, on May 5, providing guidance on building trading bots on Shibarium. The tutorial detailed the utilization of tools such as Python 3.11.3, Telegram, Ethereum Node &amp; WebSocket access, and Node.js to develop automated trading bots on the Shibarium network. This development is particularly valuable for investors who may struggle to make timely trade decisions due to other commitments.

The tutorial offered by NowNodes aimed to support the Shiba Inu community in leveraging the capabilities of Shibarium. It encouraged community members to seek further guidance from NowNodes if they encountered any difficulties during the process. The fact that NowNodes has received examples of trading bots developed by community members indicates that the tutorial has been well-received and embraced by SHIB enthusiasts.

NowNodes‚Äô interest in supporting Shibarium dates back to February when the platform announced its intention to provide node infrastructure for the L2 network. This support enables builders to have shared or dedicated access to nodes on Shibarium, facilitating the development and growth of the network.

The recent admiration expressed by NowNodes for the Shiba Inu community‚Äôs commitment is a testament to the community‚Äôs enthusiasm and engagement. The development of trading bots on Shibarium showcases the innovative solutions and capabilities of the network. As the SHIB community continues to explore and utilize Shibarium, it further solidifies the network‚Äôs position within the blockchain ecosystem.

In conclusion, NowNodes has praised the dedication of the Shiba Inu community and shared an update on the development of trading bots on Shibarium. The comprehensive tutorial provided by NowNodes has empowered SHIB enthusiasts to create automated trading bots, enhancing their ability to make timely trade decisions.

trillions shib flow accounts large shiba inu holders,"Large Shiba Inu Holders Record Large Inflows

According to data provided by the crypto intelligence portal IntoTheBlock, the past day has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the number of SHIB tokens flowing into the addresses of large Shiba Inu holders.

The total inflow recorded amounts to a staggering 20.1 trillion SHIB tokens. To put this into perspective, this activity level has not been observed since March 23 and January of this year, suggesting that something significant may be unfolding within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Interestingly, previous instances of such massive inflows were accompanied by similarly large outflows. The recent surge is no exception, as more than 20.16 trillion SHIB tokens were observed to flow out of these large wallets within the same 24-hour period.

Though the exact reason behind these anomalous activities remains unclear, it is suggested that it could result from redistribution between exchange wallets.",17,3,2023-05-18 05:25:03,,Shibarmy,

shiba inu failing crypto,"Lets be real: Shiba Inu is basically a meme currency with no real potential for us regular folk to see any substatial profit. 

Ive read countless post and videos about expecting the value to rise but its been two years since then and its been steadily declining. 

This a bullshit currency designed with the  expectation that your average buyer will buy millions of  S.I stocks expecting a life changing payout when it begins to rise, but it won't. There's simply too much of this stock circulating for it to hold any significant value.

I bought 200$ worth of stock 2 years ago now it's worth 63$ bucks. It's  no big deal on my end because I consider any money I invest as money already lost, but Shib is Trash stock for folks would wish to become millionaires with doing any real research as to which stocks will actually get them there...

need software wallet,"A few years ago I invested some small amounts on Binance. Unfortunately, I got bored and never really studied much about crypto. Now I want to transfer those coins/tokens to a cold storage and close my binance account.
I don't want to sell because of fomo but also I can't be doing KYC every now and then for an account that is simply not used anymore for trading. Maybe in 10 years I will have more time to dedicate to this area. 


 The purchase of a hardware wallet is just not worth it considering the small amounts. So I am looking for non-custodial decentralized software wallet. Something that can hold different types of coins. 


Would paper walllets be a better alternative ? I really have no fear of physical destruction of the storage.

shiba inu shib price soar launching cold wallet,"According to an official tweet, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) cold wallet is finally ready for launch. Pre-orders for the SHIB wallet will start on May 29. According to the tweet, the wallet was developed in collaboration with Tangem, a Swiss company.

In addition, the Shiba Inu development team is in talks with Huobi and CertiK about the possibility of cooperation to launch this cold wallet. According to the report, the wallet can support up to 6000 cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the wallet is expected to have enhanced security features.

With cold wallets coming soon, it is possible that Shiba Inu's layer 2 Shibarium solution will also be available soon.

With this new product do you think SHIBA can come back? RBIF and SHIBA are the two projects that I invest the most in. So I hope that in the near future it will explode

take shiba centralized exchanges,"CEXes are for-profit companies, and for-profit companies, especially in crypto, can't be trusted. Their goal is to make a profit off of you, just like every other bank has been doing.

If something goes wrong with that exchange, you're screwed. I mean, just look at what happened with FTX. It basically created a ripple effect in the entire crypto industry. There‚Äôs the bankruptcy of Bittrex US and Voyager (Voyager in July 2022) but FTX was more damaging.

People have been saying several times that you have to own your private keys because that's really the only way to get custody of your SHIBA.

Use non-custodial platforms instead. Get hardware wallets like [**Trezor**](https://trezor.io/). Use [**ShibaSwap**](https://shibaswap.com/) when gas fees are low. [**HoudiniSwap**](https://houdiniswap.com/) if you want more private and anonymous transactions, and [**Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) and [**PancakeSwap**](https://pancakeswap.finance/) for lower fees as well. This way, you get to hold your SHIB, and none of these platforms have custody of any of your cryptos.

So start treating CEXes like public toilets. Go in, do your business with your SHIB, then get out.

EDIT: I initially placed Ledger but they recently have some controversy which left people with mixed opinions, some people are sticking with the company with concerns and some others think  that their recent PR disaster is a big issue. ",8,21,2023-05-21 06:04:49,,Shibarmy,Discussion

The way the burn is developed is controlled. 
This means delegators will know when a burn is due to take place therefore they will be ahead of knowing when major price impacts will occur. 

It needs to be automated to maintain fairness across the community. Not when someone desides to click a button to buy back the shib using bone then burning it there is far to much  fluctuations in one mans control.",11,34,2023-05-21 21:40:38,,Shibarmy,Discussion

Its crazy to think a meme coin got a billion ""invested"" into it in less than 20 days. 
Part of the issue is the hype train and FOMO that happens when something takes off but I think a majority of the blame is also on exchanges that are willing to list something obviously a meme and most probably a rugpull.

There are other projects that have been around for a much longer time and with a lot more utility than Pepe or SHIB but because of the publicity and hype the exchanges are just rushing to list these shitcoins. 

Pepe is anon, has no utility, no white paper and no real practical use execpt to fleece those FOMOing. 

Should exchanges be held to a standard at all? Or is it just going to be everyone chasing the money?",51,141,2023-05-21 10:50:01,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

hardware comparing model vs nano x,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X.

Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides.

Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods.

The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely.

Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware?

(Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Security chip

The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances).

Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this.

&amp;#x200B;

# Size of the memory

Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB

&amp;#x200B;

# Supported coins

Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

Note the table below I took the info from

[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

[https://trezor.io/coins](https://trezor.io/coins)

and had a thing help me make the table. They both support ERC20 and BEP20. Meaning any token that is that, both will support. I'm not going through every token to make sure it matches this. I'm only looking at the sites.

billion shib burned single project,"Recently, a project surprised to burn nearly 8 billion SHIB. The newly launched project called Blaze Token (BLZE) has started burning a lot of tokens.

BLZE made an announcement earlier this week, saying that they have successfully burned a large amount of SHIB, namely 1,238,951,893 SHIB, after this batch they continue to burn SHIB with a larger amount. As a result of these burns, the total number of SHIB tokens burned by the project has reached an impressive milestone of 7,955,814,803 SHIBs.

Although memecoins are back, SHIBA hasn't seen much volatility. Can SHIBARIUM help the price of SHIBA go up? I believe that SHIB may explode, because there was also a project that exploded when launching a product, RBIF. This project has also increased by more than 400% on the launch of RoboWallet

dilemma diamond hands takeprofit,"It's almost every crypto investor's nightmare to decide when to HODL and when to sell (to take profits or to cut losses).


I was lucky enough to get into SHIB pretty early. I regularly took out some profits to rotate into ETH, BTC, stablecoins, and other shitcoins that I hoped would be ""the next SHIB"". By the beginning of the bear market, I was happy with how much I had made from SHIB. But I did the math and realised that I'd have made so much more money if I had just diamond handed my way to the top. But it's also important to note that there were other projects where I lost all my money because I had diamond handed my way to the very bottom.",8,78,2023-05-26 15:36:19,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

update mod regarding spam amp negative sentiment posts,"Hello everyone. I'm sure many of you are aware this sub has been inundated with bots promoting scam coins and users constantly ripping on SHIB. I would like to ask everyone to keep reporting/ downvoting those who post spam. The mod team is working diligently to clean up this sub. 

Secondly, I would like to ask everyone to ignore those who are constantly ripping on SHIB. With the constant barrage of spam bots promoting other coins, it appears obvious that at least some of the negative sentiment posts are an attempt from outside projects to lure people away from our community. Please do not fall for it! There is no problem with getting hyped for positive SHIB news, or sharing hopeful speculations. After all, that is what this sub is for. Of course, those who consider themselves economic realists are free to counter those speculations. That is the point of this sub, to foster a healthy and engaging dialogue. However, relentlessly posting ""SHIB is dead"" or ""Shy jumped ship"" does not really foster any sense of productive dialogue. 

Finally, I ask everyone to keep in mind what our community is about. Sure, we can cave to the pessimistic users and allow this sub grow stale. But making this sub fun again would be so much more enjoyable. I for one, would love to see more memes! When users talk down on SHIB, remember that SHIB holders continue to be among the most dedicated in the crypto space. A lot of us have faith in the upcoming projects and continue to hold despite the volatile nature of crypto in the aggregate. 

Have a great weekend everyone, and please continue to report spam! We're working hard to revive this sub and get it back on track!",65,51,2023-05-27 16:57:05,,Shibarmy,Awareness

When your focus is on money, you've lost all. You will forever lose your perspective on life and live to regret it. Be mindful of how important and rewarding it can be to be a good person and help others whenever you can. I can tell you that from experience...""Givers Gain""! My life continues to be great and filled with joy because I have followed that easy rule to live by.

shibariums success boosts shiba inu list popular cryptocurrencies,"LunarCrush, a platform specializing in social intelligence, recently unveiled its top 10 ranking of assets based on social engagement. Shiba Inu has secured an impressive sixth position on this list.

The top ten coins with the highest social engagements in the past month include BTC, ETH, Pepe, DOGE, SOL, SHIB, BNB, Floki, ARB, and ADA.

According to Lunar Crush, Shiba Inu has recorded an impressive total social engagement of 7.21 billion in the past 30 days. This represents a remarkable 25.2% increase compared to the previous month. Furthermore, SHIB has received over 806.21K social mentions during this period.

The surge in social engagement can be attributed to several factors, with significant excitement generated by token burns and the recent accomplishments of Puppynet, the beta network of Shibarium.

Puppynet, the Shibarium beta network, has experienced a significant surge in adoption over the past month.

Recent data highlights a remarkable rise in the number of wallets hosted by the beta network. The figure has soared to an impressive 16.04 million wallets, a significant leap from the previous count of 14.06 million as of April 22. This surge signifies an impressive 14.11% growth in wallets on the test network within a mere month.

Apart from the surge in wallet numbers, Puppynet has also experienced notable advancements in various metrics. The total number of transactions on the network currently stands at 13.24 million, with a daily transaction count of 431,496, at the time of reporting. Additionally, the network has processed a total of 1.02 million blocks. Remarkably, despite the load, the network maintains an average block time of 5 seconds.",15,2,2023-05-29 17:14:28,,Shibarmy,

I would suggest a couple of things which I believe at this time someone may have mentioned already:
- Difference between people to people and business transactions, where People to people would be simple, but business transactions would be taxed. This tax of 1%, for example, would be the amount that would be burned (sent to burn wallet) when I buy something.
- Growth of Exclusive SHIB stores could and should be encouraged by developers, giving store owners exclusive access, or services, or items with commercial value. Organically, I believe the community will eventually do by ourselves.
- We could and should adventure beyond the imaginary and face the real world. Imagine a streaming service, like a Netflix but where you pay exclusively with SHIB. A game with play to earn is good, for people with money. But the dad/mom with 2 children may want clothes, food, entertainment for family, not just ‚Äúomg, I‚Äôm level 45 on this SHIB game! How much fun am I having‚Äù. Let‚Äôs support some SHIB startups!

That said, HODL is good. But, eventually, we will need to use it. Otherwise, what would prevent SHIB from value lost or even crash? I mean, if you wake up tomorrow knowing that now your SHIBs is $0.01 per unit, I say that you may not sell it because you‚Äôre now a millionaire, but you‚Äôd certainly do because you know many people here will do. And when they do, they will turn your SHIBs back into crumbs again.

I do not wish to convert my millions SHIB in millions of dollars in future. I‚Äôd like to spend it as SHIB. 

Feel free to disagree, it will not bother me at all. On the contrary, it will make me happy reading more than ‚Äúyour idea is stupid‚Äù, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not a economist/investor/PhD in some bull$hib your opinion is invalid‚Äù or ‚Äúyour grammar is awful‚Äù.",12,7,2023-06-06 15:39:14,,Shibarmy,Discussion
shib poem,"In a world of crypto, so wild and new,
There's a coin called Shiba, yes, it's true!
With a Shiba Inu dog as its friendly face,
It's capturing hearts all over the place.

Investors gather, hoping to see,
Their wallets filled with crypto glee.
From meme to currency, a remarkable feat,
Shiba Inu's rise, a market's heat.

But remember, dear friends, as you take a chance,
Crypto's volatility can make you dance.
Hold on to your hats, for the price may swing,
One moment up high, the next a downward fling.

But the Shiba Inu faithful, they stand tall,
Believing in the future, one and all.
A decentralized token, community-driven,
Shiba Inu's spirit, truly livin'.

With cute doggy faces, they'll make you smile,
And navigate this crypto world, mile by mile.
But don't be fooled by its others‚Äô appeal,
Crypto's a game where fortunes can steal.

So, Shiba Inu crypto, it's quite a tale,
A canine coin that'll never fail.
Whether you're hodling or selling with flair,
Remember, in crypto, handle with care.",12,4,2023-06-06 19:28:52,,Shibarmy,

binance crypto canada,"Hi guys, 

I recently saw that Binance won't be available in Canada anymore, I don't really understand why and how, I'm currently living in Quebec and I'm from France, my account was created in Canada.

I have:

BNB

BTC

DOT

SHIB

NEO

USDT

SOL

ICP

AXS/

MOB

And I'm wondering if there is another platform I could move all this to that you guys may recommend ? I did not see BNB on Kraken for instance. 

I would love one where I could have a dedicated iOS app, alos I have a server, maybe I could have them in my server ? (Not sure if there's anything ""self-hosted"", like a crypto wallet, but I though It may be good to mention it.)

top tokens defined securities sec,"When removing all stable coins but BUSD, since that was named by the SEC, 46% of the top 15 tokens by market cap have been labelled a security. Here are the notable exceptions:

* BTC -&gt; Obvious as SEC has said explicitly its a commodity
* ETH -&gt; SEC has not said it directly but has avoided labelling ETH a security when pushed even by congress.
* STETH -&gt; Likely will be lumped in with ETH
* DOGE -&gt; Not sure why DOGE has avoided this other than its creators created it as a joke and abandoned it until recently and reinvigorating the ""non-profit"" DOGE foundation. Also, ironically, explicitly being labelled as a joke by the creators kinda blows the Howey test out of the water since there was no expectation of profit, it was explicitly communicated to not invest in this, and it was only the haphazard community which initially formed around it that kept it going. So the ironic unintended consequence of being a joke in a weird way might have made it into a commodity rather than a security. DOGE is an interesting one. I don't own any cause I still think it's a crap coin and I'd rather have BTC. But still ... interesting.
* LTC -&gt; Another interesting one. Again, doesn't have a very centralised presence. Just the non-profit foundation. This could be seen as centralised enough since the foundation could be considered the ""governing body"" which directs development and thus the 4 elements of the Howey Test might apply.
* DOT -&gt; Probably the most interesting since, of all the projects, DOT has come out and explicitly and publicly declared it is no longer a Security and has morphed into distributed software and the DOT token is a commodity used to interact with the software. DOT is fully decentralised with a unique distributed governing structure or DAO. While Parity is the primary developer it cannot unilaterally update the chain and all updates must go through DOT's decentralised governance; moreover, anyone can put forward chain updates to be voted on so even the development itself is decentralised.  One would think, of all the tokens, the SEC would want to take on DOT due to its explicit declaration in Nov. 2022 that it is NOT a security and in a way the Web3 Foundation thumbing their nose at the SEC .... unless it agrees with the Web3 Foundation ... üßê ... or at the very least SECs capitulation that you can't litigate an organisation which has no control over the product ... hmmmmm ... sounds like a commodity.
* AVAX -&gt; I'm going 50/50 on this one. Its development is fairly centralised and there is a lack of clear decentralised government, but, so far, it's a notable outlier and has some interesting characteristics ... but ... does it be a the Howey Test?
* SHIB -&gt; Super centralised project. Total security. SEC probably doesn't even care about it because it's such a joke of a project.",63,126,2023-06-07 06:21:43,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

bear market adequate job cleansing crypto space bad projects actors although painful experience cleansing great cryptos future,"During the bull market, people often proclaimed that the bear market will cleanse the crypto space. Now that we are deep in bear territory, a popular opinion here is that the bear market did not do its job of cleansing this space. For instance, there was a post on this a little over a month ago when shitcoins were popping off

https://preview.redd.it/1vtnvi07715b1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4424647fdedfa4694e01eaa17430bff61808168f

It is true that we have not gotten rid of *all* the shitty projects. However, I would argue that the bear market HAS cleansed this space of a lot of garbage.

# A lot of the bad projects are down a ton

* HEX dropped 99%
* FTT dropped 99%
* Luna dropped 100%
* Algo dropped 96% \[yes, I count this one. It had 500%+ inflation in 2021. Sorry.\]
* Shib dropped 92%
* Doge dropped 93%
* A lot of the NFTs (like pictures of rocks or monkeys) are now $0
* All the other shitcoins that popped off earlier this year are also down a lot. PEPE dropped 79% from the high, for instance.

# A ton of bad actors have been removed from this space

* FTX is gone, taking a lot of bad actors with it, such as SBF and Caroline Ellison
* Do Kwon is gone
* The Celsius ponzi scheme died and with it Alex Mashinsky lost a lot of influence
* The Three Arrows Capital ponzi scheme died
* A lot of small exchanges died that mishandled user funds

&amp;#x200B;

Is there still too much money shinvested in bad projects? Yep.

Was the process of cleansing this space painful? For sure. RIP our portfolios.

Is this good for the space on the long term? If you ask me, absolutely. There were too many bad actors, and a lot of them got flushed out. Now it is time to build and innovate and be patient. The bull always comes back.",235,148,2023-06-09 18:22:38,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

gensler sues american kennel club promoting dogs,"Gary Gensler at the SEC announced today a new lawsuit against the American Kennel Club (AKC). The suit alleges that the Kennel Club played the major role in promoting and breeding Shiba Inu‚Äôs and other dogs, from which a large number of crypto tokens - unregistered securities - have been inspired and developed. These have included Dogecoin, Baby Doge, BONK, Nano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Safe Inu, ‚Äòand a bunch of other shitcoins.‚Äô Gensler was quoted as saying, ‚Äútheir dogs may be cute, but the Kennel Club needs to come in, sit down with us and register their organization if they want to keep breeding and showing canines, particularly the Inu varieties, as they‚Äôve been the main reason that the evil of crypto meme coins even exists.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese coins and tokens have bred out of control, much like the mongrels that the American Kennel Club loves so much.

understand sec may want treat mirror protocols securities,"I can understand why SEC may want to treat the 13 mirror protocols as securities, but why the regular crpto? What even strange is that while serious projects like Cardano and Algorand are being targeted by SEC, they seems to be fine with meme coins like Dodge Coin and Shiba Inu? Or is this a PoW vs. PoS situation?

&amp;#x200B;

    The US Securities and Exchange Commission has put the financial world on notice: It considers a range of widely traded digital assets to be securities, a position that could impose steep regulatory requirements on digital-asset exchanges. Recently announced legal actions against some of the biggest names in crypto trading will put that proposition to the test. Figuring out what does or doesn‚Äôt make a coin a security is still a major point of contention.¬†
    
    1. What is the SEC doing?
    In July 2022, as part of an insider-trading case, the SEC identified nine cryptoassets that it considered to be securities. On June 6, the agency sued Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest US crypto trading platform, over allegations that it illegally listing numerous tokens. In a separate case announced a day earlier, the SEC alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. also listed unregistered securities. All told, as of June 6, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler had signaled that it considers coins worth $120 billion to be unregistered securities. The SEC has said that its securities rules apply as well to crypto staking, which offers customers a return for letting their tokens be used to facilitate blockchain transactions.
    
    2. What does it mean for something be a security?¬†
    On the simplest level, whether something is or isn‚Äôt a security under US rules comes down to how much it looks like shares issued by a company raising money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Under that framework, an asset can be under SEC purview when it involves investors kicking in money with the intention of profiting from the efforts of the organization‚Äôs leadership. In 2020, the agency sued Ripple Labs Inc. for allegedly raising money by selling the XRP digital token without registering it as a security. The SEC claimed that the company was funding its growth by issuing XRP to investors betting that its value would rise. The case is now a massive legal battle, with Ripple having hired a former SEC chair, Mary Jo White, as an attorney.
    
    3. Why does calling a token a security matter?¬†
    Among other things, it makes running a cryptocurrency exchange more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection requirements for platforms and issuers. That means exchanges would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in a worst case, prosecutions if criminal authorities ever got involved. Supporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors because of the SEC disclosure requirements that would apply.
    
    4. Who‚Äôs against that approach?¬†
    Crypto enthusiasts say that their ventures are decentralized in a way that makes old rules a poor fit, and crypto trading platforms argue that the assets they‚Äôre listing should be considered commodities, not securities. In the US, rules governing trading of commodities and their derivatives are focused more on ensuring that companies, producers and farmers can effectively hedge against risks of price swings in commodities.
    
    5. What does the crypto community want?
    There have been efforts on Capitol Hill to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives watchdog, more power to regulate cryptoassets directly. Currently it primarily oversees crypto futures and has the ability to take enforcement action if there‚Äôs fraud or manipulation in the underlying market, as it has in dozens of crypto cases. The CFTC‚Äôs regulatory regime is considered less onerous than the SEC‚Äôs, so it‚Äôs little surprise that the crypto crowd wants to be overseen by the CFTC. In 2022, crypto executives and titans of traditional markets like Citadel Securities joined an industry push behind a bill from top lawmakers on the Senate Agriculture Committee that would give the derivatives regulator more turf ‚Äî at the expense of the SEC. That effort stalled after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was one of the most vocal companies pushing for the change. More recently, two key House Republicans proposed giving authority to the CFTC to oversee certain tokens and create a pathway for coins that begin as securities to eventually be regulated as commodities.
    ¬†
    6. What coins are and aren‚Äôt considered a security?
    Beyond the very biggest cryptocurrency, there‚Äôs a lot of ambiguity. US regulators including the SEC agree that Bitcoin, which is by far the largest digital asset, isn‚Äôt a security. It was started by an unknown person or persons going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and does not exist as a way to raise money for a specific project. The second-biggest token, Ether, was deemed not to be a security during President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration; a senior SEC official signaled that while it may have started out as a security ‚Äî the Ethereum Foundation used it to raise money ‚Äî it had grown into something sufficiently decentralized that it probably no longer was one. But after Ethereum changed to a system in which coins that are ‚Äústaked‚Äù play a role in recording transactions, Gensler said that the fact that staked coins can earn interest might lead regulators to start treating it as a security. The CFTC, however, deems Ether a commodity.
    
    7. Is this an issue elsewhere?¬†
    Yes. Globally, different regulators have taken a range of positions on whether to treat cryptocurrencies as securities. The UK‚Äôs Financial Conduct Agency regulates digital assets it considers investments that come with rights to repayment or a share in profits, while ‚Äúpayment tokens‚Äù like Bitcoin or ‚Äúutility tokens‚Äù that provide access to a service are unregulated. Singapore regulates both types but under different laws. It considers coins that are digital representations of other assets, such as unlisted shares, to be securities. European lawmakers in April approved a law imposing common cryptocurrency rules across all 27 member states and calling for a new legal framework to regulate public offers of cryptoassets.

important shibarium shib investors,"Shibarium's role is not only to reduce gas fees and increase transactions, but its role is hope. If Shibarium's inbuilt combustion mechanism removes trillions of SHIB tokens from circulation each year, the sky is the limit. In summary, Shibarium is the most important aspect that can make investors' dreams come true in the long run.

At press time, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000660 and is up 2% in 24-hour trading on the day. SHIB is down 92.32% from the all-time high of $0.00008616 it reached in October 2021.

Do people have faith that SHIBA can make a comeback? I believe with upcoming projects SHIBA can still make a comeback. Typically RoboWallet, they have also recently been very successful when launching RoboWallet which helped increase the price by more than 400%

new scam alert victim buys legit crypto receives near worthless shib token instead,"Earth, June 12, Rueters. In a socking new scam, innocent buyers of crypto are finding that instead of the token they expected to make money with, thousands are being duped into buying the worthless token SHIB.

SHIB (alternatively spelled SHIt) is a dog themed crypto token with one fascinating feature- an incredible ability to only go down in price. Buyers are finding it is not what they bargained for.

""I just wanted to make money like so many other people did with their crypto"", states one buyer. ""But I'm down 55% now. Oh, make that down 57% now, of course.""

Worse yet, buyers of SHIt often found themselves being gaslighted by the very community they seek out for guidance. Despite pleas for a rational assessment of the coin's clearly diminishing value, doubtful buyers face difficulties with the more dedicated owners of SHIt. 

With cries of ""Shibarium will be bigger than Wellys!"" and ""I'm HODLing for my great-great-great-great grandchildren's grandchildren!"", these SHIt owners present a united front of stupidity and financial innumeracy that most normal people find hard to stomach.

""Oh, I'm just supposed to hooold now"", grumbled one buyer considered to be a whale by most SHIt holders. ""I just wanted to own millions of something. Now poof, there's $35 I'll never see again.""",4,8,2023-06-13 10:48:52,,Shibarmy,Humor

would participate burns could win back,"Title sums it up, but here a bit more detail. I want to keep the burn going, and create a bit of hype around it... So here's my idea, it's pretty much a burn loto.
Each 1 000 000 Shiba gives you one entry, rounded down, so 2 999 999 is sadly only two entries. Until Shibarium is live, check gas fees as it's the amount received, not the amount sent. If the same address sends twice, numbers add up.  So if you had sent 2 999 999 and then send 1 000 001, you'll get 4 entries. Each Friday, if the pot is over 10 000 000 Shib, it will be splited that way : 10% rolls on for next week, this will help maintain the hype. 35 % will go to a randomly selected winner based on all entries. 50 % will go to burn address and the last 5% will be used to cover for gas fees. If gas is too high, gas fees will be taken from the burned 50%.
I would get a website and do a bit of work to set that up, so before I do that, I want to see the general feeling. Feel free to comment and please vote so I can see if people would actually participate.

consider buying used crypto second hand market,"Like many of you I've always bought crypto new, either from exchanges or other people. It never really crossed my mind that you could get the same quality of crypto, just slightly used for a lot less.

I get that some of you might have some reservations against used crypto and for good reason but I've never ever enountered serious issues aside one time. I bought ETH from craigslist and when I went to the seller to collect them they weren't in the conditions he depicted in pictures. I renegotiated and got another 20% discount. I don't really care about warranty since I've never had any crypto aside from SHIB break within 2 years.

use nowpayments instead selling shib,"***Please  note that I wrote this originally in 2021. I am posting this here as a  point of discussion on how regulation has changed in the last 2 years.***

You  can buy your lambo/castle with NowPayments. NowPayments can even be  used to pay bills and/or a mortgage. NowPayments is accepted in over 180  countries, including the USA.

Benefits of using NowPayments instead of cashing out your SHIB into the bank:

1. NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX. Buying your lambo with crypto means you won't have to pay capital gains tax. Proof (valid 2021): [https://imgur.com/a/RuPU2eE](https://imgur.com/a/RuPU2eE)
2. PREVENTS  THE PRICE OF SHIB FROM DROPPING. Buying your lambo with SHIB keeps SHIB  within the SHIB investor pool instead of dumping the price. You can  have your lambo and still keep the rest of your SHIB at the price it was  when everyone bought their lambos at the same time you did. Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/GMYOUmJ](https://imgur.com/a/GMYOUmJ)
3. IT  BURNS SHIB WITH EVERY TRANSACTION. A percentage of SHIB is burned with  every lambo bought with SHIB instead of USD or whatever bank currency  you use.

We can make  SHIB a forever thing instead of just a ""sell when I have enough for  lambo"" thing. Get your lambo WITHOUT dumping the price of SHIB. Give  back to the community. And keep the price growing forever.

**EDIT 2023:**

***Regarding point 1. NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX:***

**Please  note that the IRS' decision to consider crypto a taxable asset was NOT voted upon by the American public and was NOT given a fair trial to law.**

Any laws actualized without citizen consent *SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LAWS*. NowPayments currently abides by the IRS' arbitrary decision, NOT LAW, to make crypto a taxable asset.

My point is still true that, should you choose to obey the IRS' dirigisme, you do not have to pay capital gains tax if 1. You've held the taxable asset for over 1 year, and 2. Your reported  income is less than or equal to the marginal capital gains tax cutoff for the current year (filing single, $44,625, valid 2023)",5,2,2023-06-15 15:37:21,,Shibarmy,

top crypto subreddits size,"Below is a table of the largest crypto subreddits by size. This is a gauge of how much these coins/tokens and crypto related items have a community on Reddit. However, this is probably not a good indicator of active community as some of these subreddits are much older with people joining over time and then not interacting with the sub any more.

There are a few large subreddits that are related to a single coin such as ethereum/shib. I have tried to find all the major crypto subreddits but I am sure I missed a few. I have also included some that are general and not specific to a coin such as this very sub. Some subs were shown as the same number of subscribers so I shared the same rank (eg, the btc and BitcoinBeginners sub both had 1.1 million).

project believe supposedly great fundamentals doesnt mean perform better shitcoin laugh people buying,"Just speaking on this community, there is constantly laughs about how people got suckered into buying shitcoins like Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and that they deserve it... And it's coming from same people that got suckered into buying ''big fundamentals'' projects like Algo, LRC, Nano in their, or close to their all time highs.

 For example the 3 shitcoins I mentioned are down this much from their all time high: 91%, 92%, 79%, where as these 3 projects that were all over this community are down this much from their all time highs: 97%, 95%, 98%.

crypto vs inflation,"ELI5 - How would mass adoption of crypto combat inflation?

I keep hearing that mass adoption of crypto would combat inflation, but I don't understand how.

Suppose we all change to using, say, SHIB tomorrow, and we start out where, on average, minimum wage is 10 SHIB/hr, and a loaf of bread is 1 SHIB.

Cool, that's a nicer balance than we have now, in a lot of places.

But how, then, does universal adoption of crypto prevent our corporate overlords from raising costs of things, because profits, to the point where, suddenly, min wage is still 10 SHIB/hr, but now a loaf of bread is going to run you 5 SHIB?

Edit: I picked SHIB just because, with the burn mechanism, it's supposed to be deflationary. But it doesn't matter which coin. I'm talking *actual* mass adoption, where the value isn't set relative to Fiat, because Fiat's been replaced.",3,75,2023-06-20 21:48:08,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

elon musk charged market manipulation,"This is a popular concept on Reddit but let me provide a reason no one is talking about: Elon Musk promoted doge because he ""likes dogs and memes"" and thinks that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. 

""Entertaining"" to who? Was it entertaining to late-but-not-too-late crypto tech investors who didn't profit enough from their legitimate investments to avoid eating ramen in 2022 and 2023? Was it entertaining to the people who built actual technical advancements in cryptocurrency tech and markets that have gone underfunded over the last 3 years?

To him, flexing his financial might is the most entertaining outcome, as he cripples crypto tech investors on their journey to financial freedom. 

How does he do this? 

Well, as we know, he pumps the sh*t out of the expensive, outdated, slow-to-confirm, hyperinflationary dogcrap coin and pretends that it is somehow better than the projects that actually mean to redesign the global financial system. He is a villain to all crypto tech investors. 

Let me take you back in time to October 2020. Doge is $0.0025 with a market cap of $350M. Elon had talked about it for a while, here and there, but he begins to really pump the name. Most of his audience doesn't know what a market cap even is but they want to make money and are the FOMO buyers that will lift the crypto market to its eventual all time highs. 

What he doesn't include in his analysis is the fact that doge requires millions of dollars of capital inflows every week to keep itself afloat. Every single day 14.4M doge enter circulation. Forever. Every day... forever. It literally never stops. At $0.06, with each of those 14.4M entering circulation (which is not necessarily what happens, btw, but it is important to consider), the market needs to offer $850K worth of support. That's each and every day and doesn't include sales of circulating supply. 

Now, let's jump to May 2021, the month when doge hit its all-time high. Its market cap was over $85B. (Only a handful of coins have ever reached that number and freakin' doge was one of them ü§®ü§Øüòµ.)

Let's take a second to clarify how market cap works: it doesn't take $85B of capital injection for the market cap to grow to $85B. There's actual math that exists to specify the exact number but for simplicity's sake, I always divide it by 10. Whether or not that is correct, let's look at it from that perspective:

For doge to jump to $85B requires $8.5B of capital being injected. 

Now let's add in shib, as it never would have mooned like it did without doge doing what it did: shib went from $0 to $40B, which means roughly $4B went into it.

Total: $12.5B extracted from the market (and in addition to that, the money from the other memes that mooned too hard and the whole meme coin fiasco that has since developed on the back of it)

Now consider this: in the heat of the 2021 bullrun, at around $45K iirc, there was a study that came out that stated that $90M was required to move the price of BTC by 1%. That means that every $1B of net capital injections was worth about 10% to the price of BTC. Now, take the reckless financial decisions of millions of dog coin investors and instead put that money into more prudent places like BTC and other top-10, -20, and -50 coins and it becomes obvious that the $12.5B+ (plus the carryover of momentum to safemoon and other dog and ""safe"" and ""moon"" and similar coins/tokens) and it is obvious that Elon Musk alone is responsible for cutting the Bitcoin bull run by maybe as much as 100%.

Imagine that... all of the moons this sub earns for ""$100K BTC 2021"" comments would probably never have been earned if not for the self-proclaimed dogefather. Someone find Elon's Reddit account so everyone can send him a thank you tip ü§´.

These are serious financial crimes that should not be ignored by regulators and I as a God-fearing man believe that they will not be ignored by God either -- Jesus once said that a camel has a better chance of fitting through the eye of a needle than a rich man has of entering the Kingdom of God and I have to assume Elon's callous disregard for everyday people will guarantee him inclusion in the category of the rich men who never enter the Kingdom. 

This man proposed an alternative to the true financial instruments of the future, an alternative that is quite literally a joke that was never designed to be an investment vehicle and/or everyday currency... and he did this because his autistic brain thought it was funny.  

Let me repeat that:

He thinks it's funny to F with people's financial realities. How out-of-touch can a person be? The man is sick. He should be reviled. He should be forced to make restitution to non-doge/shib crypto investors and then he should be put in prison.",0,25,2023-06-21 19:06:43,,CryptoCurrency,DEBATE

shiba inu price rises new shibarium revelation,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) spiked on Thursday (June 22), after one of the top developers revealed new functionality that will affect NFT in the upcoming Shibarium ecosystem.

The upgrade will allow users to link NFTs to real-world assets to provide authentication and proof of ownership for physical items.

Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain focusing on Metaverse and NFT that will operate using 3 tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem: SHIB, BONE and LEASH.

It is expected to launch later this year and will include blockchain gaming, ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù entertainment, account abstraction, and international governance, according to Thursday‚Äôs blog post by developer Shytoshi Kusama .

ufc musk vs zucc,"Here is my prediction.

My Prediction for Zuck vs Musk UFC 2023


Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of UFC 2023, an unprecedented event was about to unfold. The crowd filled the arena, eagerly awaiting the clash between two titans of technology and innovation: Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Little did they know that this battle would transcend mere mortal competition and plunge into the depths of fantasy.

As the Octagon door closed behind them, tension crackled in the air. Zuckerberg's piercing gaze met Musk's unwavering determination. The bell chimed, and the fight began.

Zuckerberg, known for his cunning intellect, stepped back and tapped into an ancient power hidden within him. With a surge of energy, he transformed into a fearsome lizard person, his scales glinting in the arena lights. The crowd gasped, unsure of what they were witnessing.

Undeterred, Musk relied on his quick reflexes and strategic mind. He circled his scaly opponent, analyzing his movements with a hawk-like precision. He knew he had to strike swiftly and decisively to stand a chance.

Using his immense strength and agility, Zuckerberg lunged at Musk, delivering lightning-fast strikes. Musk bobbed and weaved, his movements resembling a master martial artist. Their battle raged on, a testament to their willpower and tenacity.

Suddenly, as the fight reached its climax, a voice echoed throughout the arena. ""Crikee! He's a lizard person from beyond the ice wall!"" The crowd turned to see the unexpected arrival of the legendary Crocodile Hunter himself, Steve Irwin, bearing witness to the spectacle. The conspiracies of ancient creatures and hidden realms reverberated through the minds of the spectators.

As Zuckerberg and Musk continued their epic clash, Irwin's voice seemed to awaken something within Musk. With a sudden burst of inspiration, Musk tapped into the power of the burgeoning crypto world. In a dazzling display, he transformed into a shimmering representation of the popular Shiba Inu coin, the symbol of cryptocurrency revolution.

The battle escalated to a new level of technological sorcery. The ethereal Shiba Musk seemed to manipulate reality itself, diving into Zuckerberg's digital realm. With unparalleled expertise, he hacked into Zuckerberg's brain, unveiling the dark secrets lurking within.

As the veil lifted, the people realized the magnitude of the corporate greed that had plagued their lives. Zuckerberg's manipulation and control were laid bare. In a twist of fate, the Shiba Inu coin surged in value, soaring to an unprecedented $1.00 per share. A symphony of jubilant cheers filled the air as the people rejoiced. The scales of corporate dominance had finally found equilibrium.

With the battle's end drawing near, Zuckerberg, weakened and exposed, could no longer withstand Musk's assault. With one final strike, Musk shattered the illusion that had surrounded Zuckerberg and sent him crashing to the ground.

The crowd erupted in thunderous applause as Musk stood victorious in the Octagon. A hush fell over the arena, and in that moment, the people felt a glimmer of hope. The fight had transcended the realm of mere spectacle, reminding them of the power within themselves to challenge and overcome the forces that sought to control them.

And so, the tale of Zuckerberg and Musk's legendary clash became etched into the annals of history, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for change in a world consumed by greed.",1,0,2023-06-23 16:29:21,,Shibarmy,Discussion

ShibaSwap enables yield farming and staking. This means that by holding and staking your $SHIB tokens, you can earn returns over time, providing an incentive for holders to remain invested in the coin. The $SHIB ecosystem includes other tokens like $LEASH and $BONE, which offer additional yield farming opportunities.

1. Community Governance

With the vision to fully embrace the spirit of decentralization, Shiba Inu Coin allows holders to participate in community governance. By holding $SHIB, you get a say in the direction of the project's development, adding a democratic layer to the token‚Äôs utility.

1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

The Shiba Inu team has also ventured into the NFT space with the ""Shiboshis."" These NFTs, limited to 10,000 unique, programmatically generated pieces, have their own exclusive marketplace within the ShibaSwap platform, adding another potential use case for the $SHIB token.

1. Potential Entry into the Gaming Industry

The team behind Shiba Inu Coin has expressed interest in entering the gaming industry, which could potentially open a new world of utility and use cases for the coin, such as in-game currencies, reward systems, and more.

1. Philanthropic Causes

The Shiba Inu community has a strong philanthropic spirit, with notable donations made to causes like the India Covid Relief Fund. As the community grows, we can expect more initiatives that use $SHIB for charitable purposes.

While the future of Shiba Inu Coin is exciting, it's essential to remember that the world of cryptocurrencies can be volatile and unpredictable. It's always important to do your own research and invest responsibly. Whether or not Shiba Inu Coin will fulfill its potential remains to be seen, but its journey so far has certainly been a testament to the innovative and dynamic nature of the crypto landscape.",24,6,2023-06-24 17:24:51,,Shibarmy,Discussion

Is it a run-up and sell off, or are folks relizing the potential.  I like seeing it either way.  Now we need leash and shib to follow in suit.  Make this community and investment powerful again.  I know this is not a bone thread, it would not let me post this on bonearmy,  it's restricted for some reason.

everyone chill buy shib still low,"SHIB might have dipped two weeks ago, but as always, it soared again. And for anyone who bought during the dip, those are some great gains. Because just recently, SHIB just soared again. I just converted a lot of my other cryptos to SHIB via **Houdini Swap** and **UniSwap**. 

Just like any other pattern, it's always the rise before the fall before the next rise, then another fall repeats until one overtakes the other. And it's always been like this ever since. 

And most likely, there is going to be more rise than fall. SHIB has a strong community, is a great project, and the token could leverage that. The reality of crypto is really just riding the waves. But once you sell, well, you're just missing out.

Like I said in the title, we should just chill and buy low. There will come a time when we will go back to the 0.00007924 days, and we're all going to be OK. And once you buy during the dip and it goes ATH again, who knows? You could retire early.",93,80,2023-06-25 17:04:46,,Shibarmy,Discussion

bought shib year likely,"We've had just 12 days this past year where the price was below the current price now. That means that almost every single person that bought SHIB in the last year is in the red. Unless you bought during the last two weeks or so, you are down.

A little bit more interesting: Go back to 4/21, when SHIB really started to do something. It has now been over two years since then. And SHIB has only been below today's price 57 times.

Think about that. In the nearly 800 days since SHIB started, it has been at this price or lower only 13% of the time. 87% of the time, buying SHIB would have lost you money.

Whether you think that means SHIB is a future bargain, or yesterday's news, is up to you.",29,35,2023-06-27 14:25:05,,Shibarmy,Technical Analisys üñç‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

coins would included inverse rcryptocurrency etf im asking think really need one,"
I've been a part of this subreddit for a few years now and it has become clear to me that we, as a whole, are terrible at predicting successful projects. In years past, we have collectively praised NANO, LTC, VET, ALGO, EOS, BAT, ICX and countless other cryptos. Some of these did well, some did incredibly well for a bit, some did not do well at all.. 
However, some of the coins this sub has spent many posts completely shitting on have done amazingly well. These would include: SOL, PEPE, DOGE, BCH, SHIB, TRX and many others. 

How is it that we are so bad at this? What can we do to change??

I think an imaginary ‚ÄúInverse r/cryptocurrency ETF‚Äù would be a fun experiment to determine whether or not our brains are working against us. If we could put together a collection of the most hated coins in the sub, what would that look like? How would it perform? What do you think should be included in it? 

*Note: Before anyone jumps in to say ‚ÄúwHaT ABouT BTc anD ETh?!?‚Äù or something dumb like that: this post isn‚Äôt about those two. They aren‚Äôt part of this conversation. I think most of us agree that those two are both good, safe investments.*",1,1,2023-06-29 23:30:15,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

coinstokens miss boat next bull run,"So this is probably too simple a question but I'm wondering what people's thoughts are.

We know Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely lead the way for all crypto during the next bull run. While there may be bigger runners the big two are like to set the tone and scope of the bull run. 

But what about the others? 

Obviously there are good cases to be made for some coins / tokens about why they deserve a spot amongst the front runners and a seat on the next bull run bus! 

But I'm most interested in which established coins won't make the next bull run and will fall away (either by remaining stagnant while everything else runs or simply by crashing).

I guess Shib is the onvious choice but the meme nature means it could have another crazy run or two but what are other favourites to fall away into relative obscurity?",1,0,2023-06-30 15:49:52,,CryptoCurrency,DEBATE
