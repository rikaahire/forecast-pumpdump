Are we in the Memecoin Bull season?,"Many memecoin are pumping, the notable one of them was pepe which might have launched 5 days ago, now has a marketcap of $142M ,volume of $152M and more than 29k holders.

Infact, there is a post of someone who made $1m after investing $25 in pepe, this made me remember the bull run season of 2021 where some early buyers of shiba and safemoon made huge sum of money by investing $200.

The success of pepe token has also lead to imitations and pump of various meme tokens like $mpepe, $chad and others.

How and Why I came into Investing in $SSB (Previously known as Derpy) and #SatoshiSwap (Might take around 3 to 4 mins of your reading time).,"In late 2020, a friend  of my introduce me to the world of Cypto. It took me a few weeks of researching what was it all about and the various coins on the market. I made my 1st purchase in Doge on Feb 3rd 2021 at around $0.04 (FYI I miss my initial entry in Dec 2020 when prices were below 1 cent as I was still not comfortable in investing in Crypto)  and subsequently into Shiba Inu, Safemoon, ...etc. I have to be frank I was quite lucky in a sense that I got in early before the real pumps came in and overall made 10x what I put in after offsetting the losses in some shit coins and con jobs (using the 4 points written below). 

Along the way I refined the basis of of my entries after going into Wall Street Bets and subsequently by chance into Satoshi Street Bets. It was here that I came to set up my personal ""Crypto Investment Philosophy"" or ""CIP"" as I would like to call it 

1) Coins with real world utility or striving towards it;

2) Coins backed by Strong Communities (hardcore);

3)  A team of dedicated founders and developers; and 

4) Good trading volume

Along the way I notice a frequent person posting known as Little Eagle and little did I know that that person was actually David Gilbert the founder of this group until subsequently *(FYI I was scanning daily through this reddit group and a couple of others for coins meeting my 4 criteria)* so one day he mentioned that he wanted to come up with his own brand of Coins with some utility of a margin trading Dex so I decided to keep in view the developments. 

As the weeks pass by in 2021 and more details were released I come to a decision to invest into Derpy and Swap and did the Whitelisting and KYC and participated in Copper Launch *(FYI I did not sleep for almost 48 hours by checking the prices every 30 mins as I am very careful of where I put my money into, I even made a forecast of the price decay and it was almost 95% correct and happy to say I bought in at almost the bottom when the volume and prices started deviating from my forecast.).* The actual reasons for me to invest was due to the very stringent criteria needed to buy the coins and the reasoning David gave which was not like those pump and dump coins where whales swoop in and then sell, rekting the small fishes. I studied the entire whitelisting process, search on Diamond Hands Consulting Pte Ltd, the Law firm appointed, ...etc

And so the journey started, along the way certain elements of the Margin Trading Dex were altered and deadlines were pushed but it was all explained in a transparent fashion and boy did the evolution of the utility products evolved into a more sophisticated product then what was initially mentioned. Over the months the numbers of Wen Moon/ lambo boys came down and the telegram group was left with a group of dedicated investors. Its frankly very heartening to see David and the developers continuing to build over the crypto winter. The money gained during presale is still around and not rugged and you can check it in the blockchain yourselves. 

Around late 2022, David came and told us that he had won a lawsuit against the fake SSB coin. I took it up and started searching for whatever information that is publicly available and came across the court proceedings at the New York Circuit Court, the name of the Judge, the Trademark applications and the various jurisdictions the Trademark has been applied for.  This put me in a position where my trust in David and the team has risen up a few notches as you know litigations are not a small matter and to have the dedication to see it through and win makes it even more admirable especially is that it was won in America where there is a lot of bias towards crypto recently with operation chock point 2 in progress. I have to admit that I have been interested and invested in this project way before the 99% who came in recently and have seen the progress made over year. 

To those new investors, currently the progress of the Charting Platform is in its final Beta form and quite a number (more then 50 of them as far as I am aware) of the regulars at the SatoshiSwap telegram has been testing it although I do feel a tad disappointed not to have been one of them but hey thats life and you can't always be at pole position. As for the Dex as far as I know is that it has gone through 2 audits and is almost ready to be integrated with the Charting Platform. I read thoroughly through the 1st Audit Report and the minor issues found. 

Overall the final product is almost coming to fruition and the bull market is almost upon us, its like Crypto spring at the moment and the products and integration is almost on hand. You should really go read up at [https://ssbcoin.com/](https://ssbcoin.com/) and [https://satoshiswap.net/](https://satoshiswap.net/) for more information related to the 2 coins.

The next bull run will be all about Pepe and Pepe inspired meme tokens,"It seems like there is some clue to what could be the number 1 meme token of the next bull market.  I believe PEPE the frog and all pepe inspired meme tokens will be where most of the profit will be made in the next bull market.

In the last bull market, Shiba inu and dogs inspired meme tokens were the talk of the town, many traders made lot of profit from Shiba and dog related meme tokens. 

Now is the time for pepe and every pepe ( frog) inspired meme token, pepe has already paved the way with its volume and marketcap, that already has sent a signal that there are lot of traders who believe in pepe, it is also  signaling that the next bull market will be all about frog meme tokens.

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021.

Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago.

Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility?

Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. 

imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors.

Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market.

The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market.

If i was you, i would sell all my low liquidity tokens at loss or forget about them and prepare for the next bull market.",20,46,2023-06-19 09:50:22,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion ü¶ç,"[('What a stupid post.

ICP: The greatest disaster of 2021 bull run,"Internet computer (ICP) was the poster boy of the 2021 bull run, it was launched by a swiss non profit organisation called Dfinity in the start of the bull market,the founder Dominic Williams was called by the world economic forum, the next king of the blockchain, it got lot of support from VC firms, they raised about $166 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital.

During that period Shiba and co were also trending, but ICP was the most successful utility project, ICP got lot of free coverage because lot of people believed in it, it was the darling of 4 chan forum, they told everyone they could tell that ICP will displaced Ethereum. 

Exchanges were lining up to list ICP, On May 10, 2021, it got to an ATH of  $700.65, the coverage was massive, marketcap was worth $100 billion, ICP was going to disrupt cloud computing giants like AWS and Google Cloud.it was heaven on earth, those who bought early, couldnt believe their eyes, they were paper millionaires.

One morning, rumours started spreading that DFINITY the founders of ICP, has dumped billions of dollars worth of tokens while also barring its early investors from exiting their positions. Price fell from $700 to $500, those who were watching at the sidelines, saw it as an opportunity to get it for cheap, then it fell to $200, then $30, supporters said it was just a correction, so new people bought in hoping to make all time high again.

After the price fiasco, some researchers did some analysis, it was noticed that Dfinity treasury and project insiders deposited 18.9 million ICP, worth ~$3.6 billion at time of deposit, to Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, and OKEx and that 94% of the 8.3 million in ICP deposits from the Treasury to exchanges occurred on two days: 3.1 million on May 10th (listing day) and 4.7 million on June 15th. So it was an organized scheme to dump on retail investors.

The result of the analysis spread far and wide, panic shook the heart of die hard ICP fans, but they still believe,then the end came, ICP pumped no more, in a bull market, a token has crashed massively. Many retail investors panic and sold. those who believe in it and those who bought at the top are still holding.

On Aug. 9, 2021, Roche Freedman LLP, a law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against the Dfinity Foundation, Dfinity USA Research LLC and Dominic Williams, in federal court in California. The lawsuit alleges that Dfinity, the company behind Internet Computer, misled investors into believing that Dfinity and its insiders would not ‚Äî and could not ‚Äî sell their ICP tokens on May 10, 2021, the day that ICP first became tradable on exchanges, or in the weeks that followed. In reality, as alleged, Dfinity and its insiders could ‚Äî and did ‚Äî sell massive amounts of ICP during that period, thus securing substantial profits for themselves at the expense of outside investors, while causing the price of ICP to collapse.

Presently ICp is trading at $3.40, those who bought at the top are hoping that ICP can do some magic and beat its ath in the next bull run. They will go on to form a community on various social media platforms telling the world that ICP will be great again.",30,10,2023-06-23 10:18:03,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion ü¶ç,[]
