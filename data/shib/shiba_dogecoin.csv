Raising money to fix a bike.,"Henlo Shibas. 

I would like to raise money to fix a kids bicycle.

He took it apart hoping to fix it ( He is12 years old) but it turned out He can¬¥t and broke the parts ( Shift,brakes and even the chain). I promised to the family I try to fix it ( I thought it¬¥s an easy assembling job but I didn¬¥t know the parts are literally broken). 

I wrote a list for them what I need to repair on the bike ( cost 100-150 ‚Ç¨) but They said it¬¥s too much money but they wouldn¬¥t accept my money but I know the bike is very important for the boy,

So ladies and gentleman I found my old PHYSICAL DOGECOIN and I would like to sell it just for as much as it gonna cover the repair cost. 

So if someone would donate or buy the coin from me please let me know.

Of course I¬¥m gonna send the receipt from the parts and pictures how the repair goes.

Maybe it¬¥s a silly idea but that¬¥s all I can do.

Thank YOU for the attention.

A good Doge Omen,"I was walking in the park and a Shiba Inu without a collar or human around appeared right across the street.¬† It stared at me and my baby (who has a lot of doge).¬† I looked down to get my phone and take a picture and he disappeared.¬† I ran across the street to find him and he was no where to be seen.
