DOGE &amp; SHIB beat ADA &amp; FLOKI in terms of social sentiment,[removed],1,0,2023-04-15 11:17:45,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,[]
What are some promising cryptos and why?,"I am going to start buying crypto again for the next bullrun, which may or may not already be here.

I am looking for some suggestions for what to buy. Like most of us here, I am in it for the money, but I would like to know what crypto has promising tech and why/ what genuine use case it has. I believe a genuine use case would attract possible investors. 

I am looking for crypto that may not be in the top 10 but has potential but also the top 10, if you think they’ll stay there and why. 

As far as use cases go, I can see positives for the following at the moment:

BTC as a store of value. Scarce, finite supply. 

XMR for privacy (looking at its long term chart, it’s price movement isn’t great)

Doge for currency as it has a set amount mined every year, so it’s not too scarce and can be used as currency. The downside I can see to doge is that it is a meme.

Cryptocurrencies reimagined as bizarre mythical creatures! Now featuring Moons!,"Second try :)

Gather 'round, crypto enthusiasts! Let's embark on a whimsical journey through the enchanted forest of cryptocurrencies, where each coin transforms into an outlandish mythical creature:

Bitcoin (BTC) - The majestic Coinicorn, a unicorn adorned with shimmering gold coins, and an unyielding leader of the forest. Its horn represents its limited supply, and those who touch it are blessed with untold fortunes.

Ethereum (ETH) - The enigmatic SmartSphinx, a creature with the body of a lion, wings of an eagle, and the head of a programmer. It poses complex riddles about decentralized applications, and those who solve them gain access to its magical Ether powers.

Dogecoin (DOGE) - The whimsical DogeGriffin, a half-dog, half-rocket hybrid that soars to the moon on its meme-powered wings. It sprinkles joy and laughter from above, inspiring many to join its cosmic quest for galactic riches.

Cardano (ADA) - The scholarly CardaManticore, a fierce yet wise creature with the body of a lion, the wings of a bat, and the face of a well-read academic. It holds the secrets of peer-reviewed blockchain magic and patiently awaits its moment to take flight.

Binance Coin (BNB) - The cunning BinanceBasilisk, a serpent with an unquenchable thirst for utility and expansion. Its mesmerizing gaze captivates all who encounter it, and its fiery breath fuels the ever-growing Binance Empire.

Moons - The ethereal MoonSprites, a swarm of luminescent beings that dance in the night sky, casting a radiant glow over the crypto forest. They reward those who contribute their wit and wisdom to the enchanted realm of Reddit, creating an ever-expanding celestial tapestry of knowledge.

Crypto Religions,"Bitcoin: Judaism, the original Old Testament from Satoshi Nakamoto (or Yahweh), rigid set of rules, almost cultish, has few sects: Pharisees: Bitcoin cash, Sadducees: Bitcoin Satochi Vision...who all think they're the only truth.

Ethereum: Christianity, Vitalik (or Jesus) modified and enhanced Satochi's Old Testament to include a whole new set of possibilities and options. However a reformation happened, and Ethereum was split in two: Ethereum Classic/Catholicism is the old traditional Ethereum, and Ethereum/Protestantism is the new and reformed one.

Then there are a bunch of other religions and prophets, here are a few:

\- Polkadot: Hinduism, there is a creative entity that inhabits everything called Brahma or Relay Chain, and a variety of other deities specialized in specific tasks called parachains.

\- Cardano: Islam, a religion/crypto isolated from the issues of the modern day, with fanatic followers that would bite your head off if you criticize their religion or prophet Charles.

\- Doge: or Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a religion that makes fun or other, more serious religions and doesn't take itself seriously at all.

\*Additions from comments

\- Atheists are no-coiners or butt-coiners, they don't believe in a any cryptocurrencies.

\- Safemoon: Scientology, a scammy business disguised in space exploration and sci-fi robes.

"Nasty FTX backdoor dealings involving AMC stock, Doge and LedgerX","This is a cross-post from robotwizard_9009...

I have evidence that Robinhood, w/ Jump Trading, tokenized our stonks with FTX for Melvin

Firstly, it's important to know that Jump Trading is the crypto arm of RH and the largest holder of dogecoin..

Jan 25th 2021 : Citadel and Point72 give Melvin Capital $2.5b

Jan 26th, FTX tokenized our stonks onto Solana and Wrapped Eth with Jump Trading and Binance.

Jan 27th, Melvin ""closes"" their positions.. or.. hedges on FTX with up to 100x leverage.

Jan 28th, Blockfolio(owned by FTX) tokenized yet another copy of our stonks on eth, into bridges across the crypto landscape. One of those bridges is RenDoge.

Doge pumps and media declares doge a ""memecoin"". I'll say it right now, there was no such thing as ""memecoins""

Our stonks now exist in 4 places.. out tradfi, and at least 3 mirrors in crypto. The price crashes and Melvin makes a killing on an overlevered short position.

Feb 1st, Elon Musk calls Vlad

Feb 2nd, FTX officially partners with Ren Bridge.

Dogecoin was never a ""memecoin"".. there's no such thing as ""memecoins""

Dogecoin is inneffecient. Later, SBF is suspected to be the creator of shibu inu.  I suspect he made Floki for Elon as well. These were laundry devices. I suspect the end client was XRP Ripple. The official partner of the World Economic Forum, which Ken Griffin sits on the board. It has recently come to my attention that XRP gave FTX over $10m .. and are claiming FTX owes them $93m.

XRP is now looking at purchasing FTX assets. Whether that be tokenized stonks.. or I suspect, LedgerX. LedgerX is the only approved perpetual swaps in the USA. Approved by Heath Tarbert, previous admin appointed CFTC chair who joined Citadel less than 27 days of leaving CFTC. He's now Citadels Cheif Legal Advisor. Not only did he approve LedgerX, but he rolled back gary genslers clause in the Dodd Frank Act for foreign swaps reporting. Tarberts signature can be found on a foreign swaps with FTX in mid 2021.

LedgerX was close door auctioned last week by Sullivan and Cromwell, who shouldn't be allowed to manage FTX due to conflicts. Who bought LedgerX?

To top it off, Metaplex is a combo of Citadel and Jump Trading personel. They minted Degenerate Apes. A rip off of the memestock ape community. Highly suspicious. All of this. I suspect Michael Jordan is the secret VC behind Metaplex and was rumored to sell his NBA franchise to Melvin. He lost over $500m in the memestock event. He just auctioned a pair of Nike last week for $2m..

Melvin just came back from the dead to be a clearing firm starting last monday.Monday.. the day before the LedgerX auction.

Jump Trading was involved in the Terra Luna, Mirror Protocol fraud. This was centered around mAssets or Mirrored securities. These were tokenized stock products. Specifically.. tokenized memestocks.  This was not only securities fraud, but wirefraud and laundering.

Another suspect is LayerZero, whom SBF gave $30m. LayerZero came up with technology that puts smart contracts into basic messages. Once an asset is held in perpetuity, whether on eth, Solana or ledgerX perp swaps... they can mint an infinite supply of mirrors on any connected or bridged chain. This can directly or indirectly manipulate the underlying. They also coded a backdoor for their clients. This involves andreeson horowitz, a16z, point72 and citadel.

This is bigger than anyone knows.

Oh yea.. I also recently caught Citadel acting as a searcher and validator on the Solana blockchain. Jump trading runs Pyth, an oracle system. Jump and citadel are validating trades on solana and attacking the system with MEV bots to frontrun orders and do order packing. If you are validating trades and providing oracle price feeds, this can directly manipulate prices. Pyth is also specifically designed to allow bogus feeds without disrupting the system. Some data providers were showing our stonks a few thousand dollars away from base, or Trading at 0.  Tick tock.. apes aren't leaving.

Mismarked short positions are hidden in swaps. They used crypto and swaps to hide from regulators and authorities. DERIBIT handles %100 of solana options and %97 of btc and eth. Paradigm clears those trades. In an interview. Ken griffin talks about how evil crypto is. Less than 2 months later, he's partnering over $1.15b with Paradigm and Sequoia. SBF also gave over $30m to Paradigm and $30m to sequoia. All of this had to go through Deribit. RAY if the FTX bankruptcy had to claw back money and assets from Deribit during the FTX crash and specifically.. the hack that took place that week.

"Twitter wants to become the ""Everything App"" - whats in store for Doge?","Twitter is aiming to become the ""Everything App"" in the future.

 Twitter will also give users the option to buy and sell stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets at the click of a button. 

 eToro CEO Yoni Assia told CNBC the deal will help better connect the two brands, adding that in recent years its users have increasingly turned to Twitter to “educate themselves about the markets.” 

If this is something Twitter could achieve it would make Twitter easily one of the biggest companies to date.

What do you think this would do to the future of Doge?

Baby Doge Coin Surges by 20% in a Single Day | Gabbar News,,1,0,2023-04-17 12:05:19,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,[]
"Controlled DCA advice and the Curious Case of ""Inverse FOMO""","It was March 2021, we were only a few weeks away from my grandma sporting her brand new Doge shirt and your taxi driver handing out killer crypto advice. Memes aside, I soon found out I was a pro at buying high and selling low. After each, fucking, drop. I FOMOed onto the crypto wagon when we were well on our way to last bull market's ATH. And my FOMO, when BTC hit 69k, was hard.

One cycle of bagholding later now, I’ve learned my lessons. I lost some money on bad investments (metaverse coins and much worse, anyone?) but sticking around really paid off. Personally I'm lucky to have finally hit break even again. I really hope most of you are or will do so soon.

That early silly FOMO behaviour turned into wisdom and its name was ""DCA"". I thank our sub with some inspiring contributions for it too.

DCA has been my motto now and I've been feeling very good about it. Putting in that fixed amount each month now for over a year, not looking at the charts anymore after and I'm happy to report I'm almost at 1 Eth/0.1 BTC now thanks to this ""one little trick"".

But, here's the thing. I found it super easy and laidback to DCA during those ridiculously low bear market prices of last year (the famed 16k – 24k range). It really was such a steal. And now with rising pricelevels again, I'm getting nervous. I'm having cold feet about continuing my monthly discipline and even skipped last month’s DCA. Yes, 30k just doesn't feel cheap enough anymore to fully buy at (jokes on me, I used to buy BTC at 60k lol). I think I've developed the total opposite of FOMO, something like “Fear Of Buying At High prices”. FOBAH, just not that catchy.

So we all know trying to time the market is a very bad idea. But I'm toying with the idea of scaling back my DCA slowly, the more prices rise. I feel like I’ve become numb to seeing the market crash to bottom prices, and instead I only see opportunity at sub 25k, whereas I get nervous now that we might be at the start of a new cycle. I hear myself thinking “damn, I’m late” and I'm just increasing my average buy-in price too much now.

After all, even with the bitcoin halving upcoming I believe too that we will break ATH, but there’s no way to tell if the historical cyclical trend will keep on repeating itself. And we're all familiar with the infamous Shakespearian saying here at r/cc about what we actually do know, right?

So I'm looking for an open discussion, advice as I think it can help me and many other relatively newer investors.

\- Has anyone had experiences with “controlled DCA”, or do you think it defeats the purpose of DCA?

\- Have you been buying at a fixed amount under a certain price level and then scaled back your DCA-amount now that it's going up? (as an example: you DCA at 100% or 100$ when BTC &lt; 26k and at 85% or 85$ around 30k levels)

You'd have to be consistent and stick to it, and with inflation levels affecting most of us it might not even be possible at all to keep up with that fixed amount of our timely DCA that we once, determinedly, had set for ourselves.

So feel free to share your experience with mitigating the risk of DCA at higher price levels or if you can relate to this ""inverse FOMO""-feeling too now.

Let's have an open dicussion for crypto investors of different experience-levels, we can help each other be more aware of the psychological traps of some investment decisions, for better or worse, if we stick together and advice each other.

"As a relative newb, who is reinvigorated by the crypto space, I’m excited for the future… how about you?","Relative newb here - but here’s why I’m excited. 


But first some black story …

I’ve been holding since around may 2021. Admittedly, I got into it because of doge. I had been aware of crypto and initially wanted to buy some BTC early on, but was too technologically inept. 

So as Doge hype came in early 2021, I remembered I once was interested and figured why not, so I learned how to buy dodge on Binance and had some fun. Eventually after that all died down and I made a little cash, I invested it all in BTC and ETH and have enjoyed taking profits when I can with those. I toyed with different alts for a while, played with trading and then came the crash. I kept my coins in, believed in BTC and eth and let it ride. 

Today: the past few months have me reinvested. The market is showing signs of healthy growth and the ETH update went great. I have been toying with an AI trading bot making small amounts every day which will add up over time. But beyond crypt - there is so much to be excited about. With chatGPT 4 getting so much talk, I can’t help but think this will help fuel the crypto sphere not only because it will help by furthering the technology and software necessary for mass adoption, but as well as getting people excited about emerging technologies again. 

In addition, seeing the excitement around Reddit gen3 avatars is a big sign. I bought my first NFT because of it and don’t even feel silly about it. It has real use value. I love my little avatar and already can’t wait for gen4 to get more to mix and match with. The Reddit avatars really are a relatively unique, shall we say, limited, piece of art that has actual use value on a popular platform, not like some of the stupid images than can just be screen capped and used. 

Finally, while this is a bit tongue in cheek, I can’t help but find it interesting that the rise in crypto market coincides with the fall of traditional banks. ETH with its nearly guaranteed 4% return on staking is really a big threat to the banking industry as we know it. 

I donno, maybe I’m just high, but I think there are exciting things for crypto headed our way in the next few years. As a newb who really is mostly just interested in the world and how it operates and engaging with new things and not necessarily someone who has a deep and vested interest in cryptos success necessarily one way or another, I just can’t help but feel like if I’m recognizing this utility again, there’s something in the zeitgeist that says crypto is coming back into vogue.

This is how the Gary Gensler from the SEC decides which token to attack next for being a security,"Ever had the feeling that the SEC randomly chooses which cryptocurrency to attack for ""being a security""? To quote the wise Heisenberg: You're god damn right.

Actually, I'll give you some insider knowledge because my father is a professor at MIT: Gary Gensler use the famous pop bubble strategy. Whichever cryptocurrency he pops is alleged to be a security.

So this is your opportunity to find out which cryptocurrency will be coined a security next. Pop away and be prepared to sell if you are an unfortunate holder.

Here a interesting timeline.

* In 2014, Elon Musk mentioned in an interview that he owned Bitcoin but only a small amount that someone gave him years ago.
* In February 2021, Elon Musk added ""#Bitcoin"" to his Twitter bio, which led to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price.
* In March 2021, Tesla announced that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its products.
* In April 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would suspend Bitcoin payments due to concerns about the cryptocurrency's energy consumption.
* In May 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that he was working with Dogecoin developers to improve the cryptocurrency's efficiency and that Tesla would accept Dogecoin as a form of payment if the cryptocurrency's transaction speeds improved.
* In June 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that he had ""broken up"" with Bitcoin due to environmental concerns and hinted that Tesla might sell its Bitcoin holdings.
* In July 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that he owned Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.
* In August 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that SpaceX, another company he founded, owned Bitcoin.

"1 year on, Florida crypto-themed restaurant closes doors","This is a story of Crypto Street Restaurant which was based in Florida. I take most of my information from their Instagram handle @ cryptostreetrestaurant and certain other news articles/reddit posts. I will avoid putting any links in the post but if anyone wants any sources for any of this, I'll be happy to provide links in the comments.

Crypto Street Restaurant had their grand opening on December 9th 2021. They received some media attention, particularly for their crypto theme and having such dishes as Doge Dog and Bitcoinana Split and claiming to accept all crypto. One such example:

https://preview.redd.it/v8thls8v1tua1.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7e1a29d12503c8a733683560fadd612c1de5d4

Many posts about this were made on this subreddit and the opinions were mixed. Some in the comments hailed this as a big step towards mass adoption while others described this as cringe. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, the restaurant also received some attention due to being the interview place for this person accepting cryptocurrency donations for their campaign:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0e9r3gxp5tua1.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3280d95b05be4c00802f6232b244ecf4d72f985a

So, it is clear that by this point, most of the attention this restaurant had received was for being a crypto friendly place. But, the million-dollar question is, what about adoption? Did it help to drive up crypto adoption in any way? Were any payments actually made in crypto? Which crypto? And how many? Now, while the restaurant has unfortunately not released any official numbers on this, it is very easy to discern this from their Instagram feed. The reason is that *they posted a picture of the customers who paid in crypto*. There have been exactly 3 such posts:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy0yeqvt7tua1.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=681b53eb9c99eef25aa32446e9a23e59fda1b3ae

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't miss the Bitcoin pillow in the back](https://preview.redd.it/jlq813iv7tua1.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5de734996a3a35ba2b70b16621945cd1658fb64)

&amp;#x200B;

[Visible more clearly here](https://preview.redd.it/3aefa5zw7tua1.jpg?width=644&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ffdce5503acc9cf87257bf5d1d7c40e782c942)

So, going by this metric, throughout a year, they had 3 payments using BTC, which is clearly abysmal. Some might argue that they could've had other transactions that they didn't post pictures of, which I can't deny, but I feel that the fact that they even posted these pictures had to mean that this was a fairly rare occurrence. Either way, we have no way of making any claims conclusively unless someone can figure out their wallet address from the bar codes and check their transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we leave apart the customer's choice of payments, the owners took great care to make the decor and the vibe of the restaurant crypto themed, but out of all the pictures posted on Instagram of their price boards, not in a single one is the price in BTC or in any other crypto ever mentioned. Here's an example:

Finally, on March 2nd 2023, they posted this:

Now, why any restaurant succeeds or closes down is not something that I am capable of commenting on, much less this particular one. In fact, this restaurant had a Google Maps rating of 4.8 over 84 reviews at the time of writing, so it seems that their patrons were reasonably satisfied with them. This post is not to put anyone down or point fingers, this is just a case study of an attempt at crypto adoption. So is there a moral to this story?

"Which alt coins are showing early signs that they might be popular in the next bull market? Which ones are gonna struggle? Which ones are gonna make a big come back, and which ones will tumble? A look at what to keep an eye on before the alt market wakes up from its slumber:","# Intro:

These aren't my favorite coins, nor the best coins, nor all my holdings (see disclosure at the bottom). 

They are the alt coins I can see the market jumping on, sometimes for all the wrong reasons.

I don't have a crystal ball, but I have been in this market for many years and many cycles. And I'm starting to get an idea of what the market likes to jump on, what mistakes it likes to repeat, and type of coins attract hype. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What I think the popular alt coins under BTC, ETH, and USDT will be in the next bull run:

To preface, frankly I was disappointed by this list.

There's only 1 coin I really like on this list. But I objectively went with what I think OTHER PEOPLE would eat up. And yes, people don't always make the best choices.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.Matic** 40% sure

This is probably my boldest prediction. I can see this one being the most shilled alt coin. That's because most people will be coming from a stash of either Bitcoin or Ethereum, or both, before jumping on alts. And coming a little more from Ethereum, I can see them going for Matic. 

**2- XRP** 50% sure

All the negative things about centralization seem to have  been forgotten. It's starting to look like XRP is portrayed as the hero coin fighting the SEC. 

**3- Doge** 70% sure

Don't expect that people will have learned anything about the big pump and dump, and the hype. And don't expect that they will turn to other meme coins instead. Doge is the established meme coin. 

**4- ATOM** 65% sure

This one is gonna be easy to shill for those shilling the tech side. There's too many positives and good numbers. And there's a reason why it's already showing signs of being the sub's darling for the next bull market. It has quickly moved up in the top mentioned coin on here. But watch out, it means it will also eventually tumble hard, if inverse r/cc still holds true. 

**5- ADA** 55% sure

The ""scientific"" blockchain will strike again with a new generation of crypto nerds. Every cycle Cardano gets ruled out, and every cycle it keeps coming back strong. And for some reason, the bull market has a boner for this coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Other top coins: BNB, Polkadot, Link, Avax, Algo, Shib, FTM, AAVE, Vet, GRT, Uni. People are gonna eat those up again, despite some of them having some shortcomings.

Also, each cycle the alt landscape changes less and less. So we're not gonna see that big of a dramatic change in popular coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Biggest surprises, that will do well:

Alt coins that will surprisingly be strong:

**1- SOL**

At this point, it doesn't seem like the market cares about a coin being down or being shut down. Just look at ETC who got 51% attacks multiple times, and keeps coming back in the top 50. A new batch of people will jump in and go ""but it's so fast"". So don't be surprised if SOL has a strong bull market, despite its shortcomings. 

**2- Casper Labs**

I think this will be one of those new hot coins full of powerful tech, like Harmony was in the last cycle. Hopefully without the bridge hack.

**3- Moons**

Not to shill Moons, but objectively, bull markets helped boost Moons in the past from $0.009 to over $0.40, thanks to increased activity. And this time around, Moons will have mainnet, much more utility, and could draw more hype from outside Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Coins that will remain too underrated.

**1- Monero**

Monero has gotta to be the most underrated crypto of all cycles. And I think this next bull market won't be that much diffferent.

**2- LTC**

Despite a high market cap right now, I think it will be overtaken by several coins, and not receive that much hype.

**3- XLM**

I think it will be overshadowed by XRP. Despite being one of the most useful for transactions. It won't get much hype.

&amp;#x200B;

# The comeback kids. Coins that will make the biggest comeback.

**1-Nano**

Just from already a few shill posts about Nano, I can already see some foreshadowing, a return of the annoying Nano shills, and this one making a big come back. There is already the same narrative ""why is a coin that's so fast and with no fees, not a top 10 coin?"". Don't bother explaining it, they will still buy it.

**2- LRC**

Same thing. I think the shills and the hype never truly died, they just went into hibernation.

**3- Harmony**

This is another bold prediction. A new generation will come in and just see the really impressive tech side, and impressive numbers for TPS, finality, low fees, and see the big potential in their smart contracts. And when we'll try to explain to them the bridge hack, they'll just go ""that's it?"". However, there will need to be some revival on the team side for that to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Coins that might tumble and crumble.

**1- Tron**

This is a risky prediction. People could eat up Tron, and it's managed to do well despite all its issues. But I'm gonna wager Tron will finally tumble like BSV.

**2- SNX**

This one could potentially explode and do really well. But because of the regulatory climate right now, I would lean more on SNX facing some real danger from regulation.

**3- \[Insert the next coin that will pull an FTT, CEL, LUNA, etc\]**

There's already several potential candidates, and I don't know which one to chose. But I'm willing to bet we'll see history repeat itself again, and many people who didn't learn their lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

# How biased I am:

Moonshot small-cap coin - price analysis based on Market Cap multiples,"Today, I encountered a very interesting post about PEPE coin - a new coin that emerged a few days ago.

Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe\_mooning\_meme\_coins\_exceed\_caution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe_mooning_meme_coins_exceed_caution/)

Many people caught it early and made a multiple of their money.

In this post, I'll try to explain why you're most probably too late to do a 100000% return on it.

# Let's do some maths

The current market cap of PEPE is $100m as per: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/)

How much of a multiple can we expect?

Well, the largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $11b. I'll round it down to $10b.

So:

* If PEPE overtakes DOGE, it will do ""just"" a 100x. 
* If PEPE overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If PEPE reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, is it worth it to throw $100 right now? Maybe it's a bit late - it's highly unlikely that it will overtake DOGE, and even if it did, you'll have $10k - not nearly enough even for a lambo, not to even speak about retiring early. 

On the other hand, I think it's realistic for PEPE to reach $200m or $300m market cap, which will 2-3x your money.

If you want to gamble, be my guest.

But you're not retiring from this. 

Exercise caution and be careful. Once a coin is mentioned on this sub, it's already too late.

## March Winner and Loser

***March Winner*** –  **XRP** rose +34% in March, significantly outperforming the other Top Ten cryptos. .

***March Loser*** – After a strong first couple months of 2023, **MATIC** lost some momentum, falling -11% this month.

## Overall Update: BTC overtakes MATIC for the lead, all crypto in the green.

Every crypto in this year’s Experiment is in positive territory.

**BTC** overtook **MATIC** this month to take the top spot. This is the first time this year that **Bitcoin** has held the overall lead.  The initial $100 invested in **BTC** ninety days ago is worth $171 today. 

**ADA** is next, +59% since New Year’s Day.  

**DOGE** is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, but is still in the green at +12% for the year.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio gained $60 in March.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$1,402.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).

**New feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market instead of manually buying coins and tokens ([like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index.  Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

Here’s the question I’m tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.  Three months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/d4jnmwr0hvua1.png?width=499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892e9e3d9ca6ce44d08502d28eecd6f3b394dbf6

**March Performances:**

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**: +4% 
* **AMKT**: +14%

The March monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2023:** 

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $1,402 (+40%) 
* **AMKT:** current value $1,631 (+63%)

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -35% (total value $646)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +228% (total value $3,284)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +388% (total value $4,883) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +94% (total value $1,937)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $313) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +40% (total value $1,402)

Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$12,465.** 

**That’s up +108%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/dyobuj43hvua1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d7994a36685d5b8151495b74d0ceeb9c732ea0c

In summary: ***That’s a +108% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/35jo6s84hvua1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9e36f6d6c66d03f6fdd248af42682d594e70574

The S&amp;P 500 is up +7% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,070 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,540 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,070 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,470.**

That is up **+25%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+108%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

Most decentralized cryptos by number of full nodes,"We hear all the time about how some coin is more centralized than others, but the question is *how centralized*? A good way to measure this is the number of ""full nodes"" in the network. I compiled a list of the top 10 market cap coins by number of ""full nodes"" plus added a few I know to have a large network even if they have a smaller market cap. Full nodes are computers or servers with an entire copy of the blockchain that can participate in consensus. Node count is important for security, decentralization, and network resiliency.

In those messages, he talked about putting Twitter on the blockchain, banning all bots, and charging 0.1 DOGE to tweet or retweet.

&gt;“I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages/links like twitter. You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.”  
“My Plan B is a blockchain-based version of twitter, where the ‘tweets’ are embedded in the transaction of comments.”  
“So you’d have to pay maybe 0.1 Doge per comment or repost of that comment.”

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward many months and a dev involved with DOGE wants to visit the Twitter Headquarters, but it will cost him a few DOGE for the privilege.

Decoding Crypto Memes: A Tale of Two Coins,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the depths of the cryptocurrency meme culture, exploring the enigmatic world of two particular coins that have captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Hold onto your private keys, because this post is about to get wild!

In the red corner, we have the reigning meme champ, Dogecoin ($DOGE). Spawned from the legendary Shiba Inu meme, Dogecoin initially started as a joke in 2013, but has since become a formidable force in the crypto world. With a thriving community and Elon Musk as its unofficial mascot, Dogecoin has reached heights that would leave its creators in awe.

In the blue corner, we have a newcomer to the crypto-meme world, Garlicoin ($GRLC). Launched in 2018, Garlicoin was inspired by the garlic bread meme that took the internet by storm. Created as a parody, Garlicoin has since built a dedicated community of followers, all sharing a passion for cryptocurrency and a love for garlicky goodness.

As these two meme-laden cryptocurrencies battle for supremacy, their respective communities have been engaging in friendly banter and creative content, both online and offline. From Dogecoin-inspired graffiti to Garlicoin's garlic bread giveaways, these two coins have brought joy and laughter to many in the world of cryptocurrency.

Despite their memetic origins, both Dogecoin and Garlicoin have inspired real-world projects and charitable initiatives. Dogecoin has funded NASCAR sponsorships, Jamaican bobsled teams, and even water wells in Kenya. Meanwhile, Garlicoin's community has engaged in philanthropic efforts, such as disaster relief fundraising and combating food insecurity.

As we witness the ongoing duel between these two meme coins, we can't help but appreciate the levity and humor they bring to the often-serious world of cryptocurrency. So, whether you're a die-hard Dogecoin hodler or a Garlicoin connoisseur, remember that, in the end, we're all part of a larger community that shares a passion for decentralized finance and technological innovation.

And now, for the quote that will have you questioning everything you've just read:

Study reveals most popular crypto payment methods on Bitrefill,"# Study reveals most popular crypto payment methods on Bitrefill

### ETH is responsible for the highest financial usage values, while LTC, DOGE and DASH are used more than BTC's Lightning Network; according to researcher.

Data Scientist and Market Research Consultant Matt Ahlborg published a [study](https://twitter.com/MattAhlborg/status/1647966698845208576) on Monday (17) on the popularity of **payment methods** used on the leading cryptocurrency commerce platform: Bitrefill.

Bitrefill is an e-commerce site for digital products that uses **crypto-only as a means of exchange** for the purchase of: Gift Cards, Mobile Recharges, Gaming and Travelling. The company in question is a leader in the segment, with more than 400,000 customers worldwide.

According to Matt Ahlborg — who describes himself as ""a Data Scientist with an obsession for emerging financial technologies and their corresponding impact on our world. Specifically, I study utility usage of cryptocurrency and other financial technology within informal markets of developing countries."" — **His study aims to boost the cryptocurrency payments industry.**

https://preview.redd.it/4ihsr9pv24va1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ab7eb888d882a83e66b3afa558d2d01bc10650

In general, the scientist points out that, despite maintaining the leadership in number of users on Bitrefill, Bitcoin (BTC) has been losing ground to other crypto payment methods in the last four years.

He explains that there are several nuances to the phenomenon and dives into each asset group to understand the meaning behind this data.

In general, the scientist points out that, despite maintaining the leadership in number of users on Bitrefill, **Bitcoin** **(BTC)** has been losing ground to other **crypto payment methods** in the last four years.

He explains that there are several nuances to the phenomenon and dives into each asset group to understand the meaning behind this data.

# Ethereum is responsible for transactions with the highest financial value

Payments in **Ether (ETH)** have the **highest average value** among all competitors. Which means that, on average, **payments in ETH** are responsible for the highest financial values of purchases on the Bitrefill platform.

According to Matt, this can be explained by the high capitalization in the **Ethereum** **ecosystem**. Not just considering the market cap of ETH, but also the entire ecosystem with ICOs, IDOs, NFTs, DeFi, etc. — which end up returning value for the base token (ether) and then for its use on the platform.

The researcher claims that this large functional ecosystem is further enhanced by the existence of stablecoins such as USDT and USDC in ERC-20 token — which creates a self-sustaining circular economy, which keeps capital within the network.

Ether usage is prominent in the northern western hemisphere, with higher usage in North America and Europe.

# Litecoin, Dogecoin and Dash are more used than Bitcoin's Lightning Network

The scientist-consultant then draws a comparison with the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s second layer network, with other altcoins that he calls “Legacy Coins” — such as **Litecoin (LTC)**, **Dogecoin (DOGE)** and **Dash (DASH)**.

https://preview.redd.it/k6rpy09334va1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=747856ddbbffcb7602bb447c75d77312ca9ee6aa

Matt Ahlborg points to visible growth in payments via Lightning, but comments that it is probably lesser than expected by many enthusiasts in the Bitcoin community.

In 2019, for example, co-founder of bitcoin wallet BlueWallet Igor Korsakov [claimed](https://twitter.com/fulmolightning/status/1139451260539568128) that “The Lightning Network makes 99.85% of all Altcoins obsolete. I did the math myself.”

However, in February of this year (2023) the wallet [announced the shutdown of its Lightning Network custodial service](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio/status/1628733798438281216). And four years later, the data found at Bitrefill seems to point in the opposite direction.

The researcher responsible for the study points out as a possible explanation that the vast majority of payments in ""Legacy Coins"" are not carried out by self-custodial wallets, but directly from known addresses of exchanges.

According to Matt, the lack of support for Lightning by exchanges can be a decisive factor in choosing payment methods with lower fees and confirmation time than BTC. Another evidence of this is the increase in these means of payment during times when **bitcoin fees are higher or when transactions take longer to confirm**.

The scientist works with the hypothesis that Bitcoin investors who keep their coins on exchanges, make the swap to some of the ""legacy coins"" in order to save on fees and reduce the operating costs of their investments.

However, he also points out that these coins benefit from a lot of liquidity and trading volume in the spot market, which makes them interesting means of payment tools — with **DOGE** and **LTC** ranked at number 4 and 5 in liquidity, ahead of other cryptocurrencies.

A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency – 2023 Version,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” 

Now before I go on, we should pause here and really think about what that means. 

An immutable ledger. And really today its more then a “ledger,” which implies its only use is financial, its more a “record book.” 

A record book that can never be changed. Wow. 

Can you imagine if society had a record book that could never be changed? 

At least then we’d know the sphinx was originally a lioness for sure. 

But when you think about blockchain, think about it like a record book that lives in the sky. 

Every time there is a transaction, like Laszlo sent Jeremy 10,000 BTC, it’s written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever manipulated, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

In a deeper, non-technical sense, Blockchain, is also the reinvention of “trust.” 

This ted talk from more then 5 years ago is still super illuminating for those first entering this space. 

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

**What is proof of Work?**

While most think that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, there was actually many attempts before Bitcoin. Dating all the way back to 1990. But regardless, they could all be considered “first generation” cryptocurrency.    
 

First generation cryptocurrency worked of the concept of Proof of work. 

Here, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward for running the expensive hardware, and using your own electricity, you get coin. “Mining.” 

Mining, however, has it’s draw backs. 

First, it’s slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute. 

Second, it’s wasteful. 

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin has been notorious for the amount of energy used. When I first wrote this (2021), I sited an article that said Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina. Now its Norway. 

  
 But it’s not all bad. 

POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many would ague, more secure because of it.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

“Second Generation” cryptocurrencies introduced the idea of smart contracts. 

Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist and cryptographer was the first to introduce Smart contracts – back in 1994. 

But it was really our favorite 19 year old (At the time he founded ETH) hero Vitalik Buterin that would popularize the concept with Ethereum. 

But what is it? 

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. 

It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent,” like a bank.

But when I think about smart contracts, and what they could be, its really ANY CODE, that you could think of, that would be written to the blockchain making it also immutable. Any traditional application you could think of, like a warehouse inventory app, or commercial trucking tracker, could be potentially written with code that can never be changed. Which isn’t to say new versions of the smart contract can’t be created with changes, but having the complete audibility, forever, is invaluable. To the developer, and the customer. 

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be manipulated.. Ever..

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp)

**What is proof of Stake?**

“Third generation” cryptocurrencies introduced the concept of Proof of Stake. 

The idea was first introduced with Peercoin back in 2012, but widely popularized by Cardano in 2017. 

POS aimed to solve the “cryptocurrency trilemma,” decentralization, security, and scalability. But specifically, they wanted to create faster transactions, and for the system to use less energy, all while maintaining a high level of security.  

It’s important to note that not all POS systems achieve “consensus” in the same fashion. I’d say the one I know best is Ouroboros. A protocol, created by IOG (Formerly IOHK) and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians. 

They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. 

Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. 

POS is so superior, at least in the view of Ethereum development team, that they too moved from POW to POS in 2022, after a multiyear effort. Again stating that “it is more secure, less energy-intensive, and better for implementing new scaling solutions compared to the previous [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) architecture.” 

Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. 

Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each have their own way of doing things. 

Each system has different philosophy and implementation of POS features. Like, “locking,” and “slashing.” So, it’s important to understand the ones you choose to invest in.  

What you should remember is that for POW, POS, and others, are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.”

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. 

MCap = $ \* Supply

That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 19,351,768 BTC out there at a cost of $28,241.

That means, the market cap is 

$546,513,280,088 (547B) = $28,241 \* 19,351,768  

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. 

There are currently 34,788,770,948 at the current cost of 40 cents.

$13,915,508,379.2 (14B) = $.40 \* 34,788,770,948  

Cardano would have over a 1 trillion dollar market cap if the price went to $29.

$1,008,874,357,492 (1T) = $29 \* 34,788,770,948 

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Apple – 2.6T

Amazon – 1T

Tesla – 516B

Visa – 493B

Bank of America – 238B

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. 

Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. 

At times coins are “burned.” 

Try to take the time to learn how your investment will change over time, and what the implication of supply has on your price goals.

**Am I too late to “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs of the second flight. 

Global wealth is estimated at 463 trillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.19 Trillion. 

That’s only 0.25% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dip, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or “Dollar cost average (DCA)” by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market by either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. 

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implications with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your “Return on Investment (ROI)” improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 8K types of cryptocurrencies. You can create your own in seconds with many tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps. Or Rug Pulls. 

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, be cautious.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains will eventually be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a web 2.0 application. Not a blockchain. 

They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

This crypto-winter has been chalk full of these examples. 

Lastly, there is the notion of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With coins like Cardano Ada you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, that only you can access, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

And that last sentence is really the “key.” 

You’ll hear a lot “not your keys not your crypto.” 

What that means is that the wallet address associated to you is secured by a cryptographic asymmetric key pair. The whole reason this technology is secure, is because it uses cryptographic certificates in order to authenticate and authorize the user. When you use an exchange they hold these keys. They can lose them, or they can shut down and hold them. When you setup your wallet, the private key is stored on your device.

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are “metadata” attached to an “asset,” that is written to the blockchain. 

The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
 It’s a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
 But it’s not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
 Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
 IPFS is very cool, but it’s not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, mutable, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time. Or at least as long as the blockchain is still running.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get a new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb through chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and never again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Gaming is also another area where NFTs have potential. Its not fair that you can pay for things in game, but that you don’t own them. That you can’t transfer them. I should be able to buy a skin, and a dope sword, play with it for a while, then later put it up for auction. 

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
 What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if it’s not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

Fortunately, there are people looking to solve these problems.

 Hopium = Hope+Opium - Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.  
 FOMO = Fear of Missing Out  
 FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt

Crypto phases I wish had skipped...,"We’ve all had our low points, and crypto is no exception. I'd like to share some of the different phases I went through in crypto, all of which I wish I never went through. Hopefully this will save some of you from wasting your time and money like I did...

&amp;#x200B;

Trading on the Crypto dot com app

As most of you know, the CDC app has high fees, and high spreads. If you must, use their exchange (unless you are in the US) The app has a nice UI that works (kinda) well, and is best suited for brand new investors. Frequent buys and sells in app will result in losses that would have been easily preventable. 

* **Full-porting into dog tokens**

If you say you've never bought Doge or SHIB, you're a liar. I for one have bought them, and at one time had most of my portfolio sunk into them. We all already know how this turned out. Meme tokens are fun, and if you want to hold them, do so sparingly. 

* **Not understanding Market Cap**

This one goes along with the bullet above. The appeal to most shitcoins is the extremely low price, which tricks new investors thinking they have gotten in at ""such a low price!"" I bought a few million SHIB a few years back thinking it could reach the price of Bitcoin, oh how wrong I was. 

* **Neglecting blue chips (BTC and ETH)**

Pretty self explanatory. Sure, alts may make you more money, or may not...

* **Too frequently sending your money off the exchange**

This one is for my broke boys out there. When I started investing in crypto, I never had much, and gas fees were noticeable to my holdings. I'd send my crypto off each time I bought, dwindling my holdings little by little. I will never preach keeping your money on the exchanges, but you also don't need to send it off each time you buy. So unless you buy thousands at a time, maybe consider keeping your money on the exchange for a couple weeks, and send 7-21 days worth of buys to save on gas. It sure would have saved me some money. 

* **Keeping your money on the exchange**

I am well aware this appears to contradict the above point, but what I meant by this one is having the exchange hold your money forever. When you buy on the exchange, the money is never really *yours.* You are essentially given a carnival ticket that says the exchange *owes* you the money whenever you'd like to withdraw. The money is **never** yours until it is back in your bank account *(up for debate after SVB*), or withdrawn to your personal crypto wallet. I have never personally been effected by and exchange collapse, and I don't plan to. This is the only way to ensure you have control over your crypto. 

* **Having high expectations for returns**

Expecting insane returns on your investments will leave you waiting for a day that may never come. You won't ever take profits, and will be left holding the bag. *I'm looking at you CRO.* Setting realistic expectations will help you take profits when the time comes. 

* **Staring at the charts all day**

I can almost guarantee nothing will happen if you step away for a few hours, or even days. Rest those eyes, get some sleep. Everything will be okay.

How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it’s not a reliable “get rich quick” scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. 

Solana is currently worth $22.62/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021.

SAND wasn’t even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021.

Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested.

I know you can’t predict this stuff, but I think it’s still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there’s always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw.

I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off.

I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. 

Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it’s now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021.

Obviously it’s much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL’ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE).

Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. 

I’m not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I’m aware that it’s more like gambling, and not a reliable way to “get rich quick”.

I’m just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to “shoot to the moon”, and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they’re unavailable on CoinBase.

I couldn’t even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren’t allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won’t allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it’s perfectly fine in other risky investments).

You can’t tell me ALL these “big winners” are PURELY blind luck……

And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don’t allow a lot outside of well established coins…..",1,1,2023-04-21 06:45:07,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Hello cryptdoh6.

"After these past couple of days of meme coins rocketing off and people bashing them (for mostly correct reasons) I think we should have another look at the king of meme coins, Dogecoin","After these past couple of days of meme coins rocketing off and people bashing on them (for mostly correct reasons) I think we should have another look at the king of meme coins, Dogecoin. As I believe there is a lot of misunderstanding behind Dogecoin.

  
**Problem 1)** First and foremost is its inflation. How bad is Doge's 'infinite' inflation?

Dogecoin is mined at a rate of **10,000 DOGE per minute**, which results in **14,400,000 DOGE** created **per day**. **Yearly, 5,256,000,000** Coins are added to the supply. Though this looks like a massive number, how does it compare to Doge's current Circulating Supply?

Doge right now rounded down has a circulating supply of **just over 139 Billion DOGE**. If we were to add these newly minted coins then (making the **circulating supply 144,275,086,383**), **3.58% DOGE** is added to the supply in a year's time. Because there will always be **10,000 DOGE** added per minute, the % rate of new Doge created will continuously go down. So how about the years that follow?

* **2023-2024 - 3.58%**
* **2024-2025 - 3.45%**
* **2025-2026 - 3.34%**
* **2026-2027 - 3.23%**
* **2027-2028 - 3.13%**
* **2028-2029 - 3.03%**

In 6 years, we will see Doge slowly drop to around 3% inflation, and will continue to lower as long as it uses this system.

To this end it seems that DOGE's only use-case argument is as a store of value to be used for transactions. In other words, it wants to compete with fiat currencies to be used in stores (not as an investment). 

Also of note, the inflation for Doge serves a few key purposes; It allows for lower fees (mentioned above), it encourages spending, it replaces DOGE locked/lost over time, and it helps to keep the price low over time.

Inflationary assets encourage spending/using as opposed to deflationary assets which encourage hoarding (why sell BTC for 35k today when you could sell it for 100k later?).

  
If Doge was widely accepted as a currency, there would be a higher demand and with that a higher price. The inflationary nature of DOGE replaces coins in existence that are no longer accessible and helps to keep the price of DOGE from skyrocketing to a price that it becomes difficult to understand/spend in relation to an underlying FIAT value (BTC currently has this problem and is trying to convert people into thinking of BTC in terms of Sats).

  
What is Doge daily Rate of Inflation (RoI) and how does it compare to a few other top coins?

* Doge RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about .0109% inflation every day. (3.58% a year)
* DOT RoI varies but currently is roughly between .016 -.027% (6-10% a year)
* BTC RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about 1.96% a year
* Litecoin RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about 3.66% a year
* **Some perspective**: the annual inflation rate of the U.S. dollar in 2023 stands at around 6.4% (this can change drastically if they turn the money printer on or off)  


**Problem 2)** It has no use case/it's just another meme/shitcoin. 

For anyone looking to invest in Dogecoin the long term use case of Doge is most likely as stated above a global way to transact (I.E. Buy, sell, tip). Yes Doge might get some additional use cases but the long term goal of DOGE is a global transacting cryptocurrency.

* Doge has low fees, you can send/spend/use doge for pennies
* The reason that Doge can have such low fees is that the network is secured through new coin issuance (inflation) paid to the miners - NOT end user fees.
* Worth Considering: The richest person in the world supports the long-term adoption of DOGE as a global currency.

**Problem 3)** Doge is highly centralized to a handful of wallets and thus is a rugpull waiting to happen. The top 16 wallets own 44.9% of the supply. 5 of the current top 16 wallets owning roughly 30% of Doge are suspected to be RobinHood through various Cold/Hot storage wallets that are linked together.

It is inherently difficult to prove who is the owner of a wallet without the owner coming forward, on most coins (including Doge) it's often expected the top wallets are *usually* exchanges.

Additionally the current number 5 wallet is a burn wallet and owns 1.41% of Doge.

If we count the top 16 **unknown wallets,** they own roughly 17.54% of the Doge (which again likely includes other exchanges) in existence. A far cry from the 44.9% that gets thrown around.

Let’s talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. 

Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

So let’s talk about **Doge V Shiba Inu**

*Utility*
Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. 

Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. 

Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. 

**On-Chain Data**

Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. 

Doge’s active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. 

This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. 


While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba’s price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How a subreddit might have actually made at least one millionaire,"So, I am not sure how many of you here are actually aware of the /r/millionairemakers subreddit and how it works. But basically, the idea behind the subreddit is that if there is a single winner and everybody else in the subreddit sends them a single dollar this money can pile up real quick and change somebody's life.

Sounds too good to be true right? And by having a quick glance at the [table](https://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/wiki/index/past_winners) of past winners you would probably find what you would expect, in some cases still a pretty nice sum of money, but nowhere near the million from the subreddit name...

Well, there is a catch. A lot of these winners accepted donations in various cryptocurrencies, most notably BTC, LTC, and DOGE... but that was 8 years ago. Now you might see where this is going.

I do not want to dox anyone who didn't already take security precautions so I will only make a single example (with a now cleared reddit account of all post history) - u/grendelwasamommasboy who, in a [now-deleted winner thread](https://www.unddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/2q9ung/santa_is_real_thank_you_all_so_much_i_am_still_in/) received more than $11K by various means.

On June 23, 2022, Harmony One was hacked, with $100 million of assets on the Horizon bridge being stolen. The bridge functioned on a 2/5 multisig contract, so the hacker(s) was able to gain access to the funds by compromising the server and getting hold of these two addresses. The question begs as to why the developers chose to be negligent of ONE’s security system. In an attempt to do damage control, the Harmony team offered bounties twice - $1 million the first time and $10 million the second time - in hopes that the culprit(s) would be enticed to return the stolen funds. Unfortunately, both bounties were futile. To be fair, the developers do not shirk their responsibilities as they are currently working on various plans that address about 50,000 wallets spanning across 14 assets amounting to $97.6 million. Nonetheless, this hack eroded many users’ confidence in regards to the robustness of ONE’s security measures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. DeFi Kingdoms, a relatively successful play-to-earn game, hinted that they might be pulling out of the Harmony chain and moving over to another chain.

Shib and doge concurrence planned / new crypto currency conditions,,1,0,2023-04-23 15:58:39,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]
Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections.

I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated.

I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space.

I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

As crypto continues to become more and more common as a tool for investment - what do you think the makeup of a crypto index fund modeled after S&amp;P Index Funds would look like?,"When you take a look at many of the common low fee index funds that are based on the S&amp;P and have particular leans, you’ll see that companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google and NVDA are common names to be found and make up significant chunk of many of the most popular index funds in the stock market.

Obviously Bitcoin and ETH would be 2 of the heavy hitters that would make up large chunks of a potential crypto based index fund. I’d exclude any tether or USD coin from the top 10 which would give you BNB, XRP, Cardano, Doge, Polygon (Matic), Solana, Polkadot, and Litecoin. Seems like some ideas for ETFs have included Bitcoin miners but those seem to be hit or miss in bull/bear markets. Are we going to get to a point where 99% of the alt coins go to near zero while the money flows into the largest coins (similar to what we’re seeing with cash flowing out of small/regional banks and into the big 3 or 4)? 

Having a formalized index fund through Fidelity or Vanguard that allows direct exposure to crypto coins would legitimize the investment for people who may still be sidelined from wanting to expose themselves to such a seemingly volatile sector. I know I’d love it personally just to be able to divert some of my 401k into a crypto vehicle for the long haul.

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future.

I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho  but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm.

These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. 

Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget.

What is Market Cap? And How To Use it For Analysis (Explained For n00bs),"In summary, **market cap** is the product of the **price** and the **circulating supply** of a coin.

In other words, it's a measure that shows how large a project is.

It's not a specific term for crypto and it's commonly used in traditional markets as well, such as stocks. Let's use a hypothetical company X for example:

* The price per share is $5
* There are 1,000,000 shares outstanding
* The market cap is the price \* the shares = $5M

# Finding the Market Caps for Coins

The best places to find the market capitalizations (market caps in short) for crypto projects are:

1. CoinMarketCap
2. CoinGecko

Just type in your project of choice and take a look.

Here's an example for Bitcoin:

https://preview.redd.it/yp7g2vl3m1wa1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ef05af954c30b4b2acea8a039a4ad343dbabf40

As you can see above the chart, there are the relevant fields:

* **The market cap -** how big is the project currently, expressed in USD
* **The ""fully diluted"" market cap -** how big would the project be if all units are in circulation (remember, there is still Bitcoin that will be mined, so we don't count those in the market cap)
* **Volume -** how much BTC was traded in the last 24h, expressed in USD
* **Circulating supply -** how many BTC are in circulation at this particular moment. As you can see, currently we have 19,355,918BTC out of the 21M that will ever exist.

The **market cap** is the reason why Bitcoin is #1 largest project.

Not the price.

You can find the same information for stocks on Yahoo Finance.

# A Common Misconception (You Probably Have)

A common bad habit many people have is looking only at the price.

I'm referring to thinking that a coin can 1000x because its price is under $1.

**This is incorrect.**

To see the potential of a coin, you have to look at the **price**, but also at the **market cap** and the **circulating supply**.

Many already understand why, but I'll give an example.

# Analysis of a Hypothetical Coin: X INU

Let's say there's a new meme coin called **X INU**. Its current price is $0.001.

Before going all in thinking *""If it hits just $1, I'll make a 1000x!!1""*, check whether it's possible for it to do such a multiple.

You take a look at the market cap, and you see that it's **$100M** (i.e. there are 100,000,000,000 tokens in circulation).

Now, what's the possibility of **X INU** doing a 1000x? Well, that would mean that the market cap would become **$100B**.

Is it realistic to expect that the market will value a meme coin at 100 billion dollars?

Let's check what the market says:

# Comparing to Market Caps of Similar Projects

We know that **X INU** has a market cap of $100M.

The largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $10B, rounded down.

So:

* If X INU overtakes DOGE, it will do a 100x.
* If X INU overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If X INU reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, in the highly unlikely scenario that this new meme coin jumps to one of the top positions per market cap, it will be **just a 100x**.

And I'm saying ""just"" because the n00bs' dreams of retiring after throwing their life savings of $17 in a meme coin disappear after reading this.

Basically, if you see that a coin already has a $100M market cap, you might expect a 2-3x if the conditions are great, but you're not even getting a lambo nor retiring early with such a project.

# TLDR

**A $100M market cap meme coin won't do a 1000x.**

If it were to, we would see it right next to DOGE, among these titans:

Floki Inu’s Listing Skyrockets Price,"
After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048.


The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday.

The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm.

Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings.

FLOKI’s listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US’ large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project’s next goal.
After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project’s team and backers. The coin’s market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('50% up after the listing', 1), ('As usual listing on big exchanges results in pumps .

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 6 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and again in 2023. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **XRP** wins March, followed by **BTC**.  **B****NB** in overall lead (by far) followed distantly by **Ethereum****.** 
* ***2020 Top Ten is best performing of the six Experiments (+388%)***
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +108% vs. 25% if invested same amount and frequency with S&amp;P500** 

## Month Thirty-Nine – UP 388%

https://preview.redd.it/zf1raxcjg2wa1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=786a79be9c32be491ff426027c560d7f4a21efb4

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

March highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **XRP** wins March, followed by **BTC.**
* **BNB** is in the overall lead, by far, followed by **ETH**.
* The 2020 Portfolio is the best performing of the six Top Ten portfolios, up +388%.

This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the **+388%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Binance Coin** and/or **Ethereum** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  

## March Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/q42kl9ykg2wa1.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c13df7bbd8979ee2e74eff902dc3bcdaa09d8f

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after thirty-nine months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **DOGE, MATIC, SOL,** and **USDC.**

At #66, **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

## March Winners and Losers 

***March Winners*** – **XRP** easily outperformed the field, up +34% this month. Second place was **BTC**, +19%.

***March Losers*** – The forks had a bad month: both **BSV** (-14%) and **BCH** (-7%) underperformed their Top Ten peers this month.

## Overall Update – BNB in first place, nearly doubling the ROI of second place ETH. Majority of cryptos are in positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is best performing Portfolio.

At +388%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the six [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 60% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, **BSV, BCH, Tezos,** and **EOS** the exceptions. 

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a dominating lead, followed distantly by **ETH.**

The initial $100 investment thirty-nine months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$2,253**, an increase of +2,152%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +1,311%.

**BSV** is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -64% since January 2020.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/lbsg64img2wa1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e6929c0e2c0e15c063acc2a72bfb36944cf1e6

As a sector, crypto is up **+523%** over the thirty-nine month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+523%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+388%) and ridiculously better than the S&amp;P (+27%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&amp;P below. 

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020** **(aka Zombie Apocalypse).**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) 

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  [**$2.6T in October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/k04s1qzng2wa1.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abe9d33990dc2d9e61cc1b210cf18daf584db676

**BitDom** ended March at 46.4% and has seen a steep rise over the last few months.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hzxu934pg2wa1.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48a0477ec71b26c95a35b49d5dbfbd72dd1047bd

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$4,883** (+388%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the six Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/mx997u9qg2wa1.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d78c3baa4db4aeb65c2c704fe3afb5a472055f2f

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -35% (total value $646)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +228% (total value $3,284)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +388% (total value $4,883) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +94% (total value $1,937)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $313) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +40% (total value $1,402)

So overall? Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After six annual $1k investments ($6,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth**$12,465.**

**That’s up +108%** on the combined portfolios, **down from a +533%** [**November 2021 all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23) for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/sfgp0n8tg2wa1.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a982fa62adcb3c3f7c816252e8c49836bad7479

In summary: ***That’s a +108% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/ngyu8bnug2wa1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b927a7431a43e49c6b77e27494c0b9799b091d0d

Since the S&amp;P 500 has returned +27% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,270 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+388%**, worth **$4,883.**

**That’s a difference of $3,613 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,540 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,070 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,470.**

That is up **+25%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+108%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined five year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

## Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2023 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  March’s extended report covers the one you’re reading here, the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39).

Will Doge really go to the moon?,"Since we all know that dogecoin is getting backed by Elon Musk and people also want him to accept payment in dogecoin for his Tesla cars. And since his single tweet can give a boost to the price of dogecoin, what do you think?

Does Elon really take doge to the moon?

The majority of people are believing that Elon will do something and Dogecoin will hit $1 by this year. What do you think guys? Will tesla accept dogecoin as a payment? And the chances are high that other merchants do accept dogecoin as a payment.

Do you think the future of Doge is tied to what happens with Elon?,"This topic is an idea I thought might be fun to discuss regardless of if you think Doge is the best thing since sliced bread or the worst thing to happen to crypto. 

Doge has had a strange trajectory and while it has down slid from the top 5 cryptos, it is still in the top 10 as of this post anyway.

I started to theorize that Elons messy dealings like he's been having with Twitter may have some tie to Doges relatively dwindled popularity.

So that's made me wonder if say for example Twitter went bankrupt, does that effect Doge or does the crypto/meme community not care.

To be clear this thread isn't praising anyone or any crypto just kind of a market speculation curiosity,  considering doge still ranks up there.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far. The risks in terms of centralization and potential sell offs created by that are obvious.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Need some Anti-Hopium to prevent FOMO,"

Portfolio input,"
Looking for some honest feedback and/or criticism on my portfolio. No pissing match here, just want to make sure I’m setup for success over the next 2 years. I don’t have false hopes of being a multimillionaire overnight, but I want to capitalize the next bullrun as much as possible. Nobody knows me here so I don’t care about sharing rough figures. Right now I have roughly 55k invested. Also full disclosure, my figures below won’t represent what I currently have locked in Celsius due to chapter 11. Not sure how much of that I’ll get back, but hopefully a decent amount once that nightmare wraps up.  Out of the coins I have full access to at the moment this is the rough breakdown:
BTC: 62%
DOT: 12%
LINK: 8%
VET: 4%
AUDIO: 3%
NEAR, HBAR, SAND, DAI: each ~2%
DOGE, SHIB, FIL: each ~1%

Locked on Celsius I have another .25 btc, about 8 ETH, and a good amount of stables I intended to buy the bottom of the market with (thanks a lot Mashinsky). Obviously if I added that to my available portfolio, the percentages of everything will be adjusted. As of right now, I’m considering it a loss until we are out of ch.11.

Every month from now until the halving I plan to add an extra 1-2k to continue to DCA. Once the halving hits I’ll likely sit on my hands for a year. With that additional money I plan to purchase new coins as well as strengthen my positions in some of the lower cap coins on my list. Coins I plan to add are: THETA, XRP, ADA, FET, MATIC, SOL, QNT, BAND. I’d like to knock my btc exposure down to 40-50% by time I’m done.

I know my portfolio is not loaded with coins that have 50 X potential. I’m looking for growth, but I’m also looking for safety. I don’t really want shit coins that have tremendous risk (I understand risk is relative in this sector). I don’t mind throwing a grand or two in something as a YOLO play, but I want majority of my pics to be blue chip, or at least in the top 25 or so coins. Im a big fan of passive income so I love stakable coins. That’s essentially the reason DOT is currently my #2 holding. 

I’m not going to fall for your scams, so don’t bother messaging me. I won’t reply to private messages.
Thanks in advance for any input",1,0,2023-04-26 16:12:14,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE,"[('Hello, your post was removed because your account is less than 60 days old or you do not have the required 500 **comment** karma to make post submissions.', 1)]"
My crypto investments is my healthiest investment that I've ever made!,"Here's my personal story about crypto:

Before I knew about crypto (or investing at all!) I used to spend the few money I had left for smoking.

I did not see any financial difference if I would kept the fiat (which inflates in such high rates in my country) saved or if I would buy cigarettes and literally put all these money into smoke.

Then I've heard about DOGE back in 2021, I wanted to get some profits, too. But I didn't have money to invest, so I've thought.

The only money I could afford to lose was my smoking money.

So I've stopped smoking (believe me, the first months were hard to withstand) to invest in crypto.

It's would be an own story to tell you how my crypto investments went (spoiler: I am in a total loss, monetary wise), but my belief that crypto will one day enter a bullmarket again kept me going on.

While I cannot say that I've made profits with crypto in terms of ""money gains"", but I made health gains!!!

Investing in crypto means for me, investing in myself, in my health and in my financial future.

Why Moons will never be Top100,"So basically I’ve seen a lot bullish but quite delusional opinions regarding Moons, as a currency and its potential outcome. Here is my totally bearish opinion on Moons.


# Why am I posting this ?

A lot of people are talking about seeing Moons in the Top 100, 50 even higher sometimes. So let’s get it straight, I ***do not*** believe this will ever happen. You’ll hear that some shitcoins went parabolic in a few days with less holders and this could send Moons to $100 if it *simply* matched Doge’s Market Cap or something. This is utter madness and not only delusional but showing a true lack of education about the whole ecosystem (*In my opinion*)


# Quick reminder on Moons

To make it clear, I must remind you that technically Moons are not supposed to be traded. Also, according to Reddit ToS, Moons are meant to be solely a Governance Token without monetary value. While I totally understand this is a legal stand to prevent any juridic inconvenience, people need to understand that by no means Reddit will support trading, listings or anything related to the fact people can take this governance token out of his way.

This is a free market, people are able to trade it and price reflects simply the offer / demand for it. I still don’t understand why anyone would want to buy Moons, but I’ll get back to it later.


# Not your everyday shitcoin

Now let me explain why I can’t see a lucrative future for Moons holders. First, while it *is* a shitcoin, Moons can’t be compared to others with aggressive marketing campaigns like Shiba did with Vitalik, or Doge being directly pumped by Musk. 

You can find every example in the world, Moons have no reason to get pumped simply because they are not *meant* for it. You may then ask why shitcoins like BabyMuskCumBucket on the BSC will pump eventually : because this is their only purpose and people play the greater fool game trying to get in early and get out on time.


# No one cares

Another interesting stat : there are 6+ million people in this sub, interested in cryptos and for sure knowing about Moons, but we are not even 200K holders. This means barely 3% of the “biggest crypto community” care about Moons that are ***free***. So now tell me how someone out of this sub would care more, having to ***buy*** them.


# Holder repartition is a Red Flag

My last point is that *even if* Moons were to magically pump one day, considering the distribution of wallets, there are already too much Moon whales to maintain a healthy bullrun. As soon as it would break ATH or say reach the scandalous value of $1, most whales will dump their bags and empty out liquidities everywhere. Most liquidity providers would face IL and I bet even arbitrage bots, if there’s any focusing on Moons, wouldn’t help.

On a side note, KM is only creating artificial scarcity, thus making price moves after snapshot and distribution. It is not needed for the governance use of the token and actually penalize liquidity providers. It has been voted by whales to secure their bag and make sure most people are incentivized to hold while they can dump at anytime.


# Usecase &gt; Pump

Moons value is bound to the fact it is inflationary and airdropped every month. What would be the intencive for buyers ? Why would they throw cash at it if most of the supply is owned by people who had it for free ?

As a final word, I think a pump on Moons value would do more harm than good, and it needs to keep a stable value to best serve it’s very purpose : governance.

Poor folks getting rich in crypto? Myth vs. reality possibility vs. probability?,"We’ve all heard the Otis Spunkmire story about those delicious cookies that took Otis from homelessness and poverty to a wealthy household name and the story of the American dream.  The tales of sudden  

Bitcoin millionaires and lost treasures in long forgotten wallets flood the crypto ethos like urban legends and bring new blood, and new funds to the space daily.  Like miners panning for gold people from all walks of life flood the crypto space and provide fuel for market and make great targets for the well equipped scammer and the next rug pull. 

Like walking into a casino after having  read one book on how to play poker, then getting eyes drawn to the new high tech slot machines individuals are quickly reminded of P.T. Barnum’s quote, “there’s a sucker born every minute,” as they attempt to explain to their families where the Christmas bonus went. 

Dejected and dismayed they vow unwittingly to get the money back and then some. After all they’ve heard Pepe is the new Doge and the old Doge is about to do it again. All they need to do is swap they current bags and Hodl and in time they’ll moon,  right? Or at least that’s what the latest YouTube guru says as they point out “life changing gains.” 

Is it real? I’m of the belief that 90% or more of the recognized “outliers” have had way more going for them besides a dollar and a dream. Things like exposure to market, ability to read charts, above average financial literacy and a decent financial cushion certainly have allot to do with so called “overnight successes.” Rags to riches stories are enticing however. How many have hodled while they watched their dream come true then crash into oblivion? Sucked in by community hype and under the illusion that the superior tech was going to take their coin to the next level those who don’t know what volatility really means are destined to find out.
There’s a learning curve to anything worthwhile. Education is rarely free. It demands to be paid for one way or the other. Exchange fees, transfer fees, gas fees, transaction, fees, and taxes take the poor man for a ride, and by the time all is said, and done how much better off were they?

We aren't doing enough to help promote moons as a community(and how we can change that),"Now we all know how much hype is important for the growth of a crypto project, and yet all we do here is shill them to ourselves, creating a big echo chamber while making it unlikely for the entire internet to hear about our token.

I think one of the strongest points about our token is the size of the community, but unlike other shitcoin communities, we don't really spread the word about ours anywhere we go.

For example, I have seen some of my irl friends have doge as their profile pic on facebook, I've personally worked as a writer for a community shiba inu website where they try to promote shib for the internet, and so on and so forth..

Also, I saw many people on reddit recruiting meme posters on 4chan about crypto projects, and some even  recruit ""guerilla marketers"" , who try and push certain coins without making it obvious in crypto subs like this one. The thing is , we can do all this to help push our token and grow its adoption. 

Try to mention moons on crypto twitter like all shitcoin degens do. If you're a 4chan user let them know about your x10 play (moons). It isn't really unethical because I'm pretty sure moons are more of a solid investment han the DogeElonCum kind of tokens shilled around there.

"I want some sound, logical, reasonable, technical, and factually backed Bitcoin fud - where should I look?","It's hard to find it here cuz most have made up their minds for/against Bitcoin already, and the majority of posts lately are Marco reposts or comedy flairs for the moon farmer's market stand.

The Bitcoin sub is too bullishly cracked on memes and the Buttcoin sub is an echo chamber of ragers who missed the bottom.

I don't want philosophical or moral or conceptual or dollar to zero stuff. I want to know the technical limitations Bitcoin currently has in achieving what all the bulls say it will someday achieve.

Some examples of what I want to dive more into:

Bear : tps too low
Bull: lightning network
Bear: opening/maintaining channels is weird/difficult because of xyz

Bear: halvings eventually won't reward miners
Bull: fees will generate mining revenue 
Bear: exorbitant fees on a deflationary asset will further discourage transactions volume and monetary velocity meaning less revenue to secure the pow network and perhaps less economic gdp.

Bear: privacy?
Bull: mixers and utxo w/ diff addresses
Bear: govs eventually sanctioning protocols potentially used for tax evasion or money laundering which may lead to cutting off fiat on-ramps for wallet addresses that have interacted with such protocols.

It's my understanding that Bitcoin set out to replace fiat currency and become the ultimate store of value. If it can't outdo the current tps for the modern digital economy, can't maintain a stable store of value with its speculative volatility, and may or may not have its security compromised with the lack of capitalist incentives in a non decentralized mining environment down the road (like 1-4 major miners cherry picking what makes it into each block), how will it ever achieve anything more than it already has? Will it forever be an open infrastructure with a hodl strategy peddled by speculative and euphoric OGs, shills, and cultists? 

I like the idea of Bitcoin as well as the philosophy behind it, but there's a long road between 1BTC = $X? and 1BTC=1BTC and I don't yet know enough to not talk out of my a$$ so I want to know what technical arguments may be holding it back and could forever keep it in the speculative, quasi religious sector of the crypto asset class. 

Even tho the idea of a decentralized, unhackable network providing a medium of exchange for value transfer sounds and is amazing, I'm not quite sold that Bitcoin, being the first answer, is the final and best answer. Bitcoiners like to think they picked the next world reserve currency but doge coin, shib, and xmr folks think that too which is why I've been leaning away from crypto as a CURRENCY and have been focusing on token projects providing infrastructure, utility and interoperability with today's economy.

Anywho it would be great if someone could plz point me to the ultimate Bitcoin fud post/comment/subreddit so I can weigh the bull case against an educated bear case.

Reality is a perception! -Elon Musk influence!!,"

I've been in crypto for a while. I've seen many things ,but beyond all I was amazed by the fact how can a single man influence an entire industry,so this question occupied my mind all the time. How can Elon musk have such a big influence on crypto market, i did some research i looked some of his popular tweets and the charts, what i found out changed my way of thinking forever,i will never look at the world the same way i did especially financial markets.
On Apr-May 2021 Elon made a move on doge coin the markets started crashing, at the meantime i had a analyse of btcusdt with some basic concepts like market structure and wyckoff distribution scheme,eventually i was correct on the analysis,and the volume divergences indicated that the market will fall rapidly.

Sooooooo???

What if Elon doesn't influence the markets,he just knows the markets ,at least he has some good proffesional guys who knows the markets,everything is about timing,he knows there is a high probability that the markets will fall,he posts something about it to make it look like he is the captain and he makes the ship sink. With this move everybody will think he has influence in cryptomarkets, increasing his overall reputation ,benefiting him in other areas.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.


Is this evil??? 

Non at all.He is definitely manipulating everybody,but at least he gives   people a clue where the markets are going,since he can't give financial advice publicly, he does it in a indirect way, he acts like a strong indicator to crypto investors community with a high probability of being a good financial advice.

Why cryptocurrency will never be better than fiat (opinion),"First and foremost I am a meme stock trader, and I have so much Doge it hurts. So I want to make sure yall understand the level of legitimacy of which my stock/crypto/asset portfolibro exists.

Now this is all in light hearted fun folks.  I like both fiat and crypto.  But what happens if the internet goes down?  What happens if a country's bitcoin mining facilities get blown up during a war?  What if I can't access my Doge???

Now I'm not saying banks are going to screw us over anyway lol what I'm saying is: at least for now, if the internet went down, I could go and withdraw fiat money.  Or, if you're a silly goose like me and hide cash underneath the uh....I mean.....nevermind.....

This is of course an open discussion.  I would love more insight from those of you who actually know what you're talking about.

Also I want to recognize how crypto is definitely worth it in the long run for stability, transferring funds super quick, etc.  Not trying to shill out in crypto.  Just sparking some discussion.

**Technical Overview:**

The Warp Drive dApp achieves seamless orchestration between the blockchain, mid-journey interactions, and OpenAI's ChatGPT. By connecting these technologies, we provide a unique and immersive experience for NFT holders.

Some highlights of the Warp Drive implementation include the following:

* Smart contract integration for NFT metadata and ownership management.
* AI-powered image analysis and generation using OpenAI's ChatGPT.
* Mid-journey interactions that enhance the storytelling experience.

The code for the Warp Drive dApp is open-source and available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Ataxia123/WarpDrive](https://github.com/Ataxia123/WarpDrive)  Feel free to take a look and contribute if you're interested!

As a creator, I aimed to develop a unique and immersive storytelling experience beyond owning an NFT. By joining the Infinite Universe Alliance and using the Warp Drive, you can dive into a captivating universe and make your own mark in the Infinite Universe.

"Need 20x by 2025, what are your thoughts?","Started with $50k last month.  Portfolio breakdown is:

50% BTC
10% ETH
20% DOGE
10% SOL
10% PEPE

Rate my portfolio, what would you add? Going to be DCA another $10k or so over the next 3-6 months.  Would you expect a 20x overall return by 2025 even if one of these goes bust? I feel like 20x would be conservative and would hope for closer to 50x.  If that’s the case should I reallocate or just start investing in more alt coins throughout the year

Should I also scrap BTC because realistically from here we will probably only see a 3x

Was Mike Novogratz of Luna tattoo fame a guest Lecturer for Gary at MIT?,"A couple of years ago, while on Bloomberg Mike Novogratz name-dropped his old buddy Gary Gensler [he worked at Goldman with](https://twitter.com/LitecoinMag/status/1475288658194411524), and their connections, claiming (around 2m35s) that he was a guest lecturer for Gary at MIT.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GTj\_ciethI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GTj_ciethI)

[Apparently one of the lectures, number 18, is missing and unseen](https://twitter.com/ZK_shark/status/1651316973832228865). I haven't noticed Mike lecturing in any of the old Gensler videos I've seen, so I wonder if perhaps it's this one, seemingly taken down for some reason. The search for this number 18 continues.

I find this interesting as big fines hit celebrities and influencers for pitching unregistered securities. Many of these are people with little to no financial expertise, whose jobs are looking good, being tough or goofing off, being held to a pretty high standard by regulators. Meanwhile here's a wall street veteran running a publicly traded financial services business with, at a glance on google, what appears to be nearly $2 billion AUM, who is constantly going on international financial television and not only pitching things like EOS, LUNA and SOL, but I remember back in the day his main and sometimes only argument for EOS was Block One's $4 billion warchest.

He was explicitly favoring coins FOR their centralization, which is precisely the thing most likely to get it flagged as a security. I remember when he suddenly got quiet about EOS, after it became clear blockone wasn't going to use that warchest to help it much, and also at the same time it got a decent number of users playing blockchain games on it. I.E., once it decentralized at least a little, he wanted nothing to do with it anymore.

Did Mike Novogratz receive preferential allocations never available to the public from the progenitors of these centralized chains? In the dozens of interviews of him I've seen, I never saw him asked. Not his buy price, not where his stops were so that when they dumped, he wouldn't hurt like the muggles he was pitching these projects to. [Meanwhile actual journalists were begging stations not to feature Mike, because they knew his scam](https://twitter.com/laurasgoldman/status/1591560432715976704). And yet, no fines like the bobble headed celebs got.

In a rational world you'd expect the financial expert and veteran to be held to a higher standard than the pretty celebrities. One thing is for sure, any special treatment mikey gets is NOT related to his friendship with regulators. I just want to make that clear. Take your tinfoil hat off.

Interesting too are the projects Novogratz shorts. Love or hate Dogecoin, joke or not, it's at the very least a maximally decentralized joke. He openly claims to short it in the video at the top of the post. Novogratz has also ranted many times especially since 2019 about Litecoin, and contacted the community donation funded litecoin foundation then looking to either borrow coins from them or for names of litecoin whales he could borrow from off book (so it wouldn't show up on public order books) and shortly thereafter, once they explained they were a poor org working for donations not instafunded from massive premines like the foundations Mike is used to, and that they obviously wouldn't help him even if they had coins, he tweets out at a strategic moment in litecoin's last halving rally that it makes no sense and everyone should sell ltc. Gee, I wonder if he was short.

When his long strategy started to waver (and coincidentally, just as LTC was starting to outperform, I suspect he had a long ethkiller, short ltc/doge strategy), he went on CNBC to demand they take Litecoin off their price chart and replace it with one of his projects, specifically naming SOL and LUNA. [They complied, for a while at least](https://twitter.com/LitecoinMag/status/1475288658194411524).

Why short those? Precisely because there are no preferential allocations for guys like him to get early access to. They're legitimately decentralized chains where every coin went to secure the network, and thus wasn't available to hand out to hedgies. He can't even compete on even ground with poor randos like you and me despite the massive pile of cash he has and the ability to hire researchers and buy supercomputer time and privileged access to leverage and capital. He needs an extra guaranteed edge. Centralized chains that instantly mint massive percentages of their coins to hand out to insiders and wall street pushers are very distinct from Bitcoin and it's closest cousins. And while Bitcoin is too big for mike to push around, he has the resources to attack doge and ltc. At least for a while.

TL;DR Why does it all matter? Everyone knows they're all corrupt, can't do anything about it. Maybe not. But sunlight ought to fall on these guys from time to time. Maybe at an absolute minimum someone here will remember who Novogratz is and not fall for his next dozen centralized garbage chains when he's pitching them with the help of friendly anchors on bloomberg, cnbc and yfi.",0,11,2023-04-27 22:46:01,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('Hello noduhcache.

Doge coin. Is it possible to hit 1 dollar?,,1,0,2023-04-28 07:36:39,,CryptoCurrency,MARKETS,[]
Here are the potential prices Moons could reach!,"Have you ever wondered if Moons could moon? 

Well, it's possible and very likely to happen! Moons have a low market cap, which means that they still have a lot of space to grow even more!  
Here are the prices moons could reach if they had the same market cap as other big cryptocurrencies:

# MONERO:

If moons had the same market cap as monero, they would be worth around **$26.40**! That's a **118x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# SHIB:

If moons had the same market cap as shib, they would be worth around **$56.72**! That's a **256x** increase in its price!

&amp;#x200B;

# SOLANA: 

If moons had the same market cap as SOL, they would be worth **$84.36**! That would be a **381x** price increase for moons!

&amp;#x200B;

# DOGECOIN:

If moons had the same market cap as DOGE, they would be worth approximately **$104.45**! That is a **472x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

Before heading to the top 3 market caps (excluding stable coins), here are some honorable mentions:

**Avalanche: $53.56**

**Litecoin: $60.91**

**Matic: $86.30**

**Cardano: $132.56**

**XRP: $228.79**

The honorable mentions list is over, now let's head to the top 3!

&amp;#x200B;

# BNB:

If Moons had the same market cap as BNB, they would be worth an amazing **$477.24!** That would be a 2158x price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# ETHEREUM:

If Moons had the same market cap as ETH, they would be worth a spectacular **$2,134.43**! That's a HUGE price increase, giving Moons a **9655x** price increase!

&amp;#x200B;

# BITCOIN:

Anyone think 90-96% of the time it's the whales who make bank?,"A lot of people enter crypto as a potential way to make big money and don't get me wrong, that is clearly still possible. With the right long term hold you never know- if you have an early equivalent like something like Google or Microsoft used to be, you could technically be early enough on something for big rises in the future. 📈

That said there are no guarantees like with most things. But I imagine historically it is usually the whales who walk away laughing with big blobs of money.

To add to that I think a lot of times they may be what's manipulating the market- including even regular stocks. 👕

To give the most simple analogy-

This fat whale put 10 million dollars into doge or bitcoin- the market gets excited- over a number of days, weeks or months depending on market conditions, people start to poor money, especially shrimps like many of us and the next thing you know the market dipped like a volcano while the 🐋  walk away happy with literally 10's or 100's of thousands dollars in easy profit while many of us feel bad about the few hundred or thousands of dollars we have in crypto 🤣

DOGE Creator Drops Approving Comment on New Netflix Crypto TV Series 'Beef',,1,0,2023-04-29 11:21:53,,CryptoCurrency,LEGACY,[]
"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each with a short explanation (04/2023)","I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) post of 2 years ago and thought it would be interesting to update this for the situation today.

After 2 years, 66% of the currencies in the list are still there. Somtimes in a different order of course. I believe this is quite a lot in a volatile market as crypto with many scams going around.

&amp;#x200B;

* Obvious disappearances from the list include: Terra (LUNA), FTX Token (FTT) and Celsius (CEL).
* Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC).
* The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving.  


As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment!  


&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now…
4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
5. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
6. Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. Cardano (ADA): another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
8. Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon!
9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues.
10. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
11. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
12. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
13. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance (created by Paxos), tied to USD, for now
14. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
15. Shiba Inu (SHIB): also dubbed ""Dogecoin killer"", basically the little meme brother
16. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
17. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
18. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
19. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
20. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
21. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
22. Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
23. OKB (OKB): the native token of OKEx exchange.
24. Monero (XMR): if you need drugs (jokes aside, it's a coin focussed on privacy)
25. Ethereum Classic (ETC): technically the original Ethereum network
26. Internet Computer (ICP): blockchain network that aims to provide a decentralized version of cloud computing
27. Toncoin (TON): formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network.
28. Stellar (XLM): fast processing times and low fees
29. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability
30. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
31. Aptos (APT): A privacy-focused cryptocurrency, dubbed as ""Solana Killer"", many red flags were mentioned though
32. TrueUSD (TUSD): another stablecoin
33. Cronos (CRO): the native token of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange
34. Hedera (HBAR): a public distributed ledger that uses a hashgraph consensus algorithm
35. Lido DAO (LDO): a decentralized finance protocol that enables staking of Ethereum 2.0
36. Arbitrum (ARB): a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions (for MOONS!)
37. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): yet another blockchain platform that aims to enable decentralized applications with low fees and high performance
38. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
39. ApeCoin (APE): a decentralized finance project (if you like bananas, try Banano instead)
40. Quant (QNT): a blockchain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks.
41. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
42. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
43. Fantom (FTM): blockchain platform that enables fast and cheap transactions
44. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
45. The Sandbox (SAND): a blockchain-based virtual world, fading into the ""sands"" of time
46. MultiversX (EGLD): Previously known as ""ELROND"". Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
47. Decentraland (MANA): A virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain
48. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
49. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
50. Stacks (STX): a blockchain platform that enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Bitcoin network.",9,22,2023-04-29 12:14:17,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it’s not a reliable “get rich quick” scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. 

Solana is currently worth $23.61/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021.

SAND wasn’t even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021.

Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested.

I know you can’t predict this stuff, but I think it’s still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there’s always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw.

I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off.

I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. 

Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it’s now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021.

Obviously it’s much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL’ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE).

Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. 

I’m not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I’m aware that it’s more like gambling, and not a reliable way to “get rich quick”.

I’m just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to “shoot to the moon”, and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they’re unavailable on CoinBase.

I couldn’t even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren’t allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won’t allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it’s perfectly fine in other risky investments).

You can’t tell me ALL these “big winners” are PURELY blind luck……

And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don’t allow a lot outside of well established coins…..",27,290,2023-04-30 08:45:48,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Hello cryptdoh6.

Thoughts on keeping meme coins on exchanges,"So lately we have all seen how important is to have coins in self custody. And I agree with that.

But I did notice something. 2 times so far when Elon did something connecting Twitter and Dogecoin, DOGE pumped. And I had my DOGE in a hardware wallet tucked away somewhere inconvenient so I prevent myself from impulse selling stuff. I could sell at the spike, there was quite a low chance that the price will remain there. But it would take some time to get my Ledger and send it to exchange and sell it.

So I didn't do it because I am a miserable hodler (with the exception mentioned in my other post).

I realised something. If you own a memecoin, it might be actually smart to keep memecoins such as SHIB and DOGE on exchange in order to react to those ridiculus spikes. At least to take advantage, sell and maybe later buy more at lower price, ergo accumulating said coin.

So you wanna say: ""What if the exchange goes to shit and I lose my funds?""

First of all: You have to be a special degenerate and gambler to have a high percentage of your portfolio in memecoins.

Second: If you do have a large amount in meme coins, that would mostly mean you also have a lot of money already to be playing around with it like that so I guess a potential loss like that wouldnt change your life for the worse.l

Dragon Ball Z Meets Crypto: Comparing top Cryptocurrencies to DBZ Characters,"Inspired by [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/134141d/lets\_play\_a\_game\_which\_anime\_character/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/134141d/lets_play_a_game_which_anime_character/) I decided to make my own list of some of the top cryptos and how they match DBZ characters.

https://preview.redd.it/nlwcnpzaa7xa1.png?width=2480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c37d6ad00167d9ce9fc594e4a154ff3a76797f17

1. **Bitcoin (BTC) - Goku:** Just like Goku, Bitcoin is the strongest and most powerful crypto currency in the world. It has survived multiple attacks and has proven to be extremely resilient.
2. **Ethereum (ETH) - Vegeta:** Like Vegeta, Ethereum is the second strongest crypto currency in the world. It's constantly striving to be the best and improve itself, even if it means taking risks.
3. **Binance Coin (BNB) - Piccolo:** Piccolo is a powerful and reliable ally to the Z fighters, just like Binance Coin is a reliable cryptocurrency for traders and investors.
4. **Dogecoin (DOGE) - Hercule:** Hercule is a lovable but often underestimated character in the DBZ universe, just like Dogecoin is a meme-based crypto currency that people initially thought was a joke but has since gained a following.
5. **Cardano (ADA) - Gohan:** Gohan starts off as a timid character but grows into a strong and powerful fighter, just like Cardano is a relatively new crypto currency that has shown great potential.
6. **XRP (XRP) - Frieza:** Frieza is a powerful villain in the DBZ universe, just like XRP has been embroiled in controversies and legal battles.
7. **Polkadot (DOT) - Android 17:** Android 17 is a powerful and versatile fighter who can adapt to any situation, just like Polkadot is a platform that can connect multiple blockchains.
8. **Internet Computer (ICP) - Cell:** Cell is a powerful but unpredictable villain in the DBZ universe, just like the Internet Computer is a new and innovative crypto currency that has yet to prove itself.
9. **Solana (SOL) - Future Trunks:** Future Trunks is a character from a dystopian future who comes to the present to prevent disaster, just like Solana is a crypto currency that aims to solve scalability issues.
10. **Chainlink (LINK) - Krillin:** Krillin is a reliable ally to the Z fighters and is known for his resourcefulness, just like Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable data to smart contracts.

Crypto disappoints me greatly with meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even.

I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with. I think it makes the space look immature and basically slows adoption by directing focus onto such nonsense. Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing.

If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso. And I really know deep in my heart a rug is coming, either that or they just suck the life out of it as more liquidity replaces the old suckers. If you want to contribute to something like this, you are the reason we are laughed at as a community. They don't see the good projects in the mainstream, only the jokes. And this is one of the biggest jokes yet, same as any meme coin before it. If you want to actively work against the community as a whole, what better way than to support this crap. Downvote me all you want I'm just sick of these shitty meme coins dominating the news when we should be focusing on more important matters, like the fucking recession coming. But hey let's just get distracted by a fucking frog right?

It needs 1 bull market and 1 bear market to learn the ropes,"Crypto was a trial and error story for me.

I was aware of crypto since 2017, but crypto and even financials doesn't interest me.

This changed 2021 with the mem coin hype around DOGE and the bullmarket back then.

It caught my attention, I wanted to profit like all those tubers and influencers did and started ~~investing~~ gambling into crypto. Why I say gambling? Because I had zero knowledge what crypto is or what it is about. **Zero**.

My trials and errors included falling victim to pump&amp;dumps, rugpulls, hacks, wrong transactions, paying insane gas fees, paying insane gas fees twice (...because signing this and confirming that or putting too low gas fee so tx doesn't go through...), buying the tops and buying into dipping dips, FOMO.

But the most important lesson, I've learnt in the bear market...DYOR, steady investment, keeping emotions out of it.

I'm not saying that I am an expert now, still learning. The next lesson I hope I can master (and hoping that I will be able to) is **to actually take profits** in a bullmarket.

"Is the COLLECTIBLE side of NFTs market getting a little delusional? Can peak hype and ATHs be reached again? Here's why it may no longer reach those highs, even with a crypto bull market, and why the NFT collectible market is still struggling despite the crypto rally.","# Intro.

While  I think NFTs have some potential in some areas like ticketing, I'm  talking here about the collectible side, where you have a JPG attached  to it, and trade them like Pokemon cards.

The NFT collectible market has been spiraling down, with value plummeting.

Its  own bull market and hype train was actually pretty brief, spiked  quickly, and then months later people were already struggling with even  the hot collections.

But a lot of  people have said ""Don't worry, it will bounce back"", ""we will get back  to ATH, just like Bitcoin"",  ""once crypto exits its bear market, we're  gonna start seeing huge spiked in NFT sales"".

I'm starting to really doubt it, and maybe even see some delusion in that line of thinking.

We've had more than 3 months of cryptocurrency rally, and still no sign of the NFT market stopping its downfall.

&amp;#x200B;

# Misunderstanding of NFTs as something being able to follow the rest of the crypto market.

There's already a big flaw in that thinking, and in believing it will be just like cruptocurrencies.

That if Bitcoin goes back to ATH, then why not some of the big NFT collections?

NFTs aren't currency.

They're  not fungible, and don't act like a digital currency you can easily  trade like Bitcoin, or use to buy a coffee. NFTs act more like something  you trade on eBay.

You don't go on an exchange like Coinbase to trade them, you go on a marketplace like Opensea.

The dynamics are different, and the market is different.

&amp;#x200B;

# It's already showing signs that it no longer follows the crypto market, and is behaving differently.

I  wouldn't rely too much on the hopes that a crypto bull market will make  many NFT collections go back to their peak prices again.

At  best, the bull market will introduce new collections that will spike  and fall quickly. But it might not necessarily resurrect old ones.

The  big spike in the NFT market happened during the crypto bull market. For  a brief time, it looked like it could be in tandem with the crypto  market.

But it increasingly looked  like it was more of the initial hype coinciding at the time with the  height of the last bull market. But not actually following crypto's  double top. And then the hype quickly fizzled out.

This heavily depended on NFT being a new thing.

Now, we're starting to get a better picture, and are seeing early signs that NFTs can't keep up with the crypto market.

Despite  the crypto market emerging from the bear market, and rallying for the  past few months, NFTs hasn't been able to do the same, and keeps losing  momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

# They depend too much on hype and novelty.

While  it's true that some cryptos, like meme coins like Doge also have a big  dependency on hype, with NFTs it's on a much bigger scale.

With Doge, if the hype dies down, you still have a currency, and you can go spend it at AMC, Newegg, Gamestop, etc...

With  NFTs, if the hype dies down, you are left with a collectible that no  one wants to collect. It's now a paper weight with no weight.

&amp;#x200B;

# The market keeps getting more over saturated.

In the beginning, hype was able to fuel massive price and sales spikes.

It was a brand new type of collectible and a new type of technology. There weren't that many well known collections.

That's  why the big collections like Bored Apes, were able to initially get all  the focus and sales. And be the ""household names"".

But that didn't last.

The  market quickly turned from one collection to the next. And pretty soon,  people started to realize that anyone and their dogs could make their  own collection.

The market became over saturated with one collection after another. And it hasn't stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

# Even stars are struggling to sell their collections now.

When  the market became saturated, and collections struggled to sell, and  prices started to plummet, the ones still able to sell their collections  were stars.

Having a famous name serve as an influencer helped some collections stand out.

But that also didn't last.

Musician Grimes who was Elon Musk girlfriend, also saw her NFT collection drop by 84%.

Snoop Dogg's NFT initially had a floor price of $1.9K, now the floor price dropped to $81.

Collections  from many football (soccer) starts from Paul Pogba to John Terry, have  seen the value of their collection drop 70%-90%.

Even celebrity endorsed collections like Bored Bunny, Trollz,  Rich Dwarves Tribe, all tanked.

Now  celebrities from Paris Hilton to Gwyneth Paltrow, are being sued for  shilling NFTs that all tanked and lost people a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

# What will it take for collectible NFTs to bounce back?

It's  very possible that a crypto market rally won't be enough on its own.  The last few months of Bitcoin rallying hasn't even been able to stop  the NFT market bleeding.

Even the star power is no longer able to lift the NFT market.

The  big spike we saw in 2021, was depending too much on hype, star power,  and collectible NFTs being this new thing. It had the ""new tech"" factor,  which has now mostly faded. And overall, it depended too much on one  thing: being a collectible.

It might be time for a new generation of NFTs to offer something a little more of value, with actual functions and utility.

We've seen how NFTs can be used to download music, enter special events, own something in the real world, etc...

You think the current memecoin frenzy is dumb now? I have a dumb prediction for when the next bull run comes and crazier amounts of dumb money inevitably flow in.,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It’s time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun.

Look, you can scream “scam” and “rugpull” all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market’s euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino.

Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat.

There currently aren’t many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there’s a good chance the next memecoin king doesn’t even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can!

While it’s uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today’s memecoin investors are tomorrow’s BTC and ETH investors.

TRON and SHIBA INU are top 15 coins. How can we take the crypto market seriously like this?,"According to Coinmarketcap TRON sits at spot 13 and SHIBA INU at spot 15.

A fourth coin TREAT is expected to be launched soon. These coins can be purchased by via the ShibaSwap DEX and then staked to earn rewards. An overview has been provided below:\n&gt; \n&gt; * SHIB (Original Coin)\n&gt;    * Large coin supply\n&gt;    * Stake rewards \\[ Earn 3% BONE per block &amp; + 0.3% of all ETH transaction fees\\].\n&gt; * LEASH   (Liquidity provider )\n&gt;    * Limit supply\n&gt;    * Stake rewards  \\[0.5% Bone minted per Block \\]\n&gt;    * Additional rewards (puppy pool)  \\[+ 0.3% WBTC &amp; + 0.3% USDC for all swap transactions\\].\n&gt; * BONE (Governance token)\n&gt;    * Stake Rewards:  \\[1% Bone minted per block \\]\n&gt;    * Additional reward (puppy pool): \\[ +0.3% DAI + 0.3% USDT swap returns.\\]\n&gt; * TREAT (coming soon)\n&gt; \n&gt; ([Source: Shiba Inu whitepaper](https://woofpaper.org/SHIBAINU_Ecosystem_WOOF_Paper.pdf))\n&gt; \n&gt; ## 3.2. Trading benefits\n&gt; \n&gt; SHIBA has a fairly low price, fairly good availability , high trading volume and volatility. This may appeal to traders with a higher appetite for risk.

Buterin then decided to donate $1 billion worth to an Indian corona relief fund, leading the SHIB owners to subsequently claim some disgusting moral victory that this was somehow thanks to SHIB. Meanwhile the coin plummeted in value after this event, leading to losses for whomever sold. To this day the SHIB owners gloat that Buterin is \'a friend of SHIB\' and that \'SHIB led to that amazing donation\', pissing on the graves of all of those who lost money in the wake of that event. Meanwhile they also pretend that the most important thing about SHIB is the community. But apparently the community can go [expletive] themselves if it means the SHIB team can abuse them for some PR stunt.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**The \'top secret\' roadmap**\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, for a coin supposedly centered around it\'s community, the SHIB team speaks of a \'top secret 2021 Ruffmap with a real budget\' that they do not elaborate on. Once more proving that the SHIB team does not care about its community, because if they did this \'Ruffmap\' would not be \'top secret\' but out in the open for the community to know about. It also leads you to wonder if this \'Ruffmap\' is even real or just an empty promise.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Decentralisation issues**\n&gt; \n&gt; Another indicator of SHIB\'s empty speech about community is the [Certik audit page](https://www.certik.org/projects/shib) pointing out that the weakest link of the project is.. decentralisation. Very ironic for a project that starts off and takes pride in being ""an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building"".\n&gt; \n&gt; #**The mysterious team**\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the SHIB team mentioned in this post, they are nothing but a mystery. Or, as the [Coinbureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/shiba-inu\\/) review put it:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I’ve seen no mention of a development team, and the founder of the token “Ryoshi” fully admits in his initial post on Medium that the token wasn’t even rolled by him, but instead was created by a friend who locked half the supply in a Uniswap contract and then sent the rest to Ryoshi’s wallet.\n&gt; \n&gt; One could interpret this in the sense of the SHIB community being the key focus here, but as pointed out above the SHIB team or whoever these mysterious figures are seem to care little about their community, despite their claims.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Technical documentation**\n&gt; \n&gt; ERROR 404, page not found\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Conclusion**\n&gt; \n&gt; At best SHIB is a ship (pardon the pun) that is indeed community based, but left rudderless by the creators. What seems more likely, however, is that it\'s heavily centralised (despite their own claims) and manipulated from behind the curtains by the (probably deliberately) invisible team.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Bonus con: their \'Woofpaper\' PDF literally [won\'t open properly](https://i.imgur.com/jkFNlnD.jpg) in my Adobe PDF reader and the Chrome browser version is laggy.

Eh, odds are against all of us.

Don't ride any coin to zero. I've done it so many times myself.

2-3x? Take your initial. 

Sell portions on the way up.

Keep yourself a nice little moonbag on a separate wallet so it's harder to get to.

While community is a fun and engaging aspect in crypto, don't let the community cloud your judgement.  It's way too easy to get wrapped up in the fun and the hype.  It's also unfortunately one of my favorite things.

Meme coin curiosity,"Okay this post is purely out of curiosity and speculation. I don’t know a lot about investing in crypto other than the fact that you can do it through an exchange, wallet, or a ledger of some kind. I’m not a complete idiot, maybe just a little bit of one, but I’ve always seen the meme coin success stories and thought…. “dang that would be cool to do one day.” I made the mistake of putting some in doge back in the day so I really don’t want to burn money and do that again… but my question is: 

How do people research and find these super low, unheard of coins? Where are they? And most importantly, if they’re not listed on big exchanges, how do you invest in them? I really have no idea how people are finding Pepe at a fraction of a dollar, investing, and selling all before it’s mainstream and listed on popular sites.

"Thinking back, what would you have done if you could have anticipated the fall of the bullrun and the beginning of the bear winter?","I think it's pretty simple.

From September 2020 to April 2021, there was a big surge in crypto values, followed by a big drop until July 2021, and then the resumption of the rise until November 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lb8ex1pl60za1.jpg?width=358&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8362170eb8cdeb0ea874a9c167f501920d7f808f

So imagine coming back at the end of 2021, to a time when DOGE and the incredible rise in crypto values had brought in a lot of new people, to a time when Terra Luna was just starting its rise and SHIB was exploding. A time when BTC was almost at $70,000 and all the ""influencers"" were selling the dream with an explosion of values until the end of the year. Nothing seemed to stop the crypto anymore.

One morning, while looking at your wallet, and watching the news, a feeling takes you to the stomach, for you, some signs are alarming, you feel the end of the bull run, and you foresee the end of the cycle with a severe and brutal fall over several years.

The famous crypto winter that everyone was dreading is coming and you need to find a strategy to protect yourself.

Setting up stop-loss orders can help you limit your losses and minimize the emotional aspect of making trading decisions during volatile times.  \n4. \\*\\*Hold Stablecoins\\*\\*: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far.

The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding.

Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far. The risks in terms of centralization and potential sell offs created by that are obvious.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Prior to that, I\'d held a triple-digit position in LTC since ~2013. I did make money from this coin. That is only because of my time in the market, and not any particular strength of the coin in question. Truth be told, I\'d have made more money being in other positions, so it is irrelevant. Perhaps I\'ll regret it one day. Perhaps not.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC is one of the ""OG"" coins. [As a fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it\'s been around almost as long.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litecoin.asp) It is a very secure coin, and utilizes [Proof of Work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) through Scrypt to maintain that security.\n&gt; \n&gt; * This ""early mover"" advantage has allowed LTC to catapult into some very strong positions and use cases. I\'d personally put it\'s [uses on the Paypal platform](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-litecoin-faq4401) as one of it\'s strongest positions in the current financial zeitgeist. [There are certainly lots of others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/csfixo/1100_companies_and_stores_accepting_litecoin_as/).\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC is arguably the strongest PoW coin available. It is faster than BTC, cheaper to use, and available for use basically everywhere relevant that BTC is. As far as trading platforms and ""on-ramps"" for converting fiat currency into cryptocurrency, LTC will get you where you want to go. While it is not worth as much as BTC, it\'s far more capable for doing what a cryptocurrency is ""supposed"" to do. Ya know, be a currency that doesn\'t cost silly amounts of fees to use and take forever to confirm.\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC\'s development team is currently working on implementing [Mimblewimble](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/mimblewimble-explained/) capabilities to the coin. The quick and dirty for that is adding a ""privacy feature"" to LTC, as well as potentially solving scalability issues that could crop up one day if usage of the coin were to exponentially increase. Development is ongoing in 2021, and viability/efficacy is not fully determined as of this writing.\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC follows the same [halving](https://stormgain.com/blog/litecoin-ltc-halving) protocol as BTC. This has correlated to price increases for the coin in a similar fashion to BTC after each of these ""cycles"". It stands to reason that LTC should see another price increase in the 2024-2025 time-frame, coinciding with the next halving [set to occur in Q3 2023](https://litecoinblockhalf.com/). There\'s math and wrinkly-brain reasons for why it takes some time for the halving process to reflect in the market price. You\'d have to go searching; I don\'t really understand it.

My goal is to remain as unbiased as possible for these write-ups, and I will speak only to the positives of LTC in this thread. I encourage you, the reader, to view both sides and make an educated decision before investing in *any* crypto asset.\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC offers a ""tried and trusted"" investment platform. If there was a stock to compare LTC to, it\'s the massive ETF or mutual fund that people put money into year after year and reliably draw a profit from. You will not see the insane fireworks of a DOGE pump, or the rug-pull of a [BITCONNEEEEECT](https://thenextweb.com/news/bitconnect-bitcoin-scam-cryptocurrency) when you put your money into LTC. You will get an investment that ""should"" make you money in the long run, and potentially set you up for some really solid gains in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC is not the behemoth that BTC is within the crypto space. The intimidation that comes from the price-tag that BTC sometimes wields ($37K to own one coin at the time of this writing, 60K+ attained) can be a turn-off for the smaller investor still interested in owning a ""full coin"". While this mindset is considered by veterans within the space to be somewhat naive and counterproductive, it is a psychological aspect that affects many projects within crypto. LTC\'s ability to allow someone to jump in at a much lower price point and still feel like their investment is ""effective"" is certainly a strength.\n&gt; \n&gt; * LTC has been picked up in the 2021 bull-run by [large institutional entities](https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-adds-174000-ltc-to-its-litecoin-holdings-price-of-the-altcoin-unresponsive/), signalling some confidence in it\'s ability to generate income in some fashion for shareholders/investors. It remains to be seen how this action will play out, as the events are too closely aligned with the large correction in late May 2021 before the coin could pick up steam. [It briefly touched a high-300s price-tag](https://currency.com/litecoin-price-prediction-2021), and many of LTC\'s supporters believe that it was aiming to go higher before the entire market dropped.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n&gt; \n&gt; LTC has carved out a solid niche for itself over the years, and a loyal base that wants to see it succeed. As with any investment into a volatile market like crypto, there\'s a good chance you could lose some money. That said, I would put the chances of it happening with LTC over the long run at a smaller percentage than some of the more risky or ""unreliable"" projects in the space. If you have patience and are looking for a low-stress coin with some realistic use cases and a good track record for ease-of-use and operability within the crypto-world, LTC may be the coin for you!\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Proof of Work really emphasises the work. Lots of miners use huge amounts of computational power to attempt to solve problems on average every 10 minutes. The computational power needed is so great and there are so many nodes operating that a bad actor can not be expected to be able to manipulate the network, thus giving it security. The difficulty and computational power, while helping to secure the network, also helps to deter risks to the network. One such risk is spammers, which are unlikely to gain profit due to the expenditure of energy needed. While some may see this huge amount of power to be a major downside, it is necessary for the security of the network and actually less than what is used by standard financial systems. Much of the energy is also reported to be extra electricity or green power. One of the criticisms of PoW deals with 51% attacks, which occur when over 51% of miners/nodes take control of the Blockchain by working together. This was most notable with the amount of miners in china due to cheap electricity. However, China has increased regulation and the power china once held has diminished. With increased adoption, possible risks like this will be reduced as miners/nodes will be dispersed. Speaking of dispersion, PoW also results in increased decentralization. One final benefit of PoW is the reward miners get. PoW gives miners a block reward and a share of transaction fees for working on the network. While some say diminishing returns for miners is a weakness for PoW, some coins are coming up with creative solutions. Ergo for example will charge ""rent"" to wallets that are inactive for 4 years and use this to reward miners and secure the network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was [originally introduced in the 1990s for emails](https://www.kraken.com/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake), in 2004 [Hal Finney suggested](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) using it for securing digital money, which Satoshi Nakamoto then famously did. PoW is one of the aspects most criticized in crypto, which has a number of reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt; PoW is incredibly [inefficient](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/proof-of-work/). This leads to slow transaction speed and high fees, which is bad enough. The worst effect of this, however, is that because of this it has an absurd environmental impact. I don\'t think I have to go into detail about this here, but [BTC alone](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons) currently uses 0.57% of the world\'s energy, more than Ukraine - which is completely absurd. This is usually the biggest point of criticism of BTC and other PoW coins and is the reason why, for example, [EU regulators are advising the EU to ban PoW](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/01/19/eu-regulator-calls-for-a-ban-on-proof-of-work-bitcoin-mining-to-save-renewable-energy).\n&gt; \n&gt; Another big disadvantage of PoW is that they only provide good security if there is a large netweork of miners. [If that\'s not the case, the blockchains are vulnerable to 51% attacks](https://komodoplatform.com/en/academy/proof-of-work/#disadvantages-of-proof-of-work-blockchains). While this doesn\'t apply to huge chains like BTC, smaller chains could be attacked for [relatively small amounts of money using a service like NiceHash](https://www.crypto51.app/).\n&gt; \n&gt; High costs of mining and the fact that who gets the rewards is a lottery incentivices the formation of mining pools if miners want a good and somewhat stable income from mining. This means, that PoW [""has an inherent inclination toward centralization""](https://medium.com/logos-network/why-proof-of-work-is-not-viable-in-the-long-term-dd96d2775e99). With bigger chains, you need such [specialized equipment](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) to be able to mine that it\'s not viable for the average Joe anyways.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

People on this sub don't get this.,"I'll make this short and to the point. This post is about memecoins and the hate surrounding it.

Everyone is saying that the only people who profited off of pepe are insiders and early investors. In reality, normal people who didnt get any inside info actually made money on coins like pepe and doge and other shitcoins. Even i was lucky to get on the hype train at the right time and made some profit.

 As someone said, great investments doesn't always mean great businesses. This is more true in crypto.

Unless you're in it just for the tech which i highly doubt, you have no reason to hate it or the insiders who made profit off of it.
Try to understand the ongoing trend and ride the wave. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to put your money in memecoins now, but just outright hating anything won't make you learn a thing. Just look at those people in buttcoin sub as an example. Don't be like them.

Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are  totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases.

In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have  Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they  often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice.

Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation,  even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation.

While this type of system is certainly more secure than single-signed wallets for the average, this is nowhere near as secure it should be for a protocol that controls billions of user funds on a daily basis.\n&gt;    * It is noted that about $2m worth of tokens were [returned by the Lossless protocol,](https://beincrypto.com/harmony-hack-how-lossless-saved-78m-stolen-tokens/) which may have a promising future.\n&gt; * **Not Unique**\n&gt;    * Ziliqa exists as an alternative to Harmony, and does almost exactly what Harmony does - albeit on its own network. \n&gt;    * Since Ethereum itself is trying to solve the problems that Harmony identifies, it's only a matter of time before ONE is made obsolete. \n&gt; * **'Next-gen' technology is a hindrance**\n&gt;    * Harmony's technology [hinges on 5G technology](https://learn.bybit.com/altcoins/harmony-crypto/) to work at full efficiency, which is not available in many parts of the world.\n&gt;    * Hence, accessibility is severely reduced.\n&gt; * **Infinite Inflation**\n&gt;    * The token's supply is not capped, and it mints 441 million ONE each year. \n&gt;    * As a result, while stakers are rewarded generously, holders continually lose money as the price of ONE is pushed down by excess supply.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Why I'm short since 31k yet not bearish overall,"I haven't made a TA post in here for a long time but I've seen a lot of people being a bit confused about recent price action so I thought I share my thoughts.

**DISCLAIMER:**

This is not a financial advice. Technical Analysis is just a part of a traders arsenal to take positions and predict future price action. Investors &amp; market sentiment, macro economic conditions &amp; sudden news always require to stay sharp and possibly change strategies. Although this is representing a current technical analysis things can always change completely tomorrow. **This is an educational &amp; entertaining post but not to take serious as a guaranteed outcome of future price action.**

**WHY**

The main reason for my short positions was the heavy rejection of 30k+. The current macro conditions are uncertain. Although you could argue that a chance of a mild recession and declining inflation is priced in, we are still in uncertain territory. What if the recession comes in hotter than expected? What if inflation doesn't cool down and it requires the fed to remain more hawkish? Although Bitcoin is known as ""the bluechip of Crypto"" it still remains a very risky asset when you consider all assets. Uncertainty is usually driving investors to less risky assets such as bonds or bluechip stocks ( which is a reason for the recent AAPL &amp; MSFT strength ) but also other high market cap stocks. If BTC bleeds over the next week I expect it to also further drag down the alt coin market.On top of that Liquidity is still a very underappreciated indicator reflecting price action and it remains low and on a decline

**current trend on the BTC 4h chart:**

https://preview.redd.it/f6y9e30ss70b1.png?width=2537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821e44a9c97242297e963620b8bd71f2a71d78c8

First the 31k area was rejected. I've exited my longs there from the oversold ( ridiculous ) USDC drama and decided to sit on the sidelines from there and watch. No short position yet. Afterwards there was another run up to the 30k area and the rejection was even heavier especially with the sharp drop that one day that some of you might remember causing a -7% dip. The days after it continous to fail breaking through and holding the 30k area. After the last attempt and another clean rejection on high Volume I've decided to take my short positions on BTC &amp; mutliple Alt coins.

The orange circle shows a called ""Liquidity clear out"" known term &amp; move by market makers or general oversold condition in the trading world. It moves the price sharply for a short period of time below the ""support area"" that retail uses for their stop losses. Market Makers &amp; traders are aware about this and move purposely the price below that area causing a liquidation cascade. The high volume is very attractive for larger players to buy up and fill their positions while traders notice it and jump in scalping the reversal. This is why we saw a sharp bounce immediately after and an uptrend since then.

Short positions have been opened on the way up coming from a short chasing retail sentiment which have been squeezed towards the 27,500 area.**visible short squeeze towards 27,500**

https://preview.redd.it/5z9bzyejx70b1.png?width=2504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c8024fb56c0557289b788cb58311bc98c0552a9

the 27,500-27,600 area is an important one for traders. What used to act as support has now become ressistance which is why many traders have taken profit around that area. I was waiting for it to break and hold above as well but unfortunately it was again rejected and fell below. If broken &amp; price held above it might indicate a reversal in the trend.

This is very noticeable lately in the stock market that is moving more sideways with low volatility and volume. Also visible on the VIX chart which is referred to as the ""fear gauge"" which hit this month a low last seen in the middle of the bullrun 2021.

**The DXY chart also looking like it's recovering here with a potentially double bottom.** DXY represents the Dollar Strength. Bitcoin but also the stock market usually react inversed to it. ( falling DXY -&gt; rising assets, rising DXY -&gt; falling assets )

So I've taken a short position in BTC, ETH but mostly in alt coins. One of the main reason is the strong shift towards Bitcoin in the general crypto sentiment. Although some alt coins have outperformed BTC there is a clear trend visible since the start of the bear market if you exclude stablecoins:

**BTC dominance chart excluding stablecoins:**

Which is even more visible when you compare the BTC chart with the Altcoin chart excluding BTC &amp; ETH

**BTC chart:**

**My target**

My target would be the 200 moving average indicator on the daily chart which should be reached around \~24k in the next week if the trend continous. Then I'll pay attention whether it breaks or bounces off as strong support.

https://preview.redd.it/hdg14ao4280b1.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=367e71615a5b5c904f19a42a6efeb4c819f1c128

**my bullish counter arguments against my own play:**

That being said I'm still skeptical about my own positions. There is still a high chance that the recent interest in BTC will continue and trigger a reversal. Very interesting to me was the strength during the banking crisis and the correlation with Gold. I think this is something very underappreciated &amp; undervalued that many people haven't noticed yet.

In case you diddn't know yet GOLD is the ""most valueable asset"" globally with a market cap of $13.1+ Trillion. When investors treat BTC with a market cap of ""only"" 524 Billion similar to GOLD there could be way more demand coming during a crisis.

**Inflation**

Something also important to keep in mind is that although inflation is cooling down, it remains high.VENEZUELA 155%

ARGENTINA  104%

And that is before the halving. So overall BTC is still winning the race in value against majority of currencies. Remember, the super wealthy target stability not really becoming richer. They want to win the race against inflation and not sit on their wealth that loses buying power overtime. BTC will remain attractive especially with the incoming halving.

**CONCLUSION:**

For me personally we had a nice little bear market rally that brought back some beautiful and enjoyable bull market vibes. We had Memecoins &amp; Shitcoins pumping, Musk tweeting NFTs that catapult in prices same as changing the Twitter Logo causing a huge DOGE Pump &amp; Dump.

However the macro conditions and fundamentals are still not looking great. This isn't 2020 / 2021 and the outlook for it to be similar in the near future is just not there. Therefore I remain bearish on crypto overall, neutral on BTC with a short term bearish outlook **but bullish overall for the future of crypto.**

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Friends in the US who visit companies such as AMC or Starbucks. Do you pay with Crypto?,"A question for our US friends really, just wondering if you use Crypto day to day at companies that offer payment by this route?

Something jolted in my memory whilst at the Cinema the other day that AMC, made news a year or so ago about taking cryptocurency payments (BTC/LTC/ETH). They also sell giftcards via Bitpay and accept Doge.

But I can't see any update on how this has gone, if it's used and adopted better or if it's just almost a 'gimmick' of the chain to appeal to it's retail investors back in the memestock heyday.

The CEO tweeted when it was announced something that seemed bullish at first, reading as if 14% of online transactions were from Crypto..

 *""Big newsflash! As promised, many new ways NOW to pay online at AMC.  We  proudly now accept: drumroll, please… Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash,  Litecoin. Also Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal.* ***Incredibly, they already  account for 14% of our total online transactions!*** *Dogecoin next.""*

But I think reading it properly it means Crypto/Apple Pay/Google Pay/Paypal combined account for 14% of their total transactions?

TechCrunch had an article in April last year pointing otu that the AMC App now accepts DOGE/SHIB

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 4th monthly report for the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for almost 5.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/)***.***
* **APRIL Highlights:** \- **BNB** wins the month. **Bitcoin** is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by **ADA** in second place.
* The 2023 portfolio is +36% so far this year. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&amp;P 500 over the same time period (see below for details).
* **New feature:** for the fourth straight month, total market cap token **AMKT** outperforms my Top Ten in April and is +63% vs. the Top Ten's +36% in 2023 in this year’s friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**). 

## Month Four – Up +36%

https://preview.redd.it/eldew7vxi01b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1fd8eaad773aefb08a1b89df4a3fc0946170414

The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC.**

April highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Another mixed month for the 2023 Top Ten, the third straight after an all-green [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1).
* **BNB’s** \+6% was enough for an April victory. **ETH** and **BTC** were the only other two coins in positive territory.
* **Bitcoin** is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by **ADA** in second place.

## April Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks four months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/zlp9nxdzi01b1.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f94d9c18abfd0863b606d3e629891a1af06b74

Remarkably steady so far during the first 120 days of 2023, with only **BUSD** dropping out of the original portfolio, replaced by **SOL**.

## April Winner and Loser

***April Winner*** –  **BNB’s** modest gain (+6%) was enough to win in April. 

***April Loser*** – For the second time in a row, **MATIC** was the worst performing crypto of the group, falling -12% this month.

## Overall Update: BTC maintains lead, ADA moves into second place, all crypto in the green.

Every crypto in this year’s Experiment is still in positive territory.

**BTC** holds on to the top spot after overtaking **MATIC** for the lead last month. The initial $100 invested in **BTC** four months ago is worth $172 today. 

**ADA** is next, +57% since New Year’s Day.  

**DOGE** is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, but is still in the green at +12% for the year. Much wow.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/6igkssr0j01b1.png?width=307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9fa6b3bd33ebcf8726cf2d16e2b19b252b64951

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio lost $40 in April.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$1,362.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/hyg2kvw1j01b1.png?width=247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32f7bfe999e85c7de03eb810abf31f93c1c360c

## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

**New feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 5+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index.  Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

Here’s the question I’m tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.  Four months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/0t86tfg3j01b1.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7654a696f40ab34b5db232f112ebc33b6151d18

**April Performances:**

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**: -3% 
* **AMKT**: +0%

The April monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2023:** 

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $1,362 (+36%) 
* **AMKT:** current value $1,628 (+63%)

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/z0chnsq4j01b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e66f8c5380f7c6fb70fc9077778c2e616d6dd74

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2023 Top Ten is one of six concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -36% (total value $639)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +227% (total value $3,267)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +399% (total value $4,989) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +95% (total value $1,955)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $311) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +36% (total value $1,362)

Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$12,523.** 

**That’s up +109%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/096sow16j01b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1f6b64569cf7a5d837dc5438fa19706f832f9a

In summary: ***That’s a +109% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/55dqgn97j01b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b5fefb64f3859059474f587e886d184293fc716

The S&amp;P 500 is up +9% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,090 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,560 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,660 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,290 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,090 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,580.**

That is up **+26%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+109%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

"Despite ETH native staking withdrawals being unlocked, 40% of the 33.3B staked ETH is liquid staking. LIDO staked ETH is currently #8 on the charts even above Doge","Liquid staking has really taken off. It seem that a lot of people want to stake but don't have the 32ETH, the staking computing resources or simply don't want to deal with native staking complexities like delegation even without needing to set up their own validation hardware and software. 

The liquid staking market accounts for 40% of the total amount of staked ETH.

The total native stake is 33.3B and the liquid staking capitalization is around 13.6B. 

Off of this, Lido Staked ETH STETH has managed to gain near a 12 Billion market cap and is ranked #8.

''","1. Commenter 1:  I don’t own any crypto and I don’t think I’d leave money or crypto on an exchange except for short term trading. But if I ever buy crypto again I will keep it on a hardware wallet
2. Commenter 2 :  Why? Because most of it is straight garbage, and the amount of garbage in the crypto space multiplies every day. It's getting worse as time goes by, not better. Seriously. It's taken far more steps backward than forward over the past few years
3. Commenter 3: TA? Come on man
4. Commenter 4(replied to another commenter who said people hear what they do not know) : People also fear the blood-covered naked guy running down the street with an assault rifle in each hand
5. Commenter 5: Deep down you know it's mostly bollocks
6. Commenter 6: Put down the pipe
7. Commenter 7: Cryptocurrencies are dead assets that do no work and buying them is speculation, not investment
8. Commenter 8:  Bitcoin is the exact same as doge, do you consider bitcoin just as bad? The only differences are block sizes and how much can be mined but doge has not been hitting artificial limits yet. 

Aren't I supposed to believe in crypto now that I am in the market? Aren't we supposed to believe in it and support it? What if newbies read negative comments and think of it as scam while it's not and you know it! I have no problems with warning people about shitcoins and scam coins in the market but DON'T YOU tell me that Btc is not legit, Eth is not legit, I know 99% are scam coins but still there are many legit projects out there, why do many people hate on crypto at the same time they spread FUD and call it scam?

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention.

Hardware comparing Model T vs Nano X,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X.

Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides.

Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods.

The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely.

Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware?

(Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Security chip

The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances).

Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this.

&amp;#x200B;

# Size of the memory

Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB

&amp;#x200B;

# Supported coins

Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

Note the table below I took the info from

[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

[https://trezor.io/coins](https://trezor.io/coins)

and had a thing help me make the table. They both support ERC20 and BEP20. Meaning any token that is that, both will support. I'm not going through every token to make sure it matches this. I'm only looking at the sites.

"Set up a ""crypto will"": How to transfer your coins to your loved ones from the grave","I've posted on this before, but I saw some recent discussion on this topic and figured it might be worth a revisit.

Let's make a plan to bestow your precious coins to your loved ones upon your untimely demise!

A simple way to do this is by creating a **""dead person's switch""** via Google's Inactive Account Manager. Once enabled, Google will automatically send a custom email to the family/friends of your choosing after a certain period has elapsed since you were last active on your Google account. Not to worry - you *won't be putting your private keys in this email*. Google will also attempt to contact you a month before this actually happens, in order to prevent mistakes!

---

# How to create a dead-person's switch for your crypto holdings:

1. Go to Google's [Inactive Account Manager](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive)

2. Set a waiting period of something ridiculous, like 6 or 12 or even 18 months (good for forcing the HODL from the grave!) since you were last active.

3. Craft a nerdy email to your loved ones with important info on how to access your stash. **DON'T put your actual private keys or website passwords here**, as this will be stored on a Google server somewhere. Just put instructions on how to access your PHYSICAL belongings like your laptop, phone, hardware wallet, safe deposit box, etc. Then direct them to a password-protected file stored LOCALLY on your computer / USB drive containing the rest of the instructions on how to access your crypto. For password protection, you can use something free and open-source like 7-Zip to turn any file or folder into an encrypted archive.

4. Remember to tell your family you love them and apologize cheekily for accumulating DOGE at $0.05 despite them telling you to get a job. Maybe even give them some of your degen yield-farming tips!

Sit back, relax, and enjoy providing generational ~~ramen~~ wealth for your family from the grave!



I realize that this solution isn't perfect (ie, a Google employee could travel to your house and steal your laptop), but I feel that for some, there may be a high barrier to entry to getting a lawyer, drafting a will, or otherwise paying an estate planning agency for their services. 

The intention of this post is to illuminate an easily-accessible tool from which you can easily craft your own custom solution! Thoughts welcome.

"3 years into crypto, what's changed and what's your perspective?","Just curious about other redditors, what's changed in their opinion, what got better, what got worse, what they think about the future of our beloved tokens and currencies.

I joined this sub two years ago to stay up to date with the late new in crypto world and soon discovered that there's just too much to keep up!

I'm not much of a spender, I'd rather say I'm poor, I'm one hell of a shrimp and in a couple of years managed to buy just fractions of a Bitcoin and a little more than one whole ETH, that was my goal since the beginning, one ETH. Then played around with altcoins but in the end is just a wasting of time imho as the, solid ones are the blue chips of crypto. Tried holding DOT, ADa, Algo, Near (The new Solana...meh.) Solana itself, sold just before the 200$pump, and a bunch od Doge.

All at some point everything got converted in Eth or BTC., since I'm too lazy to trade and hodling fits better my personality! :D

In the meanwhile the space here got really exciting, more news that you can't read, lots of shitposting but still interesting insights almost every day, 6.4 million members when it seems the other day we celebrated reaching 3m. This thing went big quick,now we got banners, for fuck's sake! Advertisers dig this sub!

Moons started to become a thing and didn't realize it until i've seen I got a thousand, just for chatting on a form about my beloved cryptos., I couldn't believe they were worth something.

Some exchanges went down too, condolences to all fellow redditors hurted by that, it sucks, but imho it's a necessary evil to make crypto environment healthier and stronger.

I don't see mainstream adoption anytime soon, I think it will be a slow process, but still inexorable in a matter of five or ten years.

Forbes put Tether in their top 10 crypto investments for May. Lazy journalism or lack of knowledge?,"Hi everyone,

Yesterday Forbes made an article about the top 10 crypto investments for May. First of all this is a bit late since we're almost in June. Secondly I saw Tether in it. Since Tether is a stablecoin it's very strange to put it in a top 10 crypto investment list. 

**Their top 10 crypto investments for May are:**

1. BTC
2. ETH
3. **USDT**
4. BNB
5. XRP
6. ADA
7. SOL
8. DOT 
9. LTC
10. AVAX

**What they wrote about Tether exactly:**

[USDT explanation in https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/in\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/top-10-cryptocurrencies\/](https://preview.redd.it/wipjiazed82b1.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c879b351c28f37ae148f965651714c19bafed0c)

They write about Tether being a stablecoin, but they still think it's a good crypto investment for May. Now they say that Tether is favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins, but that's crypto in general right? 

The only argument I can think of is that people that live in countries with hyperinflation 'invest' in USDT to not lose value over their money, but that's also possible if you just convert to US dollars.

In my opinion it's very lazy journalism. Because they almost copy past the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and put it in the article just to have one. 

**The current top 10 in market cap:**

https://preview.redd.it/8z5o98d3f82b1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5fc768cf32fa6857ec7e3800968c877e5bee99

As you can see they only left out USDC, DOGE and MATIC from the current top 10. And they replaced it by DOT (rank 13), LTC (rank 12) and AVAX (rank 17).

Exactly 2 years ago Elon said he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price has gone down over 79%,"He first started trying to slowly bring it up to his Twitter followers on April 2, 2019. Probably he schemed an idea to buy shitload of Doge and then try to bring it back to mainstream to his cult fanboys and make shitload of money that way if price increases incredibly because of it. He made four tweets  that day regarding to Doge. Here is screenshot of first three. Fourth was just linking an article about Dogecoin.

Then I guess he forgot about it or postponed his idea, and only started to advertise it pretty heavily like 1.5 years later, price has gone immensely up and it all culminated in anticipation of his SNL appearance. And on May 25 of 2021, exactly 2 years ago he even  he even seriously stated that he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price of Doge has gone down over 79.6%, and that wasn't even the lowest price that many people bought the Doge for who trusted Elon for some reason.

Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))\n&gt; \n&gt; # PROs\n&gt; \n&gt; **It's Decentralized**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. No need for a central authority\n&gt; 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)\n&gt; 3. Ledger is distributed and public\n&gt; 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner\n&gt; 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address\n&gt; 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source\n&gt; \n&gt; **Provides Privacy**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Security**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))\n&gt; \n&gt; **Scarcity**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability.

It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, despite its popularity and growing acceptance as a legitimate form of payment, there are several criticisms of Bitcoin that have been raised over the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Unclear Source of Value\n&gt; \n&gt; * Stocks derive their value from the underlying worth of a company and its assets. Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country\'s economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries.\n&gt; * Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory—all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.""\n&gt; * Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile.\n&gt;    * Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear.\n&gt; * Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose. (source: [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/))\n&gt;    * Without its utility being utilized, then, Bitcoin\'s value is significantly diminished.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Deepseated Stigma\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite its potential to revolutionize the financial industry, Bitcoin has faced significant resistance from mainstream institutions and individuals due to a variety of factors.\n&gt; \n&gt; * One of the main reasons for the stigma surrounding Bitcoin is its association with illegal activities. In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073)\n&gt; * Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value.\n&gt;    * Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices.

This might not sound like the most grandiose of titles, but it does carry weight. Since Doge's inception, countless other meme coins have followed in Doge's footsteps (or pawsteps), including SHIB, Banano and DogelonMars. Whenever these coins receive attention, they are inevitably compared to Doge (in a similar way to how new non-meme coins are often compared to Bitcoin/Ethereum). This creates ever more visibility and demand for Doge, as it is seen as the Bitcoin of meme coins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Doge coin has had serious adoption. To name just a few places one can spend Doge coin, you can spend the meme coin at the Dallas Mavericks, ExpressVPN, Ledger, and airBaltic. That is more adoption than most serious coins. This sort of adoption, and potential for more adoption in the future, makes Doge coin a great investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, memes. The ability to create memes about a coin, without it seeming forced, is a non-trivial marketing tool. One can easily create extra traction and visibility for Doge, allowing Doge to welcome in new investors with ease. Often, other coins try this technique, but it seems insincere and a little on the nose. The ability to meme about a coin, especially in the social media age, is a feature that separates Doge from the rest of the pack.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The Evolution of DOGE Pronunciation,"DOGE got its start in 2013 and there has been conversation since on how to pronounce it.

**Slate ran a poll in 2014 on how to pronounce DOGE**

It was split about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 for dohj, dohg, and two-syllable close to dog-ee.

**A Reddit poll in 2015 showed some change in the perceived pronunciation**

https://preview.redd.it/v9n5aibkgh2b1.png?width=1490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86dd32d43ba0ac9da577a936d1336bc74730578a

Dohj took the lead with 43%, then dohg with 38%, and 11% with two-syllable close to dog-ee. It was clear that dog-ee was falling out of favor fast.

**Fast forward to 2023 and it is known that it is pronounced dohj. There is no debate anymore.** Jackson Palmer, one of the founders, put out a YouTube video  with the ""correct"" pronunciation.

I really hope we have learned from our mistakes from the past bull run by now and won‘t be using sites such as Robinhood anymore.,"Everyday you live through right now is just one day closer to the next bull market, whenever that may come. But we have a lot of things to do before that happens anyway, that is mostly reflecting on our previous bull market to make sure that we don‘t make the same mistakes again. If we waited for two years now for a bull market, but just make the same stupid mistakes, it was all for nothing basically.

Reflecting and improving upon your prior mistakes is probably one of the most important actions to take, especially here in Crypto, so let‘s have a look at some of the big ones (from my personal experience):

1. Not selling, yeah just holding onto your coins is not always good especially if you invested in a project just for the profits, then you should also have the courage to take those profits.

2. FOMOing, by now we should know that by the time everyone here is talking about something you already missed the train with the big profits and will now just become some exit liquidity.

3. Using the right platforms.

Yeah this one may be one of the most important, especially even after 2022. You have to choose the sites carefully where you store your Crypto and where you also trade some. The grand example for that may be Robinhood. Yeah, in 2021 Robinhood was all the hype and everyone wanted their Crypto Wallets on it and the listings of Cryptos like DOGE on there was heavily anticipated. Many were just too late to see how they were manipulating the prices themselves.

Hopefully we will stay true to our words and be stronger, wilder, faster and most importantly smarter during our next bull market.",61,109,2023-05-28 21:13:12,,CryptoCurrency,REMINDER,"[('[deleted]', 0), (""RobinHood isn't likely to lose its position as one of the most used broker and exchange anytime soon, people have already forgotten all about it"", 2), ('[deleted]', -1), ('[deleted]', 0), ('[deleted]', 0), ('Use the exchange as an exchange and not as a deposit.', 11), ('Fun fact: Robinhood owns 26.03% of the total DOGECOIN supply. \n\nThey control the top 2 addresses.\n\n[source ](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/dogecoin/richlist/)', 7), ('Watch people use FTX 2.0 when it relaunches, I wont be surprised.', 9), ('I am just not paying attention to Robinhood, I even think we are giving them more popularity by talking about them so often..', -1), ('[deleted]', 1), ('Yes!

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"
We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. 

Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. 

So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. 

Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 

1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

3.  Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

6. Meme Coins -  (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

8. Liquid Staking Tokens  (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

"PEPE site homepage has a frog, pants down butt out and pissing on memecoin logos. PEPE pumps and dumps multiple times everyday. The same PEPE that is by far one of the most well-known and easily in top 100 most valuable tokens by market cap. This is embarrassing for the ""future of finance"" in crypto","PEPE is by far one off the most popular tokens. It was ranked in the top 50 tokens after hitting very nearly a 2 Billion market cap. Even today it still sits in the top 100 after losing over a Billion of market cap. It saw insane price increase of 1000% in a week, even before the Binance listing which again doubled the price. If you ask someone to randomly name a few crypto tokens, PEPE will probably be in that list. There's definitely **very** few in crypto who *haven't* heard of PEPE. Yet, we don't have to dig very deeply to be disappointed.

The pepe website homepage is pretty barebones and poorly done, probably by design, but the worst part is definitely this.

One of the most premier tokens has this as an advertising banner. I saw a document that claimed to be the whitepaper use a lot of material of this homepage in it, but it's unclear if there actually is an official whitepaper at all. Regardless of an official whitepaper or just the official website, this is pretty bad.

Of course the whole roadmap and pitch with Phase 1 MEME etc is pretty poor as well. The about section ironically call out the ridiculousness of modern memecoins(or mostly sh\*tcoins realistically) but also just buys right back into it for self-shilling.

On June 23, 2022, Harmony One was hacked, with $100 million of assets on the Horizon bridge being stolen. The bridge functioned on a 2/5 multisig contract, so the hacker(s) was able to gain access to the funds by compromising the server and getting hold of these two addresses. The question begs as to why the developers chose to be negligent of ONE’s security system. In an attempt to do damage control, the Harmony team offered bounties twice - $1 million the first time and $10 million the second time - in hopes that the culprit(s) would be enticed to return the stolen funds. Unfortunately, both bounties were futile. To be fair, the developers do not shirk their responsibilities as they are currently working on various plans that address about 50,000 wallets spanning across 14 assets amounting to $97.6 million. Nonetheless, this hack eroded many users’ confidence in regards to the robustness of ONE’s security measures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he’s lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. 

However, there’s more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it’s a little easier to make profits in crypto. He’s undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it’s still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world’s largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it’s also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. **So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he’s unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each.** While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling!

Edit to add: I should’ve titled this “but only in there money he’s lost”. I hope it’s clear from this post that I think he’s a huge manipulator and a problem for our crypto space.

$1k invested into the Top Ten Cryptos in January 2021 - Month 28 (UP +95%)," 

https://preview.redd.it/pqaucdaqlm3b1.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eadb8a5d257718e1041889267f3b06070472a4fd

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.** Below is the latest update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and again in 2023 because I'm a glutton for punishment (and to show different entry points).
* ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **APRIL HIGHLIGHTS:** mostly flat with about half of the cryptos single digits in the red this month. Overall, **BNB** well in first place +767%. **ETH** distant second place +150%, ADA in 3rd place +116%. 2021 Portfolio +95% vs S&amp;P's +11%
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +109% compared to +26% in the S&amp;P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.**

## Month Twenty-Eight – UP 95%

https://preview.redd.it/3ppwgpjsmm3b1.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=506cc1c19a4457c8fdbbe717299d6f644dc2ef90

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* Mixed, but mostly red month for the 2021 Portfolio
* **BNB continues to maintain a strong overall lead, BTC approaching break even point**
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +95% in twenty-eight months

## April Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/a2jheaftmm3b1.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5537f4c262b6f4f365a94eea2d8ec785ddce3b01

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  twenty-eight months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, four cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**  They have been replaced by **MATIC**, **SOL, DOGE,** and **USDC**. 

## April Winners and Losers

***April Winners*** – **BNB** was the clear winner this month, up +6%.

***April Losers*** – **XRP** turned in the worst performance in April (-9%).

## Overall Update – BNB dominates, 50% of cryptos in green, BTC approaching break even point, BCH worst performing

As has been the case for much of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up +767%, the $100 investment into **BNB** twenty-eight months ago is now worth **$869. ETH** is in distant second place, up +150%, the $100 now worth $251.

At the bottom, **BCH** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-66%** since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/2lhsm7oumm3b1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14343b16982ac037e82f0c1847f1b1886582a52

As a sector, crypto is up **+51%** since January 2021.

You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has produced better returns than the overall crypto market cap (+95% vs. +51%) over the twenty-eight month life of the 2021 Portfolio.

This is a bit of an outlier: the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind over their respective market caps in their respective time frames.  Here are the latest figures:

* 2018 Top Ten Portfolio: -36% for the Top Ten vs. +104% for the total market cap
* 2019 Top Ten Portfolio: +227% for the Top Ten vs. +822% for the total market cap 
* 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: +399% for the Top Ten vs. +518% for the total market cap 
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio:  +95% for the Top Ten vs. +51% for the total market cap
* 2022 Top Ten Portfolio: -69% for the Top Ten vs. -47% for the total market cap
* 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: +36% for the Top Ten vs. 47% for the total market cap

Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$775B in January 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$2.6T in October 2021.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10)

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/tyfk454wmm3b1.png?width=513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0322fb732fd9fe15948206ed2020d91012a11473

**BitDom** has bounced a bit in recent months, now sitting at 46.8%. 

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/1q234uwxmm3b1.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8026e6386849a7e196b4190bfd68a1b590d7baaf

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +95%.  The initial $1000 investment twenty-eight months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$1,955**. 

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective as we go along:  


https://preview.redd.it/79la6oxymm3b1.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c1edd0c276521170b5b53cdb6fb5bcebf8b717

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios**

As most readers are aware, this is the sixth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -36% (total value $639)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +227% (total value $3,267)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +399% (total value $4,989) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +95% (total value $1,955)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $311) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +36% (total value $1,362)

So overall? Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$12,523.** 

**That’s up +109%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.

To visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/m79tgcn0nm3b1.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ee385c634040a88e19209d8d644c77d182e217e

In summary: ***That's a +109% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/dye0ido1nm3b1.png?width=541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c39e30912fa0772def86c1a95b9c9463ef609fdb

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up **+11%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto twenty-eight months ago would be worth **$1,110** had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+95%** over the same time period - the initial $1k investment in crypto twenty-eight months ago is now worth **$1,955.**

That’s a difference of **$845** on a $1k investment in twenty-eight months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first six years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,560 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,660 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,290 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,090 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,580.**

That is up **+26%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+109%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined six year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&amp;P up to this point:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

This might not sound like the most grandiose of titles, but it does carry weight. Since Doge's inception, countless other meme coins have followed in Doge's footsteps (or pawsteps), including SHIB, Banano and DogelonMars. Whenever these coins receive attention, they are inevitably compared to Doge (in a similar way to how new non-meme coins are often compared to Bitcoin/Ethereum). This creates ever more visibility and demand for Doge, as it is seen as the Bitcoin of meme coins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Doge coin has had serious adoption. To name just a few places one can spend Doge coin, you can spend the meme coin at the Dallas Mavericks, ExpressVPN, Ledger, and airBaltic. That is more adoption than most serious coins. This sort of adoption, and potential for more adoption in the future, makes Doge coin a great investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, memes. The ability to create memes about a coin, without it seeming forced, is a non-trivial marketing tool. One can easily create extra traction and visibility for Doge, allowing Doge to welcome in new investors with ease. Often, other coins try this technique, but it seems insincere and a little on the nose. The ability to meme about a coin, especially in the social media age, is a feature that separates Doge from the rest of the pack.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to its decentralized nature and lack of reliance on intermediaries, Bitcoin has several other advantages over traditional fiat currencies; including a fixed supply, low transaction fees, and fast transaction times, among several others. \n&gt; \n&gt; # Decentralized\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is (or at least, aims to be) decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a singular authority or institution.\n&gt;    * This decentralized structure allows Bitcoin to operate without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, and [gives users greater control over their own assets.](https://forkast.news/why-decentralization-protect-user-data-privacy/)\n&gt; * One aspect is the geographical distribution of its miners, who [can be found all over the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bitcoin-mining-by-country).\n&gt;    * This global distribution ensures that the network is resistant to censorship and manipulation, as it is not dependent on any single locale or group of individuals.\n&gt; * In contrast, fiat currencies, such as the USD or the Euro, are controlled by the central banks and governments of their respective regions. \n&gt;    * This centralization can make them more vulnerable to the same manipulation and censorship, as their decision-makers are concentrated in a single location as opposed to being geographically and ideologically distributed.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Fast and Cheap\n&gt; \n&gt; * In comparison to traditional banking systems, Bitcoin's fees are significantly lower.\n&gt;    * [According to yCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee), the average fee for a Bitcoin transaction is currently around $1.1.\n&gt;    * This is significantly lower than the [fees charged by traditional banks](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/01/banks-charge-high-fees-because-there-is-no-real-competition.html) for processing transactions or holding funds, which can be several dollars or more, and can in certain cases scale depending on the size of a transaction.\n&gt;    * Bitcoin's relatively cheap fees are likely because it does not entail the physical movement of funds nor the use of expensive infrastructure, which also makes it inherently more scalable.\n&gt; * In terms of transaction speed, Bitcoin is also faster than mainstream payment methods.\n&gt;    * Transactions made using Bitcoin can be processed and verified [within a matter of minutes](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_confirmation_time), compared to the several days or even weeks that it can take for the latter.\n&gt; * Overall, the low fees and fast transaction times of Bitcoin make it a convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional banking and fiat currencies.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)).

This might not sound like the most grandiose of titles, but it does carry weight. Since Doge's inception, countless other meme coins have followed in Doge's footsteps (or pawsteps), including SHIB, Banano and DogelonMars. Whenever these coins receive attention, they are inevitably compared to Doge (in a similar way to how new non-meme coins are often compared to Bitcoin/Ethereum). This creates ever more visibility and demand for Doge, as it is seen as the Bitcoin of meme coins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Doge coin has had serious adoption. To name just a few places one can spend Doge coin, you can spend the meme coin at the Dallas Mavericks, ExpressVPN, Ledger, and airBaltic. That is more adoption than most serious coins. This sort of adoption, and potential for more adoption in the future, makes Doge coin a great investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, memes. The ability to create memes about a coin, without it seeming forced, is a non-trivial marketing tool. One can easily create extra traction and visibility for Doge, allowing Doge to welcome in new investors with ease. Often, other coins try this technique, but it seems insincere and a little on the nose. The ability to meme about a coin, especially in the social media age, is a feature that separates Doge from the rest of the pack.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

An approximated analysis of DOGE future price based on the current circulating supply,"# Disclaimer

This analysis has a lot of approximations and potentially many errors aka in the end in could be DOGE to 0 or DOGE to the moon and I have no idea. The numbers used in this analysis are obtained from Yahoo Finance Python APIs.

# Idea

Load the current Market Cap of ETH, BTC as well as the top tech industries (APPLE, GOOGLE, AMAZON ...) and see which value of DOGE would be needed to surpass (or match) their current total value.

# Market Caps (USD)

* META market cap: 695499358208
* AMZN market cap: 1285628231680
* AAPL market cap: 2824559919104
* NFLX market cap: 179390070784
* GOOG market cap: 1603958865920
* NVDA market cap: 967523696640
* MSFT market cap: 2497878425600
* TSLA market cap: 689714888704
* BTC-USD market cap: 500065435648
* ETH-USD market cap: 218972553216

# Let's play

If by hypothesis we freeze the circulating supply as today (but remember that in reality, it rises by 16 million every day), I emulated the Market Cap of doge for every price from 0.06 USD to 10 USD with $0.005 steps. I decided to compare it with the leading tech companies and the king and queen of cryptocurrencies. In addition, I also added a line with 1/10th of BTC's total value because my astrological prevision says that, at maximum, if people are \~stupid\~ crazy enough, DOGE could value max 1/10th of BTC market. And this is what I got (y axis is in log scale).

&amp;#x200B;

The vertical dashed lines are:

* 1/10\_BTC equals DOGE at price 0.3600
* NFLX equals DOGE at price 1.2850
* ETH-USD equals DOGE at price 1.5700
* BTC-USD equals DOGE at price 3.5850
* TSLA equals DOGE at price 4.9400
* META equals DOGE at price 4.9850
* NVDA equals DOGE at price 6.9300
* AMZN equals DOGE at price 9.2100

At $0.36 USD, it would be equivalent to 1/10th of BTC. Any other price, such as 'DOGE to $1 rocket emoji', seems highly improbable, as at $1 USD, it would be nearing the value of Netflix. However, my question is, are there any arbitrarily large groups of people willing to invest a total of $40 billion or even $170 billion? I don't think so (and I hope not, since I sold mine last week at a loss, RIP).",0,12,2023-06-06 11:35:03,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('[deleted]', 1), ('A market cap of 40B wouldn’t mean that people have put $40B in doge though', 2), (""We really need to stop using actual companies/stocks as a comparison, doesn't really work that way"", -2), ('[deleted]', 0), ('[deleted]', -1), ('Might be more useful whenever we know when Elon tweets about Doge again.', 0), ('[deleted]', -1), ('Once again, comparing the market caps of any cryptocurrency with stocks is deeply flawed', 0), ('But I want to feel bullish and am willing to accept a fundamentally flawed point of view!', 0), ('Doge piggybacked off of Elon Musk and the meme stock frenzy of ‘21.

Comparing the seven day charts for some of the subs favorites - why are some able to bounce back better than others?,"How have the subs favorite cryptos and BTC fared during this troubling week of RED?

BTC bounced right back up near it's previous levels, still down a bit from seven days ago but nothing to bad considering everything that is happening in the crypto world.

ETH also bounced back up pretty quick, wasn't declared a security so it seems fine.

APE bounced back stronger than most. I guess the APE coin community is pretty strong to be able to do this when other more established crypto currencies are struggling.

What does it mean if a coin/token is able to bounce right back up after a day filled with bad news?

are the coins/tokens that stayed at the bottom only going to go lower?

Will ALGO and ADA continue to fall?

Who is still buying SOL?

46% of the Top 15 Tokens now Defined as Securities by SEC,"When removing all stable coins but BUSD, since that was named by the SEC, 46% of the top 15 tokens by market cap have been labelled a security. Here are the notable exceptions:

* BTC -&gt; Obvious as SEC has said explicitly its a commodity
* ETH -&gt; SEC has not said it directly but has avoided labelling ETH a security when pushed even by congress.
* STETH -&gt; Likely will be lumped in with ETH
* DOGE -&gt; Not sure why DOGE has avoided this other than its creators created it as a joke and abandoned it until recently and reinvigorating the ""non-profit"" DOGE foundation. Also, ironically, explicitly being labelled as a joke by the creators kinda blows the Howey test out of the water since there was no expectation of profit, it was explicitly communicated to not invest in this, and it was only the haphazard community which initially formed around it that kept it going. So the ironic unintended consequence of being a joke in a weird way might have made it into a commodity rather than a security. DOGE is an interesting one. I don't own any cause I still think it's a crap coin and I'd rather have BTC. But still ... interesting.
* LTC -&gt; Another interesting one. Again, doesn't have a very centralised presence. Just the non-profit foundation. This could be seen as centralised enough since the foundation could be considered the ""governing body"" which directs development and thus the 4 elements of the Howey Test might apply.
* DOT -&gt; Probably the most interesting since, of all the projects, DOT has come out and explicitly and publicly declared it is no longer a Security and has morphed into distributed software and the DOT token is a commodity used to interact with the software. DOT is fully decentralised with a unique distributed governing structure or DAO. While Parity is the primary developer it cannot unilaterally update the chain and all updates must go through DOT's decentralised governance; moreover, anyone can put forward chain updates to be voted on so even the development itself is decentralised.  One would think, of all the tokens, the SEC would want to take on DOT due to its explicit declaration in Nov. 2022 that it is NOT a security and in a way the Web3 Foundation thumbing their nose at the SEC .... unless it agrees with the Web3 Foundation ... 🧐 ... or at the very least SECs capitulation that you can't litigate an organisation which has no control over the product ... hmmmmm ... sounds like a commodity.
* AVAX -&gt; I'm going 50/50 on this one. Its development is fairly centralised and there is a lack of clear decentralised government, but, so far, it's a notable outlier and has some interesting characteristics ... but ... does it be a the Howey Test?
* SHIB -&gt; Super centralised project. Total security.

Here\'s the reasoning behind each selection:\n\n1. Bulbasaur - Ethereum: Both Bulbasaur and Ethereum are considered foundational and versatile. Bulbasaur starts with a strong foundation as a grass/poison type, just like Ethereum, which is a widely used blockchain platform for various decentralized applications.\n\n2. Charizard - Bitcoin (BTC): Charizard is a powerful and iconic Pokémon, much like Bitcoin is a well-known and influential cryptocurrency in the crypto world.\n\n3. Pikachu - Dogecoin (DOGE): Pikachu is one of the most recognizable Pokémon, and Dogecoin, with its mascot being the Shiba Inu dog, has gained popularity for its fun and meme-like nature.\n\n4. Gyarados - Cardano (ADA): Gyarados is a water/dragon type known for its strength and resilience. Similarly, Cardano aims to provide a secure and robust platform for building decentralized applications and has gained attention for its scientific and academically rigorous approach.\n\n5. Mewtwo - Ripple (XRP): Mewtwo is a powerful and unique Pokémon, and Ripple, represented by XRP, has been known for its enterprise-oriented solutions and partnerships with traditional financial institutions.\n\n6. Jolteon - Litecoin (LTC): Jolteon is an electric-type Pokémon, reflecting the speed and efficiency of Litecoin, often considered the silver to Bitcoin\'s gold, as it offers faster transaction confirmation times.\n\n7. Zapdos - Ethereum Classic (ETC): Zapdos is an electric/flying type Pokémon, and Ethereum Classic is the original version of Ethereum, symbolizing the ""classic"" nature of this blockchain.\n\n8. Dragonite - Polkadot (DOT): Dragonite is a dragon/flying type Pokémon known for its ability to connect different regions. Similarly, Polkadot aims to connect various blockchains and enable interoperability between them.\n\n9. Vaporeon - Chainlink (LINK): Vaporeon is a water-type Pokémon, and Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts with real-world data sources.\n\n10. Snorlax - Binance Coin (BNB): Snorlax is known for its sleep and restfulness, and Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, which offers various services including staking and savings.', 1), (""I would say 99.9% of altcoins would be Magikarp, as they're pointless and don't do anything."", 5), ('If you pick the right one you get a gyrados though.

"The bear market is doing an adequate job cleansing the crypto space of bad projects and actors. Although it is a painful experience now, this cleansing is great for crypto's future","During the bull market, people often proclaimed that the bear market will cleanse the crypto space. Now that we are deep in bear territory, a popular opinion here is that the bear market did not do its job of cleansing this space. For instance, there was a post on this a little over a month ago when shitcoins were popping off

https://preview.redd.it/1vtnvi07715b1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4424647fdedfa4694e01eaa17430bff61808168f

It is true that we have not gotten rid of *all* the shitty projects. However, I would argue that the bear market HAS cleansed this space of a lot of garbage.

# A lot of the bad projects are down a ton

* HEX dropped 99%
* FTT dropped 99%
* Luna dropped 100%
* Algo dropped 96% \[yes, I count this one. It had 500%+ inflation in 2021. Sorry.\]
* Shib dropped 92%
* Doge dropped 93%
* A lot of the NFTs (like pictures of rocks or monkeys) are now $0
* All the other shitcoins that popped off earlier this year are also down a lot. PEPE dropped 79% from the high, for instance.

# A ton of bad actors have been removed from this space

* FTX is gone, taking a lot of bad actors with it, such as SBF and Caroline Ellison
* Do Kwon is gone
* The Celsius ponzi scheme died and with it Alex Mashinsky lost a lot of influence
* The Three Arrows Capital ponzi scheme died
* A lot of small exchanges died that mishandled user funds

&amp;#x200B;

Is there still too much money shinvested in bad projects? Yep.

Was the process of cleansing this space painful? For sure. RIP our portfolios.

Gensler sues American Kennel Club for promoting dogs,"Gary Gensler at the SEC announced today a new lawsuit against the American Kennel Club (AKC). The suit alleges that the Kennel Club played the major role in promoting and breeding Shiba Inu’s and other dogs, from which a large number of crypto tokens - unregistered securities - have been inspired and developed. These have included Dogecoin, Baby Doge, BONK, Nano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Safe Inu, ‘and a bunch of other shitcoins.’ Gensler was quoted as saying, “their dogs may be cute, but the Kennel Club needs to come in, sit down with us and register their organization if they want to keep breeding and showing canines, particularly the Inu varieties, as they’ve been the main reason that the evil of crypto meme coins even exists.” “These coins and tokens have bred out of control, much like the mongrels that the American Kennel Club loves so much. They need to start taking responsibility for misleading the American public by pretending that they don’t have a role in this.”


In response, a confused AKC had immediately delisted Shiba Inu breed from its list of recognized dogs, and announced that they would be moving their headquarters to the United Arab Emirates.",1,0,2023-06-10 16:08:17,,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY,"[('Bearish on security dogs.

"Well, at least after all this doom and gloom we can not say anymore that Crypto is boring. You get free entertainment everyday here.","As said, the action and explosiveness of the past days can not be put into simple words, we had everything from starting to think we are recovering at over $28k to the SEC news bombshell dropping and slowly increasing per day until we hit a tipping point where Robinhood delisted Crypto assets, causing up to 20% drops for assets like DOGE, MATIC, SOL and ADA.

With all of those news development there is one thing Crypto has not been over the past days and that is, boring. We may have been on the peak of anxiety over the past days, but still at least we felt something. Other than the sluggish price movement we had over the past two to three months.

Well now we can obviously also say that we only got that kind of excitement on the expense on the losses of us all and especially some sub-favourite alts like ALGO, MATIC and ATOM collapsing to -20%. But guess the game is the game and we are having surely som fun right now.

"Since SEC is suing everybody, which Cryptocurrencies or assets consider to be not a security?","There are uncertainly in the Crypto Markets because SEC has considered many cryptos as securities and suing popular exchanges like Coinbase and [Binance.US](https://Binance.US).  Both definitions of securities and commodities are confusing when applying to Crypto that even SEC has difficulty giving clear guidance.

### What is not a security?

* Currency
* A check (whether or not certified), draft, bill of exchange, or bank letter of credit
* A note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in a mercantile or consumer, rather than an investment, transaction
* An interest in a deposit account with a bank or a savings and loan association
* An insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract under which an insurance company promises to pay money either in a lump sum or periodically for life or for some other specified period

### Common characteristics of unregistered securities:

* They are represented as safe investments.
* They are represented as no risk investments.
* They are represented as guaranteed return investments.
* They offer returns on investment that are greater than the prevailing market.
* The sales commissions paid to sales agents are much higher than for traditional products.

This sums up the UI experience using cdc in the last 4 years.,"Curious as to what lol things other people see on a daily basis. By far using kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, cashapp, to buy and move crypto. By far and away the most horrible customer service, UI, prices, prices on the buy and sell side. 

&amp;#x200B;

example :  if you are buying anything but CRO using cdc, they charge an absurd fee + you paying wayyyyyy above \*true price\*. The single and only reason I have ever used CDC at all is for Cro. Absolutely one of the most sus places to place a buy order in a bull run is [crypto.co](https://crypto.com)m. surprisingly the ui is absolutely unchanged from me calling out their third world programming, they call derivative, up down options. Jesus Christ please come back and bathe the world in fire that is so fucking stupid. But I digress. Kinda excited about this little dip on the market. Just thought I would ask what funny, stupid, or actually concerning issues to you see as it relates to the platforms you use.

&amp;#x200B;

for example on cdc. You need about 100k in equity in the USA to be using the exchange. If you are not using the exchange you had better be up 40% from your initial purchase. Minimum. 40% they shill the fuckkkkkkk out of the buy and sell side on every single thing on that pos app. I used to love making the example of what 1 eth would cost you on kraken, Coinbase, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com),  Gemini. by far and away. The absolute worst place. The most Becky place as I call it for anyone to buy eth, btc, xlm, anything. Was always cdc. Kraken has beat prices from my experience. Preferred platform by far.

Does all this commotion get you excited for crypto even more? I’m more excited and nervous than ever. Feels like it’s either the bottom or the top from here … ready to strap in!,"A bit if background: I got into crypto with the doge boost a few years backand hold a meager amount compared to many of you here. I have followed the ecosystem relatively closely, tried to keep up with (slightly) understanding tech, keeping away from scams, watching the market etc etc. - all to a slight degree - at least trying to keep abreast of topics enough to have more nuanced convos about the crypto world.

Anyways - from my cursory knowledge, it feels like this could be a make or break moment truly. I know it has been said before, but in the past it was with one coin, or one exchange, but right now it’s all sort of blowing up - it’s hard not to see it as the dominos falling. 

But with all that - i can’t help but think of the old adage “all news is good news” and how if crypto can withstand this - and can show WHY it’s still worth while - it could usher in a whole new era of crypto users.

**I guess if I had a question it would be:** what do you think could be the best outcome possible for cryptocurrency more generally, given all the heavy handed negative sentiment lately?

Сrypto contest,"Hello everyone! I apologize in advance for any errors and inappropriate language as the text was translated using a translator. I am conducting a contest among crypto communities. The contest involves solving a task that consists of three parts. The first 10 people to solve it will share the prize among themselves. The task will be posted on June 26, 2023. To participate in the contest, you will need to transfer any amount to any of the crypto wallet addresses listed below (only transfer from the addresses that you are willing to receive rewards in case you win). The prize will consist of the collected funds.

Contest Plan:

1) Announce the contest on various platforms.

2) In case of interest, conduct a survey on which messengers would be more convenient to publish polls and information about the contest.

3) Conduct a survey on whether the task will be posted in the 0 time zone or will be adjusted to different time zones.

4) Post the task.

5) Publish a report on the transferred funds to the winners.

6) Conduct a small survey among the winners, and with their consent, post the survey results in groups.

To be honest, I am interested in knowing which regions the winners will be from and how they will manage their funds. I will also receive a portion of the funds (the prize will be divided into 11 parts, 10 parts will be rounded up for the contest winners, and the remainder will be left with me. I plan to spend a portion of the remainder on charity and a portion on additional education and subsequent project implementation). I will check messages periodically and respond to comments.

Why can't we just succeed slightly?,"As the title reads - Why can't the people that put in their hard earned money, get at least something back from Crypto/coin investments?

Is it really too much to ask for?

Over the years, I've come to realise that crypto investments are genuinlely just not for anyone with any money.

I've invested a fair share over the past few years, but I've gained nothing, actually lost money.

If I leave my money, why can't it just grow? Give me fucking 1% per month if anything. The volatility is actually just pure socialist bullshit. I feel foolish that I took this whole crypto thing with any slight possible seriousness at all. I'm 100% certain that this has to be the general consensus. There are literally millions of posts in the same realm.

Take these last few days, let's take Solana, for example. Now a lot of people bash Solana for ""downtime"". Okay? Cool. But then the SEC makes some random decision to label it a security. Again, okay? Why? Does it even fucking matter? Why is the okay? Why does every little thing affect crypto.

The wind blows - Eth goes down.
Elon shits his pants on twitter about Doge = cataclysmic investment failure.
Someone says some random shit about Crypto = fluctuation.
Whales = OWN THE MARKET. Fuck off if you disagree, you're an idiot.

Etc. Etc.

Why are we even doing this? Cause we wanna make some extra money I guess, or we believe in a world with true monetary decentralisation. The latter sounds cool, but will cost you all your money it seems.

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December 2021 I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

Top Crypto Subreddits by Size,"Below is a table of the largest crypto subreddits by size. This is a gauge of how much these coins/tokens and crypto related items have a community on Reddit. However, this is probably not a good indicator of active community as some of these subreddits are much older with people joining over time and then not interacting with the sub any more.

There are a few large subreddits that are related to a single coin such as ethereum/shib. I have tried to find all the major crypto subreddits but I am sure I missed a few. I have also included some that are general and not specific to a coin such as this very sub. Some subs were shown as the same number of subscribers so I shared the same rank (eg, the btc and BitcoinBeginners sub both had 1.1 million).

I could not obtain some subreddit sizes as the subs have become private such as:

* /r/Stellar
* /r/blockchain

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 4th monthly report for the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JUNE Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for almost 5.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/)***.***
* **MAY Highlights:** \- **XRP** easily wins the month, followed by **Litecoin. Bitcoin** is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by **XRP** and **ETH** in second place.
* The 2023 portfolio is +32% so far this year. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&amp;P 500 over the same time period (see below for details).
* **New feature:** for the first time this year, my Top Ten edges total market cap token **AMKT** out for a monthly victory, but overall is still leading +56% vs. the Top Ten's +32% in 2023 in this year’s friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**). 

## Month Five – Up +32%

https://preview.redd.it/9h2kr3h6z66b1.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8952cd32ad73bd0e3f1821c648b5debbe5205092

The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC.**

May highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:

* For the second month in a row, the 2023 Top Ten drops modestly – but back to back losses are enough to land the Portfolio back to January levels of ROI.
* **XRP** easily outperformed the field in May (+9%), followed by **Litecoin.**  The rest either maintained or lost ground.
* **Bitcoin** holds on to the lead so far in 2023, followed by **XRP** and **ETH** in second place.

## May Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks five months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/1gzrx6o8z66b1.png?width=295&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afce2767b080e05383e8183d8c1335a8c4c5c3d0

Remarkably steady so far during the five months of 2023, with only **BUSD** dropping out of the original portfolio, replaced by **SOL**.

## May Winner and Loser

***May Winner*** –  **XRP** easily outperformed its peers, up +9% in May.

***May Loser*** – **DOT**, down -10%, was the worst performing crypto of the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio this month.

## Overall Update: BTC maintains lead, XRP and ETH move into second place, all crypto still in the green for the year, barely.

Every crypto in this year’s Experiment is still in positive territory, although **DOGE** is very close to being the first in the Top Ten Portfolio to get back down to the break even point. It is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, barely in the green at +2% for the year.

For the second month in a rown, **BTC** holds on to the top spot after overtaking **MATIC** for the lead [two months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3). The initial $100 invested in **BTC** five months ago is worth $162 today. 

**XRP** and **ETH** are next, +55% since New Year’s Day.  

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/ubw14u5az66b1.png?width=337&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532a5c8c9a06e66b7d36653a498fb5ca10f2fb82

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio lost $45 in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$1,317.** 

At +32%, the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio is at its lowest month end ROI of the year. Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/tc2zfubbz66b1.png?width=241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06c44d7b06531581d51b09fbd9bc39b972e59e41

## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).

**New feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 5+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index.  Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

Here’s the question I’m tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.  Five months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/bwcd1oqcz66b1.png?width=513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a9f19fbdfad9c23f7ac701d08d0a805869556b0

**May Performances:**

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**: -3% 
* **AMKT**: -4%

For the first time in 2023, the monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolio.**

**Overall since January 1st, 2023:** 

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $1,317 (+32%) 
* **AMKT:** current value $1,560 (+56%)

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/cgzck9zdz66b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4872087c7cf14820cfd72249bb5704fca3e8d5fa

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2023 Top Ten is one of six concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -37% (total value $628)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +229% (total value $3,286)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +379% (total value $4,788) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +87% (total value $1,870)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -70% (total value $299) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +32% (total value $1,317)

Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$12,188.** 

**That’s up +103%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/kkqnie8fz66b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=657679410e8a6a85b6734763e6cb3c96aa9d8ee7

In summary: ***That’s a +103% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/19hyvuggz66b1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb66d67ec530dde7afad7db50de03e75526a6074

The S&amp;P 500 is up +10% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,100 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,580 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,680 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,310 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,120 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $890 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,100 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,680.**

That is up **+28%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+103%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

Tuzki Eth is making its way into world of Crypto memes. New Shiba &amp; Doge in the Making,[removed],1,0,2023-06-15 19:11:37,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]

"TuzkiEth, new meme token, with the potential to rival Doge and Shiba"," 

Hello Reddit and Crypto Meme Lovers.

Get ready for a crazy twist in the Tuzki universe! You all know Tuzki, that adorable bunny meme that makes us laugh, right? Well, here's the deal: Tuzki now has its very own token called TuzkiEth on the Ethereum blockchain. And guess what? The original creator is completely clueless about it! Can you believe the bunny drama that's about to unfold? 😂

Let me fill you in on the details: While the Tuzki creator was busy spreading joy with their cute bunny, some sneaky crypto enthusiasts decided to create TuzkiEth—a token that's gaining popularity faster than Tuzki munches on carrots!

Now, before you start worrying about any legal stuff, let's just assume that the original creator is cool with this unexpected turn of events. I mean, who wouldn't want their meme to have its very own crypto, right? It's like Tuzki is taking over the financial world one hop at a time!

But hey, just in case the original creator feels left out or confused, let's show them some love. How about rewarding them with some Tuzki tokens? It's only fair, considering that Tuzki's success wouldn't have been possible without their initial brilliance. So, let's spread the word and suggest this idea to the TuzkiEth creators. Maybe they could send a cool bunny-themed care package with carrots, Tuzki plushies, and a bunch of Tuzki tokens. It's a win-win situation!

Imagine this: Tuzki and TuzkiEth teaming up like the ultimate bunny duo. Tuzki continues to make us laugh with its funny expressions, while TuzkiEth takes us on an exciting crypto adventure. We could trade Tuzki-themed NFTs, swap tokens like bunnies hopping around, and who knows, maybe even have a Tuzki-themed decentralized exchange. The possibilities are endless, just like Tuzki's cuteness!

Remember, this post is all in good fun. We're here to enjoy the hilarity and embrace the chaos. Let's unite as a community and see where this TuzkiEth journey takes us!

Mining in an apartment,"Hello. I have a question about mining. In the event of free electricity in a unit, is mining possible?

For example, a miner with lower wattage. I figured that wouldn't be as detectable. Also, it wouldn't put off as much heat.

I don't know how to do this yet, but I'd like to run a lower wattage miner and try and figure out how to harness the heat to heat a tropical fish tank. I don't know if this fish tank idea is practical, just an idea.

Anyways, would a lower wattage miner raise suspicions?

Has anyone been an a rental that allowed free electricity, and you mined?

They are 260W and under. Would something like that be alright you think?

Decoding Mining and Masternodes: Different Approaches to Blockchain Rewards,"I've been diving deep into the world of blockchain mining lately and I'm fascinated by the different reward mechanisms used. From PoW to PoS and even variants like DPoS, it's a complex landscape.

Mining and Masternodes are two different approaches to rewarding participants in a blockchain network. Let's explore each of them in detail:  

**Mining** is the process of validating and adding new transactions to a blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. Miners use powerful computing hardware to compete against each other to find the solution first. The first miner to solve the problem receives the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency coins as a reward for their efforts. This process is known as proof-of-work.

**Best Cryptos to Mine in 2023**

1. Monero (XMR) 
2. Litecoin (LTC) 
3. Ethereum Classic (ETC) 
4. Dogecoin (DOGE) 
5. Zcash (ZEC) 

**Masternodes** are a type of full node in a blockchain network that perform additional functions beyond transaction validation. They often provide advanced services like instant transactions, privacy features, and decentralized governance. Masternodes require a significant investment in cryptocurrency to operate, as a collateral amount of coins is typically required to participate. 

**Best Masternode Cryptocurrencies in 2023**

Dashpay - Ability to empower individuals through swift and confidential transactions. Most SAFU passive income play with an airtight crypto community.

Morpheus.Network - Revolutionizing the global supply chain market through blockchain technology, enhancing transparency and efficiency. Newest SAFU node out of the lot with a very high ROI.

Vechain - Transforming industries with its blockchain-based solutions for supply chain management. It gives a very low ROI but has a very big community making it extremely SAFU.

Horizon - Fostering privacy and security in the digital world, offering a decentralized platform for secure communications and transactions. Good ROI with a low MC, which increases its growth potential.

These two systems do not overlap, as no mining takes place on masternode computers nor can a mining computer run a masternode. All of the miners and the masternode owners are members of the blockchain community and their work and support provide the financial strength to the blockchain network. Now which one you want to pick depends on the different range of distribution of rewards both.

Elon Musk should be charged with market manipulation,"This is a popular concept on Reddit but let me provide a reason no one is talking about: Elon Musk promoted doge because he ""likes dogs and memes"" and thinks that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. 

""Entertaining"" to who? Was it entertaining to late-but-not-too-late crypto tech investors who didn't profit enough from their legitimate investments to avoid eating ramen in 2022 and 2023? Was it entertaining to the people who built actual technical advancements in cryptocurrency tech and markets that have gone underfunded over the last 3 years?

To him, flexing his financial might is the most entertaining outcome, as he cripples crypto tech investors on their journey to financial freedom. 

How does he do this? 

Well, as we know, he pumps the sh*t out of the expensive, outdated, slow-to-confirm, hyperinflationary dogcrap coin and pretends that it is somehow better than the projects that actually mean to redesign the global financial system. He is a villain to all crypto tech investors. 

Let me take you back in time to October 2020. Doge is $0.0025 with a market cap of $350M. Elon had talked about it for a while, here and there, but he begins to really pump the name. Most of his audience doesn't know what a market cap even is but they want to make money and are the FOMO buyers that will lift the crypto market to its eventual all time highs. 

What he doesn't include in his analysis is the fact that doge requires millions of dollars of capital inflows every week to keep itself afloat. Every single day 14.4M doge enter circulation. Forever. Every day... forever. It literally never stops. At $0.06, with each of those 14.4M entering circulation (which is not necessarily what happens, btw, but it is important to consider), the market needs to offer $850K worth of support. That's each and every day and doesn't include sales of circulating supply. 

Now, let's jump to May 2021, the month when doge hit its all-time high. Its market cap was over $85B. (Only a handful of coins have ever reached that number and freakin' doge was one of them 🤨🤯😵.)

Let's take a second to clarify how market cap works: it doesn't take $85B of capital injection for the market cap to grow to $85B. There's actual math that exists to specify the exact number but for simplicity's sake, I always divide it by 10. Whether or not that is correct, let's look at it from that perspective:

For doge to jump to $85B requires $8.5B of capital being injected. 

Now let's add in shib, as it never would have mooned like it did without doge doing what it did: shib went from $0 to $40B, which means roughly $4B went into it.

Total: $12.5B extracted from the market (and in addition to that, the money from the other memes that mooned too hard and the whole meme coin fiasco that has since developed on the back of it)

Now consider this: in the heat of the 2021 bullrun, at around $45K iirc, there was a study that came out that stated that $90M was required to move the price of BTC by 1%. That means that every $1B of net capital injections was worth about 10% to the price of BTC. Now, take the reckless financial decisions of millions of dog coin investors and instead put that money into more prudent places like BTC and other top-10, -20, and -50 coins and it becomes obvious that the $12.5B+ (plus the carryover of momentum to safemoon and other dog and ""safe"" and ""moon"" and similar coins/tokens) and it is obvious that Elon Musk alone is responsible for cutting the Bitcoin bull run by maybe as much as 100%.

Imagine that... all of the moons this sub earns for ""$100K BTC 2021"" comments would probably never have been earned if not for the self-proclaimed dogefather. Someone find Elon's Reddit account so everyone can send him a thank you tip 🤫.

These are serious financial crimes that should not be ignored by regulators and I as a God-fearing man believe that they will not be ignored by God either -- Jesus once said that a camel has a better chance of fitting through the eye of a needle than a rich man has of entering the Kingdom of God and I have to assume Elon's callous disregard for everyday people will guarantee him inclusion in the category of the rich men who never enter the Kingdom. 

This man proposed an alternative to the true financial instruments of the future, an alternative that is quite literally a joke that was never designed to be an investment vehicle and/or everyday currency... and he did this because his autistic brain thought it was funny.  

Let me repeat that:

He thinks it's funny to F with people's financial realities. How out-of-touch can a person be? The man is sick. He should be reviled. He should be forced to make restitution to non-doge/shib crypto investors and then he should be put in prison.",0,25,2023-06-21 19:06:43,,CryptoCurrency,DEBATE,"[(""Doge isn't an investment, it's a meme."", 1), ('No. Stop smoking.', -2), (""Obviously he's broken the law many times, including with market manipulation, but he's the richest man in the planet so laws don't exist for him."", 1), ('Better yet, the people that got into this meme coin and got manipulated should be charged.', 0), ('How does that make sense?', -1), ('Crypto being unregulated plays a big role here, he got fucked well when he tried to pull same shit with tesla stock if ya remember.

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December 2021 I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

Crypto.com CRO app investment strategy,"I stopped investing in the app a few months before the eth merge. The income for the investments came from my small (21-25 GPUs on two rigs) GPU farm (still running today). Also was able to aquired enough coins (over 5000) to get two NFT's.

traded doge I earned from a video game (passive income) at the ATH and for CRO and parked it into defi and sold all interest as it was aquired, doing some unstakes here and there to restake into atom mostly.

Selling the crypto mostly covers my whole term life insurance payment which is close to maturing and a credit card I havent used for 4 years.

As it stands I have funds locked in about 8 defi projects for four years that feel like its bottom, all of which have lost more than half of its value since I invested in them...

Should I sell my mining equipment? I treat it like a loan from my power company in the summer and heat in the winter and I've spent the crypto winter making them as easy to maintain as a water heater ( many years of monitoring, trial and error)

Did I do good? Should I go back?

I'm not sure of what to think about that. Technically, it would make much more sense for Elon Musk to talk about Moons than Doge. Space X powered by Moons....let's go to the moon, bla bla bla.

Surprising list: The top 5 coins by marketcapitalization without VC tokens.,"#The next cycle will be about utility

If my assessment is correct the next cycle will be about privacycoins as well as OG POW coins that simply work because of cheap transaction fees and better coin distribution which means they are less prone to manipulation (read: less inflatable without real USD) compared to (premined) VC tokens where supply is highly concentrated and controlled by only a few hands.

It will be fun to watch projects that have actual utility today rise to the top again while VC tokens comparatively stagnate.

What should be your exit strategy...,"So as the new market cycle is near, and we all want our coins to moon. People talk about DCA strategy, bottom buying aka bottom fishing. Mr X want's to talk about exit strategy. Mr X has been in the crypto market for a fair amount of time. So around 2017, Mr. X had bought 100k Dogecoin at a quit cheap price. He spent around 150$. Didn't think much at that time, Doge was a fork of Litecoin and one of the earliest coin which was with BTC. The thought at that time was pretty simple. Mr X missed BTC , so why not try to catch the next BTC. So Doge slept for few years and suddenly one day Doge woke up. Mr X also woke up and couldn't believe his eyes seeing a 100% increase within 24hrs. Mr X did not had any exit strategy. He did not sell it then, thinking it will go higher. He was not wrong , after a pause doge went higher. Mr X did not sell thinking he waited again for it to go higher. He was getting a good money. Even if he would have sold 70-80% of his holding, he would have made 30,000$ easily. He thought to wait for more gains. He became greedy. Then Doge finished it's run and profit taking started, but Mr X was still waiting. Doge lost its zero. Came back hard, Mr X panicked and slowly started selling, thinking probably he will not make any profit. He sold all of his Doge. Did he make profit ? Yes, but not what he could have made if he would had a good exit strategy. At one time he would have made 40k$ but now he made only 2000-3000k . So guys don't be Mr X, have a good exit strategy. If you are making a good amount of money, sell 50-70% of your holding, don't worry,  market will bleed, you will get the opportunity to buy it again at a discounted price. Mr X told me to pass this advice.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the seventeenth monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JUNE Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** 
* **MAY Highlights:** \- **XRP** easily wins the month, followed by **ETH** in second place. Rest of the coins well in the red. 2022 group worst performing Top Ten Portfolio, by far.
* DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&amp;P 500 over the same time period (see below for details).

## Month Seventeen – Down -70%

https://preview.redd.it/ha57jd5xqd8b1.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e0a1b5b59b40a1058dec46a2c26fb12cf4830d

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

May highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **ETH** finish the month in postive territory, the other eight severely in the red.
* **XRP** passes **BNB** to claim first place, down -40% and -41% respectively.
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the six [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -70% as a whole.

## May Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking seventeen months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/ddfaqrkyqd8b1.png?width=333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a550810e73cff42b5fa58ac18ffff219f7874c45

**AVAX, DOT,** and **LUNC** have dropped out, replaced by **Litecoin, DOGE,** and **MATIC.**  

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** –  **XRP** (+9%) easily won in May, followed by **ETH** (+1%).

***May Losers*** – Terra coins **UST** and **LUNC** performed horribly this month, down -34% and -22% respectively.

## Overall Update: XRP overtakes BNB for the lead. All cryptos well in negative territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

**XRP** (-40%) overtook **BNB** (-41%) this month to claim first position. Not far behind is **BTC**, down -43%.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** seventeen months ago is worth $0.0001 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the six Top Ten Experiments, by far.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of the 2022. 

At -70%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the six [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/swjw96o5rd8b1.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2a98cd58bb09a6479b10b4f7ac5ae236ecb3747

Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -70%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$299.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/j0ohwsz7rd8b1.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e64d5992093a1bd2331bf6aad6b719645c3a40d

As you can see, there hasn’t been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/). The value has remained in the -66% to -80% range since [May 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5).  

## A note on USDC/UST

In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019 and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies.  As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST then staking with Anchor.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $0.001, down -100%.

It’s a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

## Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended May at 46.1%. For context, that’s exactly the same percentage as one year ago, in May of 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/ume5nak9rd8b1.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ca92564d4c5cf537dc636116b40a8f2503898f4

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -37% (total value $628)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +229% (total value $3,286)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +379% (total value $4,788) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +87% (total value $1,870)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -70% (total value $299) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +32% (total value $1,317)

Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$12,188.** 

**That’s up +103%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/cl26fu3crd8b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bed70be223ab7dae4105a96e86092a898915a32

In summary: ***That’s a +103% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/uhycuc7drd8b1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b7e7f665ea509b338b935591004d1808697515

The S&amp;P 500 is down -11% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $890 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,580 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,680 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,310 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,120 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $890 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,100 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,680.**

That is up **+28%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+103%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you’ll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiment.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

What makes a coin popular? (Spoiler: it is not tech or utility),"BTC...ETH...doge.. ADA...what makes a coin popular? 



















Is it the technology behind them?



















I for one know a few things about the blockchain tech. Not as much as I like tbh. Why? There are so many of them. And I am not a coder or a net expert. And guess what? Neither are the whales nor your average investors. 
For us ""fully decentralized proof of work third generation blockchain with advanced sharding"" is just an excuse to tell ourselves what we have invested in is not stupid.


















Is it what they call utility? Now that's a fancy word isn't it? But what it really means?
Does it mean ""possible use cases?"". If it is, we need to know about technical aspects which we don't. 
And even if a coinhas great utility, does it really means anything if that coin is not used for that utility?








So maybe adoption should be considered along with utility? But then again, a coin might lose all of its ""utilities"" overnight. Like CEL. 























So what makes a coin attractive for people?
One would argue that more often than not it is the price action. 
I love ALGO, I hold big bags of it, but it brought me nothing but losses and suffering. It is great in every bloody way except the price action. 
And let's face it, there are two types of crypto investors. Those who are here for the money, and lying sacks of shit.  


















So yes. The most attractive property of a coin is its ability to bring back profits (yes, I know we are in a bear market. There are coins with great price action even in this market.)
And for a coin to achieve that, there should be decent tokenomics, a healthy dose of investments, and enough public attention. 
And the public only knows about the later. 




















There goes the reason why so many people charge mindlessly to buy the latest overhyped pyramid scheme shitcoin. And why at least for now it is not enough to be a solid, useful, secure coin in this circus. 
Unless you are ready to ""buy and forget"".

"What coins would be included in an ""Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF?"" I'm asking because I think we really need one.","
I've been a part of this subreddit for a few years now and it has become clear to me that we, as a whole, are terrible at predicting successful projects. In years past, we have collectively praised NANO, LTC, VET, ALGO, EOS, BAT, ICX and countless other cryptos. Some of these did well, some did incredibly well for a bit, some did not do well at all.. 
However, some of the coins this sub has spent many posts completely shitting on have done amazingly well. These would include: SOL, PEPE, DOGE, BCH, SHIB, TRX and many others. 

How is it that we are so bad at this? What can we do to change??

I think an imaginary “Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF” would be a fun experiment to determine whether or not our brains are working against us. If we could put together a collection of the most hated coins in the sub, what would that look like? How would it perform? What do you think should be included in it? 

*Note: Before anyone jumps in to say “wHaT ABouT BTc anD ETh?!?” or something dumb like that: this post isn’t about those two. They aren’t part of this conversation.

Elon Musk announces he's suing Reddit for Intellectual Property theft after Reddit begins selling blue checkmark NFTs. [Satire],"**What Happened:**

Late last year, Elon Musk began selling Twitters famous blue Check Mark for $8 a month. The check mark that was once synonymous with prestige on Twitter, has lost a lot of meaning as a status symbol. With Reddit selling Check Mark NFT's, this once famous symbol stands to lose even more value for Twitter Blue Subscribers.

In order to protect the value for Twitter Blue Subscribers, Elon Musk has taken to Twitter to announce he'll be suing Reddit for Intellectual Property (IP) Theft, in the following string of Tweets. He then stated if Reddit wants to continue selling check mark NFTs they'll need to buy Twitter first, but they could pay in Dogecoin for half off.

Of Course Reddit had to respond to these statements.

Kitty Meme Coin,"  

The cryptocurrency industry has been a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. However, a new player has entered the game: meme coins. And one meme coin, in particular, is making headlines – Kitty Meme Coin.

Kitty Meme Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the popular internet meme of cats. The coin has been gaining popularity in recent months, with many investors seeing it as a potential new player in the cryptocurrency industry. Some have even gone so far as to predict that Kitty Meme Coin is going to win the meme coin industry.

So why has Kitty Coin been gaining so much attention? One reason is its unique branding. The coin is marketed as a fun, lighthearted cryptocurrency that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. This approach has resonated with many investors, who are drawn to the idea of a cryptocurrency that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Another reason for Kitty Meme Coin's popularity is its strong community. The coin has a dedicated group of supporters who are passionate about its success. This community has helped to spread the word about Kitty Coin and has even developed its own online forums and social media channels.

But can Kitty Coin really win the meme coin industry? That remains to be seen. While the coin has gained a lot of attention in recent months, it is still a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency world. It will need to continue to attract new investors and build a strong community if it hopes to compete with established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency industry is notoriously volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. While Kitty Coin has seen strong growth in recent months, there is no guarantee that this will continue.

Overall, it is clear that Kitty Coin has captured the attention of many investors and has the potential to be a major player in the meme coin industry. However, only time will tell whether it can sustain its momentum and truly come out on top.",1,0,2023-04-20 09:20:56,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Hello, your post was removed because your account is less than 60 days old or you do not have the required 500 **comment** karma to make post submissions.', 1)]"

Do you think Cryptos used for everyday Payments/Shopping will ever become normalized or had that ship now sailed?,"To give some context to what I'm referring to.  Back when crypto was starting to get more popular and hitting new highs- many people along with corporate America and global markets seemed to be getting excited about the potential for crypto's integration into everyday life.

This included a push for cryptos meant for every day purchases at places like AMC Theaters, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc..

I remember one crypto in particular in the US was focusing on this- Amptoken- I was kind of hyped on them in those times and even used a number of times to buy food at Dunkin with- also with Dogecoin I had in my account at the time. 

I sold my holdings of Amp a long time ago cause it seemed to be going nowhere

Top 50 Holders of EOS control 94% of the total supply,"A few days ago I made a post about Dogecoin and the fact 66% of the supply is controlled by the top 100 addresses. Well I continued to do some digging into other cryptocurrencies and found that 94% of all EOS is owned by the top 50 addresses.

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing these numbers I did some more research and found this issue was brought to light 5 years ago on the EOS subreddit in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o7cdw/eos_rich_listgenesis_snapshot_statistics/?rdt=45022) and this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/news/top-100-holders-eos-own-75-or-11b-worth/) when the situation wasn't nearly as bad and the supply was smaller.

Total Supply 5 Years Ago: 1,000,000,000 EOS Tokens | Total Today: 1,153,534,963 EOS Tokens (Supply increased 15.35%)

At that time of that post the top 100 holders had around 75% of the supply and 5 later the top 10 addresses alone have more than that. These are the top 10 addresses today:

1. [eosio.stake](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.stake) | 253215017 EOS | 21.95% of supply
2. [eosupbitcold](https://eosflare.io/account/eosupbitcold) | 156399705 EOS | 13.56% of supply
3. [binancecold2](https://eosflare.io/account/binancecold2) | 81967940 EOS | 7.11% of supply
4. [eosio.fund](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.fund) | 68277906 EOS | 5.92% of supply
5. [j4obibe5lfv1](https://eosflare.io/account/j4obibe5lfv1) | 64885405 EOS | 5.62% of supply
6. [b1](https://eosflare.io/account/b1) | 64672348 EOS | 5.61% of supply
7. [okbtothemoon](https://eosflare.io/account/okbtothemoon) | 61139288 EOS | 5.30% of supply
8. [eosio.rex](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.rex) | 59021990 EOS | 5.12% of supply
9. [wlqdprkffody](https://eosflare.io/account/wlqdprkffody) | 36073985 EOS | 3.13% of supply
10. [kjhbgvcfghfd](https://eosflare.io/account/kjhbgvcfghfd) | 27249789 EOS | 2.36% of supply

Though tbf the top holder with a little over a 5th of the supply seems to be a staking wallet.

To all the EOS investors, does this concern you? If you aren't invest in EOS and you saw this would you consider this a red flag? Personally have never invested in EOS but this would be a red flag in my book. The fact that such a small number of addresses control such a large % concerns me.

Anyone who staked to the original pool has their balance moved into this account, which is controlled by a smart contract.\n2. eosio.rex (#8) is a secondary staking pool users can opt into vs eosio.stake.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far. The risks in terms of centralization and potential sell offs created by that are obvious.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The Bitcoin stack: Bringing Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos Ecosystem,"***Intro***

The Cosmos ecosystem is full of innovative app-chains, built with sovereignty at their core. These projects seek to build their chains to serve a specific purpose, they wish to *do on task, and be exceptional at it*. 

One example I can name are Osmosis, an AMM that provides an extremely good UX, and uses various different capital efficient features to create light amounts of slippage and distributes tons of value back to Osmosis token stakers.

A few app-chain, that will be entering the Cosmos soon, are *Nomic* and *Babylon*. Both are providing Bitcoin related services, to bring both Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem.

***Nomic***- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn’t use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side.

Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well in the future.

***Babylon***- Bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. One of the big use cases that can come from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Many Cosmos chains have unbonding times between 14-28 days. However, Babylons service could bring down unbonding times to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it’s security preferences.

***Conclusion***

These two chains have work left to do, before they officially launch, however both plan to have mainnets in 2023. They lay the foundation to bring Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem, without centralized sequencers or 5/8 multisig attack vectors.

What's your biggest crypto-related regret that you have?,"Everyone that dabbled or heard for crypto has probably shitload of regrets. If you heard for it early, if you pondered to buy BTC or some altcoin early but didn't, if you had BTC early but sold it too early, and on the other side if you overinvested into some shitcoin/scam that didn't pan out? What was it?

 Mine personally is when I wanted to buy 1 BTC in late 2013 when it was around $800 and it was having a big upwards rally in past few days. In the end I just gave up because I was clueless about how to buy it, I remember creating account on some website (it could have been Coinbase) seeing that I have to put my ID in and wait few days to verify and I just gave up. And then soon later it crashed due to Mt. Gox and similar scams that got to mainstream media so at that moment I was glad I didn't buy it.

"New to crypto, looking for tips on wallets and good coins to invest in regularly!","Hey everyone!

I'm new to the world of crypto and I'm excited to dive in and start investing. I've been doing some research and learning as much as I can, but I wanted to reach out to the community and see if anyone has any tips for me.

First off, I'm wondering about the best wallets to use for storing my crypto. I've heard of some popular ones like Coinbase and Binance, but I'm not sure which one would be the best for me as a beginner. I'd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you might have.

Secondly, I'm curious about good coins to invest in regularly. I'm planning on investing smaller amounts over time, so I'm not looking to make huge gains overnight. I'm more interested in long-term investments that have the potential to grow over time. I've heard of coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, but I'm wondering if there are any other good ones out there that I should consider.

Overall, I'm just really excited to be starting my crypto journey and I'm eager to learn as much as I can. If anyone has any tips, advice, or words of wisdom for me, I would greatly appreciate it!

This might not sound like the most grandiose of titles, but it does carry weight. Since Doge's inception, countless other meme coins have followed in Doge's footsteps (or pawsteps), including SHIB, Banano and DogelonMars. Whenever these coins receive attention, they are inevitably compared to Doge (in a similar way to how new non-meme coins are often compared to Bitcoin/Ethereum). This creates ever more visibility and demand for Doge, as it is seen as the Bitcoin of meme coins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Doge coin has had serious adoption. To name just a few places one can spend Doge coin, you can spend the meme coin at the Dallas Mavericks, ExpressVPN, Ledger, and airBaltic. That is more adoption than most serious coins. This sort of adoption, and potential for more adoption in the future, makes Doge coin a great investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, memes. The ability to create memes about a coin, without it seeming forced, is a non-trivial marketing tool. One can easily create extra traction and visibility for Doge, allowing Doge to welcome in new investors with ease. Often, other coins try this technique, but it seems insincere and a little on the nose. The ability to meme about a coin, especially in the social media age, is a feature that separates Doge from the rest of the pack.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Mass adoption for everyday purchases vs. hodl often sounds contradictory. Where are you at with these principles?,"One thing that’s always seemed a little odd to me since getting into crypto around 2018 are the number of people that are diehard “hodl or die”. 
At the same time we constantly hear about wanting mass adoption with the idea that crypto will replace fiat. What’s wrong with both?

Given how dead serious people get about one or other when it comes to commenting, it often come across contradictory knowing that people do both. I’ve noticed, We tend to especially talk down to people here that may actually find an exchange useful. 

I get and like the idea of self custody but with gas fees for exchanging it’s not as convenient. At the same time I also get that it’s not a good idea to keep the main nest egg in an exchange that could go the way of FTX. 

Main point is that I think we need to be less harsh about telling people what they have to do when different options work for different things. 

Side note since it will come up: Yes I know someone can pay from their own wallet but, we also need  to think about people that pay or take various crypto payments that want to or prefer to convert (for fee) or deposit to their bank account.


TLDR: It’s not one or the other. It’s completely fine to 1) hold your nest egg in self custody and also 2) keep some Dogecoin or XLM (examples only) in an exchange linked to a bank account for gas free exchanges and payments to and from people.

“Community” Meme/shitcoins are cults and damaging to mental health,"Meme/shitcoin communities are cults and damaging to peoples mental health, yeah its true… especially to the mental health of youth. 

As funny as it may sound it’s actually true, we live in a economy where it might be uncertain whether or not you will even be able to buy or rent a house/apartment some day. People will look at anything that can potentially make them money and fomo in.

There are so many shitcoin projects and “memecoin” projects getting major exposure on social media as well as general media. This gets young people not understanding the risks of investment in these coins to invest mayor funds. You can call them dumb, but really is it their fault when they are so so desperate to make some money to make it in life?

As media will say 1000x in just a week! People will fomo in and be basically held hostage by the so called “community” and gas fees and those bs “tokenomics”. Saying don’t fear just Hodl. Really? Hodl what? A token with literally 0 utility? The same thing is any other “community” token? 

The “communities” of these tokens are so deep into this whole scheme that they will say anything is fud even if it is the truth. And will say just hodl! Whilst watching their money go down the drain. 

These coins are literally all designed to lure people in and keep them captive, no rugpull needed. Focus and invest in real projects and other blockchains, not shit meme tokens that wont make you any money. 

It is literally insane to me thet shiba inu is number 15 on cmc based on market cap. A litteral shitcoin with no functionality what so ever. Safemoon, dogecoin, really?

What’s your favorite crypto story?,"Hello fellow crypto degenerates.
I was just thinking about how many interesting and good moments we have had along the way and It has been a lot.

From the guy buying pizza with Bitcoin to the Dogecoin meme pump. Also considering events which (I believe) were critical and important to cryptocurrencies development: from the very recent USDC re-pegging to the very first BTC transaction. 

For me, definitely the Bitcoin pizza story is my favorite moment: the fact that the same amount of BTC could be worth a couple of pizzas 13 years ago, while today It would be literally life-changing money, is really the symbol of how much this market has grown. 

Tell me, what is your favorite moment/story?

EDIT: One of you reminded me of another nice moment which happened on this very sub. A guy from South America (cannot remember the specific country, but I think It was Venezuela) posted about getting his groceries with BTC.

^(\*\* Ven could be swapped to VET in early 2018 at a 1 to 100 ratio. Meaning price should be multiplied by 100 to get a current comparison.)

Reviewing the price changes of the top 100 since Dec. 17th. 2017

* Total Assets that are Positive = 7
* Total Assets that are 0 to -50% = 8
* Total Assets that are -50% to -75% = 10
* Total Assets that are -75% to -90% = 13
* Total Assets that are -90% to -99% = 38
* Total Assets that are -99% to -100% = 24

21 of the top 100 from Dec. 17th 2017 are still in the top 100 today.

The Seven Green Assets are:

1. BNB = +5,081%
2. ChainLink = +1,685%
3. Dogecoin = +1,043%
4. Decentraland = +400%
5. Ethereum = +162%
6. Tron = +89%
7. Bitcoin = +47%

Edit: Due to the 1 to 100, VEN to VET swap. VET is also up roughly 137% after calculating additional VET after swap.

**Thanks to a few huge gainers that cancels  out the losses of everything else - If you had invested $1 in each of the top 100 Cryptos on Dec. 17th 2017 you'd have $105.20 today, up 5.2%.**

"Rebutting the Argument, Moons will Never be in the top 100.","I'm posting this as a rebuttal to a popular post from four days ago, [""Why Moons will never be Top100""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12zz03g/why_moons_will_never_be_top100/). In that post Op made five arguments for why Moons would never be in the top 100, although some arguments have merit most others are bad faith arguments with no merit or validity.

# Quick Reminder on Moons

Op reminds everyone that Reddit has a stance Moons don't have value. Op acknowledges this is a legal argument from Reddit. Nothing else to add to this section.

# Not your everyday sh*tcoin

Ops states Moons won't pump because they aren't your everyday sh\*tcoin and doesn't have any marketing.

This argument ignores the fact it's probably one of the best known tokens of this SubReddit. Moon development is completely community driven, members of this community have 163 ETH in Liquidity and 1.435M Moons on SushiSwap liquidity. One of the best things about Dogecoin is the community that wanted to build and promote it. Moons have what many sh\*t coins wish they had, a community that wants to see it develop.

**So no it's not your average sh\*tcoin where people play the greater fool hoping to pump and not be burned. It's actually being developed in a grassroots way.**

# No one cares

Op states since there are over 6M members of this sub and only 200k Moon holders  (3%) it's proof that no one cares about Moons. Again this is another bad faith argument, a subscriber just means an account that subscribed to a community, it doesn't take into consideration account activity on Reddit. Many of those accounts could be banned bots or old accounts that haven't signed into Reddit for years.

200K Moon Holders is a ton of people. Sh\*tcoins like Pepe dream of ever reaching 10K holders.

A better statistic would be sub activity which is currently \~5,000 active members on at a time. That means the amount of holders is 40x higher than the active member count, so people who are active on the sub do care.

# Holder repartition is a Red Flag

Op claims having Moon whales means these accounts will dump their Moons and prevent any bull run. He also then creates a hypothetical disaster with liquidity providers based off a thought experiment. Again this is a bad argument, although it is true there are big whales that could dump Moons, there are big whales in every crypto asset that could dump. The largest individual Moon holder, holds just over 1% of the total circulating supply or about 2% if you don't consider Reddits Wallets. That isn't that much for a sh\*tcoin.

# Usecase &gt; Pump

Op claims Moons can't pump because people got them for free.

So lets talk another sh\*tcoin, AiDoge is pumping with a marketcap 9x larger than Moons, and it was given to people for free. Why would you buy this sh\*tcoin when you could have gotten it for free or can get it for free? Yet the price is up nearly 10X since it first started being given out.

So ignoring this flawed argument let's talk about Moons. Moons act as a Proof of Engagement/Reputation. The more moons you have the larger your virtual ~~d\*\*k~~  status symbol. People buy skins for video games simply because it'll make them stand out. Ignoring everything else positive about Moons, (Banner, Staking Rewards, most developed Reddit Community Token) people have and will buy Moons to stand out in this SubReddit.

As the supply that gets airdropped every snapshot continues to decrease it will become harder and harder to earn moons, and large Moon holders will stand out even more, further incentivizing users to buy Moons to stand out.

Do you think there could be a day in the future where crypto becomes bigger than the stock market?,"This could be a fantasy idea but I think it could be an interesting scenario if it ever became possible one day. In reality if it ever would happen we probably aren't anywhere near that at this point in time.

Imagine though- the year is 2050- crypto is more popular than ever. Bitcoin is a normal part of banks and salary payments. Dogecoin despite being a meme is now regularly accepted at Walmart. ETH has either upgraded to be more efficient or is taken over by something that has low gas fees and works easier. 

Now the fun part- some trends have flipped around and the world stock market is 10 trillion dollars while the total crypto market is 40 trillion.

Crypto is now the preferred market even across the globe since it makes it easier to move around and deal with that instead of regular currencies.

What do you think?

Hard to believe stories moments in crypto world,"
Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade now, and during that time, there have been many significant moments that are hard to believe. Here are just a few examples:

1. The First Bitcoin Purchase: On May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made the first-ever Bitcoin purchase by using 10,000 BTC to buy two Papa John's pizzas. At the time, the value of Bitcoin was only a few cents, but today those same 10,000 BTC would be worth millions of dollars.

2. The Mt. Gox Hack: In 2014, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was hacked, resulting in the theft of 850,000 BTC, worth over $450 million at the time. The incident highlighted the need for stronger security measures in the cryptocurrency industry and led to the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox.

3. The Ethereum DAO Hack: In 2016, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in a smart contract on the Ethereum network, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million Ether, worth over $50 million at the time. The incident led to a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic.

4. The Bitcoin Bull Run of 2017: In late 2017, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from around $1,000 to nearly $20,000 in just a few months, leading to a frenzy of speculation and investment in cryptocurrencies. The market eventually crashed in early 2018, but the event marked a significant moment in the history of cryptocurrencies and brought them into the mainstream consciousness.

5. The Dogecoin Craze: In early 2021, a group of retail investors on Reddit and other social media platforms began buying up Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that started as a joke, pushing its price up by more than 10,000% in just a few months. The event highlighted the growing influence of social media on the cryptocurrency market and the power of community-driven investment movements.

These are just a few examples of the many significant moments in the history of cryptocurrencies that are hard to believe. As the industry continues to evolve and grow, there will undoubtedly be many more to come.

An ecosystem of Application specific blockchains,"The Cosmos Ecosystem is a system of sovereign blockchains, connected using the IBC protocol. 

Brief IBC explainer:

An IBC connection is made, when one chains validator, runs a dedicated light client or node that serves the purpose of transmitting information from one blockchain, to a seperate light client or node. After that, each network agrees to the changes made to each network, and then the changes are made to the ledger.

Interesting blockchains connected to the IBC:

There are many IBC connected chains, that are currently in production or are soon to be. So I wanted to go ahead and list out some exciting projects and brief explanations as to what these projects do.

***Archway***- Interoperable smart contracting platform (Cosmwasm enabled, explained in the JUNO section). Tokenomics include for a portion of inflation and fees to be distributed to the smart contract itself, allowing for Devs to use these new tokenomics in innovative ways to incentivize both themselves or incentivize their DApp users.

***Osmosis***- Interchain AMM app chain. Basically, any chain that releases a token, ends up connecting to Osmosis so their token can be traded on the platform. Osmosis is also a permissioned layer 1, so smart contracts are starting to launch, with Mars Protocol being the first. 

***Neutron***- Neutron is a Cosmwasm enabled Smart contracting platform, that will be leveraging the Cosmos Hubs economic security, through Interchain Security. Neutron will also be home to Lido liquid staking services for the Cosmos Ecosystem, as well as the Astroport Dex.

The Neutron proposal to join Interchain Security actually passed on May 5th. It sill have a launch period from May 8th to May 21st, for validators to spin up the node to run Neutron. So essentially May 21st should be the day that Neutron is launched and functioning as a sovereign blockchain utilizing the Cosmos Hub validator set for economic security and in turn, Cosmos Hub delegators will earn NTRN tokens.

***Nomic***- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn’t use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side. Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well.

***Babylon***- bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. Tone of the main use cases that comes from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Estimated to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it’s preferences.

***Juno***- the first Cosmwasm smart contracting platform in the Cosmos. Cosmwasm is a web assembly module, built to easily port into the Cosmos SDK, making it possible to add smart contract functionality to a chain, with minimal to no need for additional code. Juno has DAO DAO as an extremely innovative feature of the platform, which allows for anyone to easily and quickly create a DAO, and find it with any IBC assets. DAO DAO will soon have a lot more interoperability features and ways for it to expand its reach out into the Cosmos, while residing on JUNO as its main chain. 

***Agoric/IST***- JavaScript smart contracting platform. Created by Dean Tribble and Mark Miller, who’s records i encourage anyone to look into. They have been writing papers on computer science and large scale distribution of code since the 80’s. I digress, this platform runs on a form of JavaScript called Hardened JavaScript. Which makes JavaScript more secure than regular JavaScript, but still familiar for those who use Javascript as their main programming language. Agoric is also home to IST, an over collateralized stable token that will be backed by many native Cosmos 
assets.

***Sommelier***- currently trading pairs on ETH, but soon to be a multi chain automated asset trading platform. This project uses trading strategies that are automatically executed via smart contracts and gains are distributed to stakers of its native token SOMM. Currently only has a few trading vaults on Uniswap, however the staking yield for SOMM, from trading is currently 12% with no token inflation at all. 

***Akash***- decentralized cloud storage. This projes seeks to provide cloud storage as much cheaper costs than it would be from a centralized provider, while also making that cloud storage decentralized and largely censorship resistant. Project has an active product for decentralized cloud storage, but it is still building out more features for it to scale to much higher capacity. 

This isn’t an extensive list at all, but I feel like this covers alot of ground in terms of some of the most interesting and exciting projects being built in Cosmos, all of which can be found on Reddit or Twitter!

Pepe the Frog meme creator and copyright owner Matt Furie weighs in on the memecoin mania and says he's a Dogecoin maxi,"A bunch of self-proclaimed crypto influencers got Matt Furie on their Twitter space discussion to talk about Pepe and here's what he said:

&gt; Actually, this is the first time I've heard of it. What is Pepe coin? I've heard of Ethereum, I've heard of Bitcoin, and I've heard of Dogecoin; is it like that? Dogecoin's the best. I'm a Dogecoin maxi.

https://twitter.com/enjoyoor/status/1655708365748686848

Since he has the copyright for the original Pepe the Frog meme, he has also been quite vocal against its use for cash grab NFT ponzis in the past. Sad Frogs Districts project which was among the earliest pepe-based NFT projects [was removed by OpenSea](https://decrypt.co/78788/pepe-the-frog-meme-nfts-opensea-copyright-dmca) after Furie filed a complaint against it around August of 2021. Given how many more NFT projects and coins have come up around the meme over the last month, it's going to be interesting to see if he takes any further action to protect investors.

Anyone holding anything pepe related should beware since he's pretty serious about preventing wrongful use of the meme and had also [invoked the copyright law](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/21/16333162/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-dmca-takedown-fair-use-matt-furie) to prevent alt-right meme makers from using his work for spreading hateful content in 2017.

Boredom gets the best of us,"Hey, hey, hey! It’s me! 

So, I got a great piece of advice. Don’t get bored and stare at crypto shit all night!

So I recently had a kid (1st kid), boy. He’s great! A blessing from God! Truly my pride and joy this past 12 days that he’s been on this earth.

That being said, I get up in the midnight shift of him waking, fed, change etc. the last two nights he decided to be up for like 3-4 hours. So what do I do? Scroll Reddit, cexs and some articles here and there. 

We’ll here’s the problem, boredom left me “investing” in this damn Pepe. Got some 130 million for like $240. I don’t need the $240 so if it’s gone it’s gone. Here’s my logic. I just remember buying 1.2 million dogecoin for $100 and sold it for $200 back in whatever year. What’s a $240 risk? Overall, who the fuck cares or knows?! Rug pull or not, I pulled the plug and got some.

Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))\n&gt; \n&gt; # PROs\n&gt; \n&gt; **It's Decentralized**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. No need for a central authority\n&gt; 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)\n&gt; 3. Ledger is distributed and public\n&gt; 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner\n&gt; 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address\n&gt; 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source\n&gt; \n&gt; **Provides Privacy**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Security**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network.

Mining fees and settlement times have varied so much over the last few years that it is simply not a reliable platform for transactions.  Without predictable fees, a business can\'t build a budget; without predictable settlement times, businesses can\'t sell products efficiently.  \n&gt; \n&gt; A proposed solution for the speed and cost issue is the Lightning network, but unfortunately this again is inconsistent.  Lighting is not a network-wide upgrade, so transactions don\'t all use the ""new"" system.  A business can\'t commit to using Bitcoin if the transaction will probably settle quickly; they need to *know*.\n&gt; \n&gt; The market price of Bitcoin is an additional inconsistency.  If the price changed slowly over months or years businesses could adopt it, but when it sometimes changes hour-by-hour it\'s too unpredictable to use when selling products or services.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some propose that Bitcoin could be simply a store of value - an asset rather than a transactional currency.  Unfortunately that makes it just a collectible: it has value only as long as other people also want it.  Unless Bitcoin finds a way to have commercial value, it will hold value as ineffectively as Beanie Babies and stamp collections.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final nail in the coffin may be the unfortunate and perhaps unfair perception issues in our media.  Bitcoin is featured in stories about exchange fraud, environmental concerns, and rebel groups like ""Freedumb"" convoys.  Whether you think those issues have merit or not, most businesses prefer to avoid things that are volatile and controversial.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Bitcoin to grow and be valuable it has to be commercially useful.  In most stable economies fiat currency can be sent between people or spent by consumers at any time, instantly, and without transaction fees.  BTC can not make those same promises, and brings with it unpredictability and uncertainty.  Unless Bitcoin makes dramatic changes it is doomed to fail in the end.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin.

Opinion: DRC-20 tokens are better than BRC-20 tokens,"As some of you might now, in the last few days/weeks there has been some hype about tokens being on other blockchains. Those blockchains being namely Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

Now just to clarify, I do not think that these are useful in any way. I believe that we already have a number of functional blockchains for tokens (ETH, POLYGON, BSC, and more) that are more than enough for what we need. I honestly don’t think that we need to clutter up any other blockchains with tokens.

However, when comparing the BRC-20 and DRC-20 tokens, Bitcoin and Dogecoin tokens respectively, I believe that tokens launched on Dogecoin have a higher chance for success.

And the reason for this ti ply comes down to transaction fees. When BRC-20 tokens were hyped (again, BTC blockchain), the transaction fees skyrocketed, making transfers extremely expensive 

However, a few days ago with the DRC-20 token hype (Dogecoin tokens), there was no noticeable change in transaction cost. Despite having significantly more transaction (many x more than usual), there was no noticeable change in transaction fees.


TLDR: I think Dogecoin based token have a higher chance of success than Bitcoin based tokens purely due to the fact that the Dogecoin network is able to handle a significant increase in transaction volume without skyrocketing gas fees",10,37,2023-05-17 12:29:21,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('DRC-20 tokens of course, but just to keep the dogs at bay.', 2), ('Degens avoiding this analysis testifies to the fact that most of us came for the money, not the tech.', 4), ('Why does BTC need a blockchain', 4), ('Dont know about you chief but i would rather have meme tokens on a memecoin rather than meme tokens on the literal top bluechip crypto', 2), ('Both are ill-suited for their intent, so who cares which is better when they both suck.', 5), ('Shitcoins belong in a meme chain anyways', 4), ('I agree, we should just stick to chains meant to handle tokens', 1), ('Shitcoin ²', 3), ('Why does my car need tires?', 3), ('Doge 1 - Bitcoin 0', 1), ('Dogecoin was already a memechain so I think that memecoins are more at home there, DRC-20 tokens align with the Dogecoin community more than BRC-20 align with the Bitcoin community', 1), (""Let's call them what they are:\n\nDRC-20 = Shitcoins\n\nBRC-20 = Shitcoins\n\nI personally don't think it matters which pile of poop is bigger than the other."", 5), (""I get your point but don't forget the security aspect.

Can Dogecoin replace Ethereum?,"Can Dogecoin replace Ethereum? Here is my stupid theory that is 100% wrong in a world that is not a simulation.

The dogecoin transactions recently surpassed 1 million transactions for a 24-hour period with DRC-20 tokens being created. If you look at [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/) you will see that Dogecoin transactions have surpassed its own all time high as well as Bitcoin transaction all time high and is now on par with Ethereum's daily transactions.

What is special about this is that there has not been any noticeable congestion on the Dogecoin network, and it is handling the extra volume well. The transaction speeds have not been dramatically affected and the average fee is still well below a penny. Compare that with the transaction fee for Ethereum and Bitcoin on this chart and you will see that Dogecoin is still superior for fees even with the insane # of transactions.

What kind of coins did you mainly buy?,"According to my observations, there are a few types of coins depending on their market movement and utility. 

1. Bitcoin - first cryptocurrency, king of our hearts, leading the market since its creation.

2. Coins that show potential and deliver - projects like Ethereum that are promising novelties, solutions to problems, etc. and actually deliver good services and have great developers. This shows in their market trends as they usually make their way upwards over a longer period.

3. Coins that show potential but fail to deliver - Not all coins are scams. I do believe that some projects really mean to develop as solutions to some problems and are planning to upgrade the existing tech. Unfortunately as the time goes, their roadmap gets posponed and postponed. They might deliver but in a very stretched timeframe. Eventually people lose interest in them and only the religious bag holders still hope for the project's development.

4. Meme coins ""pump and dump"" - we all know these, they usually dont last long on the market, developers hype people into buying and then sell their bags, usually leaving other holders unable to even sell for loss.

5. Meme coins that pump and dump and then somehow stay there - Im talking about Dogecoin for example. First meant as a total meme, but now has its own blockchain and even some utility. For some it is not considered a meme coin anymore. Pepe might be going in this direction?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"What was the first crypto currency you bought or mined, and why?","Long time crypto-head here, mining and buying since 2013, but still unfortunately not rich nor anywhere near a millionaire from what you might expect from a crypto og.

I remember first hearing about Bitcoin back in it's early years, from a colleague of mine who brought my attention to this new ""internet currency"".  

Beans was pretty popular years and years ago if anyone remembers that (you're showing your age though if you do), so talk of a new internet currency made me instantly think of that.

I was shown a Windows app where you could mine Bitcoin, but after playing with it for half an hour, I soon forgot about it. After all, you'd have to leave your PC mining for weeks if not months in order to get just 1000 or even 10,000 bitcoins. Crazy!

Fast forward a couple of years, and my same friend said ""Hey, remember that Bitcoin, well they're now worth $100 each!

My interest was peaked, but I regrettably I thought I'd missed the boat. Surely Bitcoin couldn't go up even more?

So at this point I decided to buy a few Litecoin instead, as it was the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold"". Over the next year or so I became pretty engrossed in the whole crypto scene, and bought, mined and traded a bunch of different coins on exchanges such as BTC-e and Cryptsy.

Then I started buying graphics cards to mine a combination of Litecoin and then later Dogecoin.

I always thought Litecoin was destined to stay 2nd to Bitcoin, and up until the last few years, it wasn't far off.

So I've got Litecoin to thank for getting me into all this and causing me to become a first rate degen.

What if crypto already peaked?,"Imagine the year is 2030 and bitcoin is still hovering around 26-35k more or less depending on the month.

Still in the top 10 are bitcoin etherium and Dogecoin.  The market rarely gets further than the days of the covid pandemic crypto spike/marketcap. 

Meaning people aren't getting 'rich' off crypto like un the early days, just mostly whales who can afford big risks in little pumps.

That said at least there is some stability if the market is sticking around but maybe doesn't have the old hype that it used to.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

As a result, there will always be a limitless supply of Doge that anyone can mine or buy. Simply put, DOGEs will be available indefinitely. It's not a suitable option to store value because of its inflationary nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; **No innovation**\n&gt; \n&gt; The Luckycoin cryptocurrency, which was a derivative of Litecoin and is now dead, served as the inspiration for the original Dogecoin programming. Dogecoin's pricing is based on how much the community believes the cryptocurrency should sell for. They also choose the price and timing for exchanging the cryptocurrency for others that have solid fundamentals supporting their value, which demonstrates that individuals view doge more as a way to become rich quick than as an investment opportunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price manipulation via pump and dumps**\n&gt; \n&gt; A pro for dogecoin was its community and meme culture that was created by Elon Musk and WSB, that makes doge pump and dump based on Elon's tweets.

Wake up - it's 2014...,"It's 2014.

Your friends and family are doing the ice bucket challenge ; you are enjoying your new iPhone 6 - and your hear about a coin based on a dog meme called dogecoin.

You join the subreddit and say hello and you are tipped 500 dogecoin by some generous shibe and they show you how to create your own wallet to hold the dogecoin.

Suddenly you are in the world of cryptocurrency - but here's the thing... The price isn't much to brag about but the community was blossoming and thriving.

So much was done in that time - from the 98 dogecar, to the Jamaican bobsled team and people from all over the world coming together as a community and spreading the word of dogecoin.

Flash forward - people have made their money - the whales have squeezed it dry and the original dev has abandoned it.

The community seems to have migrated to blue bird and has certainly lost the spirit it once had.

The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))\n&gt; \n&gt; # PROs\n&gt; \n&gt; **It's Decentralized**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. No need for a central authority\n&gt; 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)\n&gt; 3. Ledger is distributed and public\n&gt; 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner\n&gt; 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address\n&gt; 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source\n&gt; \n&gt; **Provides Privacy**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Security**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network.

One thing is that they won't have to worry much about it's price dropping now since they're still much likely in the green in terms of percentage gains. Most of these early investors are also capable of manipulating the market via wash trades not giving the true traded volume within the market and thus deceiving most novice traders/investors into believing fake signals ([2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe), [3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08)). There is even a possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves will suddenly access the wallet he/she/they own/s and proceed to sell the large amount of BTC they have which would greatly cause a crash in Bitcoin's price.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Attracts Illegal Transactions and Criminal Activities**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin's innate trait of being publicly available and pseudonymous not only attracts those who seek independence but it also attracts those engage in illicit activities and perform illegal transactions. This is one of the downsides of giving back the power of choice to people, not all of them will do the morally right thing to do and as a result, economist, lawyers, and even countries will label Bitcoin as just another medium for buying/selling illegal goods/services.

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; **The Requirement of Being Responsible and Disciplined**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The constant triple-checking of addresses making sure that it's yours and not some dead end address or the fact that you need to keep your passphrase safe physically and never keep them in any device connected to the internet as to avoid any possible hacks/scams. The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n&gt; [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140325214514/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-08/did-the-sec-just-validate-bitcoin-no-](https://web.archive.org/web/20140325214514/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-08/did-the-sec-just-validate-bitcoin-no-) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2012/09/29/monetarists-anonymous](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2012/09/29/monetarists-anonymous) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-criticizes-bitcoin.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-criticizes-bitcoin.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/stiglitz-roubini-and-rogoff-lead-joint-attack-on-bitcoin-20180709](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/stiglitz-roubini-and-rogoff-lead-joint-attack-on-bitcoin-20180709) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

In April 2019, it moved to its own blockchain called Binance Chain. Today, it operates on two blockchains, the other one being Binance Smart Chain. The coin is issued, developed and maintained by the biggest cryptocurrency exchange – Binance.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Pros\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT IS BACKED BY BINANCE**\n&gt; \n&gt; Binance Coin is maintained by Binance, a cryptocurrency giant. Binance is currently the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Its transaction volume is [roughly 6 times higher](https://www.statista.com/statistics/864738/leading-cryptocurrency-exchanges-traders/) on average than that of Coinbase. Binance makes sure that BNB finds more and more utility within their ecosystem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Backing of such a massive company should give investors a lot of confidence even though Binance is lately under an intensified regulatory scrutiny. But the company declares that it is doing its best to comply with all the regulations. They're working on a stricter KYC and they’re also expanding the legal and compliance teams by hiring many experts in the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; The co-operation between Binance and regulators was demonstrated when the exchange [limited its services for people from Russia](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/4887e569afdf4b1e89e024371d3a49b9).\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT GIVES YOU DISCOUNTS ON BINANCE**\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the reasons why Binance is so popular is the fact that their [transaction fees are among the lowest](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311). Users pay just 0.1% for most popular types of trades, whereas on e.g. Coinbase (Pro) it’s 5 times more – [0.5%](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees). One of the benefits of BNB is making those fees even lower – by as much as 25%. **Using BNB to pay for transaction fees can save you up to 1/4 of your money** on transactions. It’s a big incentive to hold some BNB.\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT IS DEFLATIONARY**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2021, Binance implemented two important changes to BNB burning mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, [Bruno Upgrade v1.1.5](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-smart-chain-bruno-upgrade-v1-1-5/) took place on 30 November. It introduced real-time burning mechanism. It is similar to [ETH London Upgrade](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/fixing-the-ethereum-fee-market-eip-1559-9109f1c1814b) \\- some of the gas fee collected by validators is burned. As of 15 June 2022, [more than 90 000 BNB were burned](https://twitter.com/BurnBNB).\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, on 23 December 2021, Binance announced and implemented **BNB** **Auto-Burn** protocol. It replaces quarterly burns which were based on the profits Binance made (they committed 20% of their profit to buy back BNB and then burn it. There were [17 quarterly burns](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/17th-bnb-burn-%7C-quarterly-highlights-and-insights-from-cz-421499824684902908)). Now, the process is automated, which makes it more transparent and predictable. The core idea has not been changed, however, the process will stop when the number of BNB coins in circulation is lower than 100 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MANY TRADING PAIRS, STAKING, FARMING AND OTHER USES**\n&gt; \n&gt; As an official coin of Binance, BNB also offers a **multitude of trading pairs**. All transactions made with BNB are lightning **fast and secure** since it’s based on one of the most secure blockchains – Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are also many options of **staking** BNB on Binance for a very good APY or participating in **Launchpools** (farming new tokens) and **Launchpads** (Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) - buying new tokens).\n&gt; \n&gt; BNB is **accepted by some service providers**, e.g. HTC, trip.io, travala.com, BitTorrent or PureVPN.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last but not least, BNB can be used to convert “leftovers”. Very often when you sell a coin, a very small amount of it is left in your wallet. On Binance, you can **convert small amounts of coins** (called “dust”) into BNB.\n&gt; \n&gt; **TWO BLOCKCHAINS THAT WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY**\n&gt; \n&gt; BNB operates on two chains, the above mentioned **Binance Chain** and **Binance Smart Chain** (BSC) which was launched in September 2020. While Binance Chain is responsible for transactions made on Binance DEX, BSC was designed specifically for smart contracts, DeFi and dApps. It quickly became **one of the biggest blockchains**. It is compatible with Ethereum allowing other projects to transfer easily from ETH to BSC and escape high gas fees on ETH.\n&gt; \n&gt; This dual blockchain approach combined with the **Proof of Staked Authority** consensus algorithm (a mix of share proof and authority proof) makes it much more scalable than Ethereum and enables faster and cheaper transactions. While Ethereum runs around 9 000 nodes/validators (before the software bug back in the end of August 2021), BSC needs only 21 validators.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also worth pointing out that Binance allocated $100 million for projects that launch on BSC.\n&gt; \n&gt; **DECENTRALIZATION AT ALL COST?**\n&gt; \n&gt; The main argument against BNB is that it is centralized. And it’s impossible to deny the fact that BNB indeed is centralized compared to Ethereum and many other projects. But every stick has two ends. This is what Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO, has to say about (de)centralization:\n&gt; \n&gt; [Many people think of decentralization as absolute; you are either decentralized or not. I think that in reality, there is a gradient scale from centralization to decentralized. Often, a better question is: how decentralized should we (exchanges, societies) be, now and in the future? If decentralization simply increases freedom but decreases security and ease-of-use, there is a point where it becomes a net negative, and may not be worth it.](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/cz-on-centralization-vs-decentralization-301982828007075840)\n&gt; \n&gt; If decentralization is also about freedom of choice, then maybe being able to choose a centralized blockchain(s) should be accepted.\n&gt; \n&gt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n&gt; \n&gt; **^(Additional sources:)**\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#COIN-BURN)](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#COIN-BURN)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#BNB-RIGHT)](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#BNB-RIGHT)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/2af5831727164545b8a2c665fae8bc04)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/2af5831727164545b8a2c665fae8bc04)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-coin-bnb-why-interesting-110049570.html)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-coin-bnb-why-interesting-110049570.html)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://trading-education.com/pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-binance-coin)](https://trading-education.com/pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-binance-coin)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://guarda.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-binance-smart-chain/?utm\\\\source=Reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=Social&amp;utm\\_campaign=CryptoCurrency-BSC-article)](https://guarda.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-binance-smart-chain/?utm\\source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CryptoCurrency-BSC-article)\n&gt; \n&gt; [^(https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20815/binance-and-regulatory-scrutiny-changing-times-for-the-crypto-market)](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20815/binance-and-regulatory-scrutiny-changing-times-for-the-crypto-market)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was created in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum, and is built on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called [Ouroboros.](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cardano is designed to address some of the limitations of earlier projects, such as its main competitor Ethereum, by using more [modular](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-architecture) and flexible architecture. It also become a secure and scalable platform for the development of dApps by using a formal, research-driven approach to software development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, these features bring about several pro-points of Cardano:\n&gt; \n&gt; # Smart Contracts\n&gt; \n&gt; * Cardano\'s smart contracts are implemented using Plutus, a functional programming language specifically designed for development on the Cardano platform.\n&gt;    * Plutus is a turing-complete language written in Haskell ([source](https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/learn-about-plutus)) and allows developers to create complex and sophisticated contracts.\n&gt;    * Plutus is also designed to be highly modular, meaning that developers can easily create and import [libraries](https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/plutus-resources) of pre-written code to use in their contracts, allowing them to reuse code that has been tested and proven to be reliable.\n&gt;    * This streamlines the developing process for Cardano smart contracts, improving efficiency overall despite Haskell\'s complexity.\n&gt; * Cardano uses a unique [multi-layer architecture](https://www.cardanesia.com/post/what-is-cardano-settlement-layer-computation-layers) that separates the settlement layer, where transactions are recorded and validated, from the computation layer, where smart contracts are executed. This separation of purposes allows the computation layer to be optimized specifically for the execution of smart contracts, which in turn attempts to improve the overall performance and scalability of the platform.\n&gt; * Smart contracts on Cardano are [deterministic](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/), allowing Cardano\'s reliability to improve from the perspective of users.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Security\n&gt; \n&gt; * Currently, the minimum attack vector for Cardano is 24 as compared with Ethereum\'s 3, suggesting that the former is up to 8 times more decentralized and secure than the latter ([source](https://u.today/cardano-network-8-times-more-decentralized-than-ethereum-here-are-details)).\n&gt; * The Lace Wallet being developed by IOG, the company behind Cardano\n&gt;    * It will feature a [DID](https://cexplorer.io/article/cardano-will-have-a-new-lace-wallet) (decentralized identity) functionality for users to better allow them to control their private data and how it is used.\n&gt;    * Once it supports paper wallet PGP encryption, Charles Hoskinson [states](https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/cardano-invests-millions-of-dollars-to-improve-security-of-users-will-it-drive-ada-price-to-3/), it is impossible to hack a Lace wallet.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Speed &amp; Scalability\n&gt; \n&gt; * Cardano processes around 250 transactions per second currently, but following the Hydra upgrade each head has been tested to handle up to 1000 ([source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-fall-in-love-with-cardano)).\n&gt; * Each transaction [takes](https://bitni.com/page/cardano-ada-faq) around 5-10 minutes for finality, and costs 0.17 ADA, which is currently [worth](https://medium.com/coinmonks/fees-on-the-cardano-network-5e14af4bace7) 5 cents.\n&gt; * IOHK has outlined that they plan to improve scalability further through: block size increasing, pipelining, input endorsers, script enhancements, on-disk storage, sidechains, Hydra, off-chain computing, and Mithril ([source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/)).\n&gt; \n&gt; # Africa\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;In Cardano\'s vision for Africa, code is king and ""the code transcends government, and if the government tries to move it in a particular direction, they cannot"", added Hoskinson.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: [https://news.yahoo.com/cardano-blockchain-africa-web3-053042164.html](https://news.yahoo.com/cardano-blockchain-africa-web3-053042164.html)\n&gt; \n&gt; * Cardano\'s development team is attempting to bring financial equity to the continent of Africa by:\n&gt;    * Enabling users to prove their identity, qualifications, and securely store savings.\n&gt;    * Providing an alternative for users in oppressive countries.\n&gt;    * Issuing micro-loans to people without credit histories.\n&gt;    * Building an individual\'s transaction history by tracking their transactions.\n&gt;    * Securing property deeds on the blockchain.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin.

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far. The risks in terms of centralization and potential sell offs created by that are obvious.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics).

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

As far as liquidity and activity goes, big mining pools like ethermine offer the possibility to have mining rewards on polygon instead of mainnet. This allows small time miners to get their reward every day, on a network that will not require a week worth of mining in transfer fees, It also creates a lot of liquidity and activity; people who mine are going to receive their wrapped ethereum or other crypto, and then invest it or convert it to another tokee on polygon, They can also cash out easily, which can be a concern with L2s : I use binance, but I guess other DEX offer the possibility too. Binance allow transfering matic to the polygon network for 0.1matic, and can receive matic for pretty much nothing.  To cash out, convert the mining reward or any token in matic, transfer it to a dex, then convert it to whatever token can be loaded on their debit card, or sell it for fiat and get that money out. Finally, resilience and fee stability. There are spikes in network usage, but fees never skyrocketed. They sure are higher than at the start, but this was done to counter the work of some people that wanted this L2 to fail by trying to saturate the chain with transactions that would not cost them a cent. It still is pretty low. My worst cost was around 0,03 matic, so about 5cents, for a smart contract interaction during a spike. Compare that to the 200$ ethereum fee for a simple transaction during a spike too...\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It does so, however, at some costs which I believe will not make it a good long term play.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first issue with MATIC is ease of use. There is one CEX (gate.io) that allows MATIC withdrawals onto the Polygon network. I actually think binance.com might allow this too, but as an American I can only use binance.us which does NOT allow Polygon withdrawals. Gate.io is not a user friendly exchange which means that anyone using it is likely experienced in crypto.\n&gt; \n&gt; New users or first time Metamask users will need to learn to navigate the Plasma bridge which can be both daunting and expensive if you make mistakes. For this reason adoption will stagnate.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second issue with MATIC is centralization. According to this article ([https://gettotext.com/polygon-centralized-the-largest-wallets-hold-the-majority-of-the-matic-supply/](https://gettotext.com/polygon-centralized-the-largest-wallets-hold-the-majority-of-the-matic-supply/)) the top 10 addresses hold over 75% of the total supply. That is truly shocking. Is it worth giving up the decentralized aspect of crypto for some gas savings on a poorly designed layer 1 network with bad scalability (Ethereum)? I argue that it is not.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final argument against MATIC is more of an argument against its parent chain, Ethereum. Ethereum is currently the most integrated solution in terms of quantity of dapps and DAOs but that is not guaranteed to last forever. In fact, many other networks currently available put most of Ethereum's features to shame. This is simply because Ethereum is a second gen blockchain and newer chains have had ample time and opportunity to address Ethereum's shortcomings. However, Polygon is a scaling solution for Ethereum only and if Ethereum loses market share (which it will regardless of its status as the most adopted smart contract-enabled layer one blockchain) Polygon's usefulness and value will decline. There are too many good alternatives for an expensive and slow chain like Ethereum to maintain its dominance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Disclosure: I hold quite a bit of MATIC. Not enough to put me in the top 10, but close (ok not close but I hold a non-zero amount.) I also hold a decent amount of Ethereum which probably makes zero sense to someone reading this argument. I am short term bullish on the usefulness of both networks but I believe they will be replaced long term by more efficient and less expensive networks.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

They could still increase the fee schedule by ~40x before exceeding penny in cost. That's mainly because the fees are subsidized by staking rewards paid to powerful validators, which then contribute to ongoing SOL token [inflation of ~7%](https://messari.io/screener/supply-and-marketcap-EB1755C2) as of 2022.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Moderately-high TPS\n&gt; \n&gt; The true TPS limit of Solana over the past year after subtracting invalid transactions and vote transactions is [about 400-600](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/cc7a0d94-7f70-46f4-aae4-2f8810430931#theme=night). It's not anywhere close to their marketed throughput of 50K TPS, but it's still moderately-high for a smart contract network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Centralization is not as bad as the reputation\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana has a very bad reputation for being centralized as **SQL**ana. It's actually not that centralized. There are currently 1900 validators, and the Nakamoto Consensus for shutting down the Solana network (needs 33% staked) is [currently 33 validators](https://solanabeach.io/validators).\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, there's almost no information about the identity of these validators, so it's still possible they're mostly centrally-owned by the foundation. We just don't know.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Outage and stability issues likely to be resolved by 2 upcoming updates\n&gt; \n&gt; The days of making fun of Solana for their outages could be coming to an end. Solana is working on [2 major updates](https://decrypt.co/103106/solana-new-gas-fees) that are meant to mitigate outages and provide stability to the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **QUIC** replaces UDP for Solana's IP and Transport layer protocols. [QUIC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) provides flow control, allowing nodes to throttle incoming traffic when there's too much from both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Localized Fee Prioritization** allows Solana to dynamically charge higher fees for specific high-demand transactions. When a dApp or NFT project is congesting the network, the fee will rise for that app without affecting the rest of the network. This is a really cool solution I'd love to see other networks copy.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Lots of DeFi projects\n&gt; \n&gt; There are a ton of DeFi projects on Solana. It has 39 DeFi projects above $1M in TVL. [DeFiLlama shows Solana at $1.4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), which puts it between Tron and Arbitrum at #6.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more? Check out the [Cointest archive](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_archive#wiki_Solana) to find submissions for other topics."", 1), (""#Solana Con-Arguments\nBelow is a Solana con-argument written by Maleficent_Plankton.\n\n&gt; #CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the Cons section of [my analysis on Solana](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/vk42tn/solana_research_june_2022/)\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many flaws with Solana's network and design. Retail investors should be cautious of investing in Solana until the upcoming **QUIC** and **Localized Fee Prioritizations** fix the ongoing outage and stability issues with the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Way too many outages\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the biggest problems with Solana is that it has had way too many outages ever since its Mainnet launch. It's had at least [4 major outages, 3 partial outages](https://status.solana.com/uptime), and numerous congestions caused by DDoS attacks (some unintentional) in the 9 months between Sept 2021 and Jun 2022. That's way more than most of its competitors. These numerous outages have ruined its reputation in the crypto community.\n&gt; \n&gt; The network is very vulnerable to DoS attacks, which have brought down the network many times. In Sept 2021, a [DoS attack flooded the entire network](https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview) to the point it could not recover for almost a full day. In Jan 21-22, 2022, [bots brought down the network](https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/) with excessive duplicate transactions. A similar DDoS attack happened on Apr 30, when a [NFT minting bots took down the network](https://solana.com/news/04-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report-mitigation) with 4M TPS of spam.\n&gt; \n&gt; During DDoS attacks, validators continue forwarding transactions to the leader. Since there is no mempool, the leader has to keep up with the traffic. If the leader can't keep up, the transaction drops and the user has to resubmit it. When congested and attacked by  DDOS, the number of forks increases greatly, and leaders end up picking branches quickly and inaccurately, often extending empty blocks. This ends up reducing throughput of valid transactions and creating wasted forks. For example, during the Jan 21-22 attacks, the true throughput fell to 140 TPS. It's really easy for DDoS attacks to create a disruptive positive feedback loop that shuts down the whole network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Blockchain Design\n&gt; \n&gt; **Slower Finality**\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to the design of Proof of History consensus, Solana has probabilistic finality with a moderate chance of wasted forks. It takes [32 blocks before any transaction is final](https://docs.solana.com/proposals/block-confirmation). At 2.5s per block, this means 80 seconds. Users will see their transactions posted in 2.5s. If there's no congestions, they can probably wait 10s and assume it's probabilistically final. But if there's congestion, lots of skipped blocks, and people DDoS'ing the network, it's not deterministically final until they wait 80 seconds. This is much slower than many of their competitors, which have 2-10s deterministic finality.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Exaggerated/Useless TPS metrics**\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana's reported 50K TPS in ideal conditions is completely exaggerated.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, that number is based on a 400 ms slot time, but the current slot time is around 600-800 ms, which reduces the ideal TPS 25-50%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana also exaggerates their throughput by including non-useful transactions in their metrics. This includes vote transactions, which account for 70-90% of transactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; The count of valid TPS (excluding vote transactions and erroneous transactions) is much lower. About 80-85% of transactions are either vote transactions that are used for consensus or erroneous transactions. The true [non-vote TPS limit is much lower at around **400-600 TPS**](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/cc7a0d94-7f70-46f4-aae4-2f8810430931#theme=night) when the network isn't congested. As of June 2022, on average only 15% of total counted transactions are working transactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, validators routinely skip blocks, encounter bad forks, or post empty blocks. Even when there's no congestion, validator's unweighed skip rate is [10-25% of blocks](https://solanabeach.io/validators).\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Opaque Ledger and Block Explorer\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana has several explorers, and all of them are very opaque. The official explorer doesn't allow you to browse blocks and transactions, and it's practical useless. Solana Beach is probalby the best explorer, but it too shows almost no data except for the address and transaction fee. It is very confusing trying to decipher these transactions. There's almost no information on the identity of validators. Both of the main explorers are very slow and often stall when querying details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another part of Solana's obscurity is the 30% of the total supply of SOL that is non-circulating but staked. It's supposedly owned by the Solana Foundation. This has been discussed several times by developers on Discord, but no one seems to understand why it's there and how they're using it. It also doesn't help that Solana's main explorer and Solana Beach explorer won't load details about its non-circulating supply.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unable to Audit Smart Contracts**\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the worst issue on Solana (even worse than the outages) is that you can't audit smart contracts. When you use a smart contract on Solana, you are blindly trusting that it does what it says it'll do. There's not a single Solana Explorer that currently shows smart contract code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Developers can publish their source code on another website, but they can also redeploy their on-chain contract at the same address. So users don't have a reliable method of trusting source code published off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Poor Tokenomics\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction fees are 99% subsidized by Staking Rewards, which feed back into SOL as supply inflation**\n&gt; \n&gt; Like many networks, the low transaction fees are not enough to pay for the cost of running the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is expected to make [$12M in transaction fees in this year going by the current 30-day average]( https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana). Staking rewards is expected to [pay out around $1.4B in SOL in 2022](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile/supply-schedule). That means 99.1% of validator rewards are being paid by staking rewards instead of the artificially-low transaction fees. And staking rewards inflate the supply of the SOL token.\n&gt; \n&gt; Total supply inflation for staking started out [at 8% and gradually declines by 15% annually until it reaches 1.5%](https://docs.solana.com/inflation/inflation_schedule). Note that this is an underestimate because these calculations are based on total supply, not circulating supply, which is 30% smaller. Messari currently lists [circulating supply inflation as 7.4%](https://messari.io/screener/supply-and-marketcap-EB1755C2).\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is fully-vested as of Jan 2022, though there is a 30% gap between the recorded circulating and total supply because most of the [Foundation's staked SOL](https://explorer.solana.com/supply?filter=nonCirculating) is not included in circulating supply. (Their Explorer website barely has any supply details or charts, and doesn't even loading half of the time, so it's hard to investigate.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Other Points\n&gt; \n&gt; **Requires insecure bridges to other networks**\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is a bit isolated from other blockchains. It requires insecure bridges to connect to other networks, which is also an issue for many other networks. Bridges often get exploited, like the [Feb 2022 $320M Solana Wormhole hack](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/320-million-stolen-from-wormhole-bridge-linking-solana-and-ethereum.html). Solana needs a safer cross-chain protocol if it wants to communicate safely with other networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **High validator requirements**\n&gt; \n&gt; The minimum requirements for validators are 12-cores and 128GB of memory. 300 Mbit internet server is preferred. These are enterprise-server requirements, and they're expensive to maintain.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The Bitcoin stack in Cosmos: How the Nomic BTC bridge and Babylon Bitcoin timestamping work,"***Intro***
The Cosmos ecosystem is full of innovative app-chains, built with sovereignty at their core. These projects seek to build their chains to serve a specific purpose, they wish to *do on task, and be exceptional at it*. 

One example I can name are Osmosis, an AMM that provides an extremely good UX, and uses various different capital efficient features to create light amounts of slippage and distributes the value captured, back to Osmosis token stakers.

A few app-chain, that will be entering the Cosmos soon, are *Nomic* and *Babylon*. Both are providing Bitcoin related services, to bring both Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem.

***Nomic***- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn’t use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side.

Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well in the future.

***Babylon***- Bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. One of the big use cases that can come from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Many Cosmos chains have unbonding times between 14-28 days. However, Babylons service could bring down unbonding times to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it’s security preferences.

***Conclusion***

These two chains have work left to do, before they officially launch, however both plan to have mainnets in 2023. They lay the foundation to bring Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem, without centralized sequencers or 5/8 multisig attack vectors. Creating secure, reliable and decentralized products to make the Cosmos more liquid, and secure than it is today.",16,24,2023-05-30 11:55:39,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Cosmos is hidden gem it needs more recognition than it gets', 6), (""I'm definitely waiting for Nomic 2nd airdrop.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention.

This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities.

This might not sound like the most grandiose of titles, but it does carry weight. Since Doge's inception, countless other meme coins have followed in Doge's footsteps (or pawsteps), including SHIB, Banano and DogelonMars. Whenever these coins receive attention, they are inevitably compared to Doge (in a similar way to how new non-meme coins are often compared to Bitcoin/Ethereum). This creates ever more visibility and demand for Doge, as it is seen as the Bitcoin of meme coins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Doge coin has had serious adoption. To name just a few places one can spend Doge coin, you can spend the meme coin at the Dallas Mavericks, ExpressVPN, Ledger, and airBaltic. That is more adoption than most serious coins. This sort of adoption, and potential for more adoption in the future, makes Doge coin a great investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, memes. The ability to create memes about a coin, without it seeming forced, is a non-trivial marketing tool. One can easily create extra traction and visibility for Doge, allowing Doge to welcome in new investors with ease. Often, other coins try this technique, but it seems insincere and a little on the nose. The ability to meme about a coin, especially in the social media age, is a feature that separates Doge from the rest of the pack.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"here are the Top 10 of Crypto since 2014, what will be top10 2024 for you ?","Cryptos have volatile values, but I think it's interesting to look at the history of the top 10 to try and understand where we are. Right now we're in a well-established bear winter, despite a revival trough as BTC and ETH, or memes token, but the SEC, and successive scandals (hack, hijacking, CEX collapse and others) mean that the trend is negative and unstable.

More great news for the UK crypto users(!)…

— Content —

People tempted to bet their life savings on bitcoin or dogecoin after one cocktail too many are to be protected by a 24-hour cooling-off period for crypto dealing, to be introduced by regulators this year.

Crypto firms marketing themselves in the UK will be required to make new customers wait a day after applying for an account before being allowed to place their first orders, the Financial Conduct Authority has ruled. It also plans to ban “refer a friend” bonuses — the incentives paid to existing crypto customers when they introduce other potential clients to crypto firms.

The FCA announced the adjustments to its rules on the promotion of crypto currencies to UK consumers as it revealed a huge increase in the number of people owning digital currencies. Five million people in Britain now own cryptocurrency products, more than twice as many as previously reported, with the average holding worth £1,595, the City regulator has disclosed.

In one of the first comprehensive surveys into the thinking of crypto owners in the UK, the FCA found that while 40 per cent regarded the pastime as “a gamble” in which they could lose money, 46 per cent were certain they would make money eventually.

Fear of missing out was cited by 19 per cent of buyers as a reason for purchasing, while 21 per cent regarded it as a way of getting rich quick. The research also found that 6 per cent of crypto buyers in its survey — equating to 298,000 people, once scaled up — were financing purchases through credit cards or other borrowing.

While 31 per cent of buyers said they regretted their purchases, 55 per cent were happy trading in crypto and were not concerned that it was unregulated.

The FCA put the number of crypto owners at 4.96 million in August 2022, or 10 per cent of all adults, up from 2.3 million in January 2021, suggesting that millions more people were attracted to the activity as cryptocurrencies were riding high in late 2021.

The “buying at the peak” phenomenon was borne out by the 45 per cent of owners who said they had lost money in the 12 months to April 2022. A third still said they had made money in that period, though this was down from the two thirds asked the same question in respect of the 12 months to April 2021.

Cryptocurrency prices surged in lockdown with the most commonly traded product, bitcoin, hitting a high of more than $64,000 in November 2021. It trades at less than $27,000 today.

The report, based on a nationally representative sample of more than 2,300 adults, also gave the first official clues as to how people in Britain buy crypto. More than 70 per cent used an online exchange and of those, 60 per cent used Coinbase, followed by 28 per cent who used Binance.

The US-listed Coinbase was this week accused by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of operating illegally, sending its shares sliding. The SEC has also sued Binance, accusing it of co-mingling customers’ funds.

Coinbase and Binance both deny wrongdoing.

In the survey, the most popular cryptocurrencies were bitcoin, held by 60 per cent of UK crypto owners, followed by ether and ethereum (48 per cent).

The size of owners’ holdings varied hugely, with 39 per cent saying they owned less than £100 worth. Five per cent of respondents, or 248,000 people, owned more than £10,000 worth, and 16 per cent of owners said they had used crypto to pay for goods and services.

Cryptocurrencies are digitally generated representations of value in which every transaction is recorded on a decentralised database. They are not usually backed by fiat currencies or other assets and are not regarded as money by most governments. There are said to be more than 22,000 different kinds.

Critics say crypto has no intrinsic value and is a bubble driven by greed and favoured by criminals. Supporters say that some cryptocurrencies could one day replace fiat currencies.

Sheldon Mills, an executive director at the City watchdog, said: “It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice.”

Dan Moczulski, UK boss of eToro, which offers crypto trading, welcomed the FCA move but cautioned: “Regulation needs to strike the right balance.”",8,57,2023-06-08 11:03:37,,CryptoCurrency,REGULATIONS,"[('If I can’t buy high immediately, I will still buy high after 24 hours', 6), (""You can't stop someone to buy something they want with their own money because some random dudes are not happy with their past purchases.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

I’ve been thinking about a comment I made once and I get it,"“Back” in 2021, I asked someone who had “been in crypto for five years” why they aren’t rich. 

I get it now.

I started in Dogecoin and as embarrassed to say, Safemoon. Thank the maker that I got out of that barely in the green.

I’ve learned DCA and that Bitcoin is King. Say what you want but there is no denying the best anything to own right now is Bitcoin. I don’t want real estate, I don’t want cars, I don’t want comic books. 

No one with any kind of regulatory authority is even coming close to closely suggesting that Bitcoin is a security. It has been confirmed numerous times as a commodity.

"Crypto.com gave a crazy as well as conflicting response to allegations of acting as their own internal market maker. They admit to having one, contradicting previous employee statements, and also claim but they're necessary for the supposedly ""tight spreads"" that CDC has.","Crypto.com was questioned in allegations as acting as their own market maker. In response, Crypto.com said: “**We have an internal market maker** that operates on the Crypto.com exchange and that internal market maker is treated exactly  the same as third-party market makers that identically facilitate **tight spreads and efficient markets** on our platform.”

This is a very odd statement. First of all, it is a big conflict of interest for an exchange to have their own internal market maker. In addition, this statement directly conflicts with previous statements by internal staff execs and internal staff that CDC who strongly denied it, claiming that CDC doesn't have any internal market making operations. This is raising A LOT of questions about CDC.

But further, for *anyone* who has dealt with CDC, you have realised that they have VERY high spreads. If you don't know, spread is the difference between the offered buying and selling price on the exchange. In fact, CDC probably has the highest spreads on the market. CDC might actually be best known for their high spreads. For them to claim that their internal market maker is necessary for the ""tight spreads"" is wild and just doesn't hold up.

The above video is actually a great one to look into because it has many users who commented also complaining about the spread. And in the video itself, the youtuber shows that Bitoin has a spread of **1.6% on** [**Crypto.com**](https://Crypto.com) **vs 0.2%** **on Binance.** For Dogecoin, the spread shot up to **6.4% vs 0.2% on Binance.**

We know that Binance larger and would be able to offer lower spreads, but having an **8x** increase for Bitcoin and further **32X** increase for Dogecoin compared to Binance is ridiculous.

I can promise you that these are just *some* of the complaints.

On top of this, for USDC in particular CDC was charging users a hidden 1.5% fee for USDC to USD conversions. This began happening after the USDC depeg and no where was the fee disclosed. I cannot confirm that this is still an ongoing issue.You can view most on that here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/123nojp/cryptocom\_now\_charges\_at\_least\_a\_15\_fee\_for\_usdc/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/123nojp/cryptocom_now_charges_at_least_a_15_fee_for_usdc/)

But here's my analysis and reasoning:  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Why bullish on CRO for this month?:\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Crypto . com app has suffered a major hack situation recently, causing the price to plummet 50 cents down from its 90 cent ATH. (price of 1 CRO is approximately 40 cents at the time of this writing). Unless another hacking problem disturbs CRO (which is highly unlikely as the company probably set higher firewall system) the price will most likely correct itself to higher position.  Buy low, sell high, and right now, CRO price is very low.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Although I cannot find recent news on CRO on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com), this seems very strange to me. Crypto . com company, who has bought the former Staples Center, and is a very widely used exchange, stays this quiet. Of course, the situation with the hack most likely caused CRO company to back off the socials, but this also means that unless CRO want to go bankrupt, CRO company will release a news that will pump the coin's price.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Additionally, despite all this commotion, the number of CRO addresses increased, meaning that the situation has not decreased the amount of users of CRO.\n&gt; \n&gt; And in the overall picture of the crypto market, we can clearly see that the market is down by a lot. Bitcoin is down to 37k, which is very low considering the fact that it has been traded at near 70k few months ago. Most likely Bitcoin will rise, and as bitcoin rises, so will other cryptos like CRO.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is more of an analysis/opinion of mine, for more detailed info, please DYOR, theres bunch of information available on wikipedia and other crypto news sites. Its just a few clicks away from research, I did not want this post to be another wiki page.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It also has an exchange that\'s still not available in the US (though finally open for waitlist).\n&gt; \n&gt; I was their customer for 1.5 years, but left a month ago. It\'s frustrating seeing how much they spend on marketing and influencers instead of improving their platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; - **Better competitors**: CDC\'s has many competitors with more features, lower fees, or better and easier-to-navigate websites/apps. CDC\'s platform tries to do many things, but it does everything subpar. The only thing that makes it really stand out is their debit card, which offers higher APY benefits for CRO and its earning platform if you stake large amounts of CRO. Though given how they\'ve been slashing rewards across the platform, we don\'t know how long they can maintain their popularity through those rates. I\'ve always suspected that these are promo rates that are only being maintained through their higher fees being charged everywhere else on their platform. (May 1st edit - CDC completely slashed their rewards for their cards: https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-visa-cards-update. Except for the 2 highest and most risky tiers of staking, there\'s no point to using this card anymore. They\'ve destroyed the best part of their platform.)\n&gt; - **Focuses on marketing, not product** - CDC relied on marketing strategies that were designed to attract as many customers to their platform. Many basic features have been neglected. ACH transfers (specifically pulls) from banks did not exist until recently. Nearly all of its CeFi competitors (Gemini, BlockFi, Celsius, Nexo) have a desktop app for their main platform. CDC\'s platform is mobile-only and has been for years. I suppose its Exchange has a desktop site, but that isn\'t available in the US, and most of CDC\'s features are not related to its exchange. Instead, they focused on buying up tons of advertising (Stapes Center, Matt Damon\'s ""Fortune Favors the Brave"" campaign, LeBron James campaign) when they could\'ve improved their products.\n&gt; - **No US exchange**: Every couple of months, CDC\'s owners state that the US platform is coming in 1-2 months. I\'ve been waiting since the start of 2021. They dropped multiple hints of a summer 2021 release, later delayed to Q4 2021. Now it\'s finally been released, but there\'s a waitlist for institutional investors, and we don\'t know if it\'ll be ready before the end of the year for the rest of us.\n&gt; - **Massive spread and fees**: Those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have access to the exchange end up paying massive spread and fees compared to its competitors. It\'ll depend on what you buy, but the fees/spread are often 5x larger than those of Binance. It\'s not uncommon for fees to end up costing 3-5% of the transaction.\n&gt; - **Lack of app security** - There is no password protection or 2 factor authentication for login on the mobile app. When you sign in, it sends your email address a link to use, making email the single point of failure. It was only after the Jan 18th hack that 2-factor was forced on, and even then it is only used for withdrawals and for bank-related settings changes--not for login. They need to take security more seriously.\n&gt; - **Poor handling of the Jan 18 hack** - 400 accounts were hacked [by bypassing 2FA on Jan 18, with $33M stolen](https://cryptobriefing.com/days-after-alleged-33m-hack-crypto-com-still-silent/). Even worse, CDC forcefully-disabled 2FA on all accounts without warning. Barely any customers received emails about CDC crippling their 2FA. People only found out through social media or logging into their apps. They do have ISO IEC 27701 certification, but that\'s for privacy, and it\'s a joke to market it as security certification.\n&gt; - **Poor handling of MCO swap** - Before CRO, CDC used a different ICO token to fund their platform called MCO. They cannibalized MCO to fund CRO, forcing everyone to swap to CRO at a fixed rate without adequate warning.\n&gt; - **Too many large US banks block CDC**: My banks and credit cards work perfectly fine with Coinbase, Gemini, BlockFi, Binance US, Kraken, and FTX US. The only one they block is CDC. I don\'t know why so many large banks block it, but I suspect it was due to too many reports of shady activity or upset customers. The only way around this for many banks is to perform an ACH push from the bank side. Using CDC was the first time in 20 years I had to do an ACH push.\n&gt; - **High withdrawal minimums** - Many of CDC\'s popular coins require a [minimum withdrawal of $25-50](https://crypto.com/exchange/document/fees-limits), and they still charge you a large withdrawal fee. Most ERC20 withdrawals are $25, and the BTC withdrawal is currently $20. Minimum withdrawal for fiat is $100. You\'re going to see high withdrawals unless you use their congested Cronos network or BEP20.\n&gt; - **Cronos network often congested** - Since launch, their Cronos network has often been congested. It can take anywhere from a couple minutes to a full day to transfer any token. That\'s exceptionally bad for a mostly-centralized network that\'s modeled similarly to Binance Smart Chain. There was massive congestion in early April 2022 due to some coin launches. If they\'re getting congestion this early on, they\'re not going to be able to handle anywhere near BSC-levels of network activity.\n&gt; - **Larger rewards require staking and locking CRO for 180 days** - Too many rewards require staking CRO for 180 days, during which it is completely locked. Many users bought CRO above $0.90 and couldn\'t sell when it halved in value. This is a huge risk.\n&gt; - **Loot boxes** - CDC has gamified their platform and introduced loot/gacha boxes that provide trivial rewards for completing small tasks or making purchases. The rewards are embarrassingly small (nickle to dime values), and they\'re eclipsed by the higher fees paid to reach those rewards. You\'re better off using a cheaper platform for trades.\n&gt; - **Cultish social media community** - Fortunately, this is no longer a big issue now that CRO has fallen 60% from its all-time high price. CRO investors who joined late 2021 have now had time to experience the massive flaws of CDC\'s platform and woken up from their drunken stupor. But rewinding to around the time CDC bought the naming rights to the former Staples Arena, CRO went viral and shot up 5x. For the next 6 months, their community went from slightly cultish to absolutely and unbearably irrational (similar to the Loopring and SafeMoon communities). There are still many CRO shills and way too many pictures of people\'s debit cards, but the community is much more balanced now.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The App and the Exchange are completely separate parts of CDC’s global business, they work differently and have different legal implications.  This is exactly why very recently that CDC shut down its US Exchange for Institutional Investors only, as it would clearly become a target of the SEC after their statement, regarding coins identified as securities.   This Exchange was the test case for the US before opening one to general public/retail, the test was required due to the lack of rules from the US government/SEC.  \n\nThe spread in the App and exchange are completely different and can not be compared as they function differently.  There’s always been opportunities for anyone to use a competing App/Exchange, there’s been years of FUD against CDC.

Therefore, their compliance and certification is in very good shape and they’re geared up to address these issues before they can happen.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

As a result, there will always be a limitless supply of Doge that anyone can mine or buy. Simply put, DOGEs will be available indefinitely. It's not a suitable option to store value because of its inflationary nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; **No innovation**\n&gt; \n&gt; The Luckycoin cryptocurrency, which was a derivative of Litecoin and is now dead, served as the inspiration for the original Dogecoin programming. Dogecoin's pricing is based on how much the community believes the cryptocurrency should sell for. They also choose the price and timing for exchanging the cryptocurrency for others that have solid fundamentals supporting their value, which demonstrates that individuals view doge more as a way to become rich quick than as an investment opportunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price manipulation via pump and dumps**\n&gt; \n&gt; A pro for dogecoin was its community and meme culture that was created by Elon Musk and WSB, that makes doge pump and dump based on Elon's tweets.

Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))\n&gt; \n&gt; # PROs\n&gt; \n&gt; **It's Decentralized**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. No need for a central authority\n&gt; 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)\n&gt; 3. Ledger is distributed and public\n&gt; 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner\n&gt; 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address\n&gt; 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source\n&gt; \n&gt; **Provides Privacy**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Security**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network.

Mining fees and settlement times have varied so much over the last few years that it is simply not a reliable platform for transactions.  Without predictable fees, a business can\'t build a budget; without predictable settlement times, businesses can\'t sell products efficiently.  \n&gt; \n&gt; A proposed solution for the speed and cost issue is the Lightning network, but unfortunately this again is inconsistent.  Lighting is not a network-wide upgrade, so transactions don\'t all use the ""new"" system.  A business can\'t commit to using Bitcoin if the transaction will probably settle quickly; they need to *know*.\n&gt; \n&gt; The market price of Bitcoin is an additional inconsistency.  If the price changed slowly over months or years businesses could adopt it, but when it sometimes changes hour-by-hour it\'s too unpredictable to use when selling products or services.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some propose that Bitcoin could be simply a store of value - an asset rather than a transactional currency.  Unfortunately that makes it just a collectible: it has value only as long as other people also want it.  Unless Bitcoin finds a way to have commercial value, it will hold value as ineffectively as Beanie Babies and stamp collections.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final nail in the coffin may be the unfortunate and perhaps unfair perception issues in our media.  Bitcoin is featured in stories about exchange fraud, environmental concerns, and rebel groups like ""Freedumb"" convoys.  Whether you think those issues have merit or not, most businesses prefer to avoid things that are volatile and controversial.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Bitcoin to grow and be valuable it has to be commercially useful.  In most stable economies fiat currency can be sent between people or spent by consumers at any time, instantly, and without transaction fees.  BTC can not make those same promises, and brings with it unpredictability and uncertainty.  Unless Bitcoin makes dramatic changes it is doomed to fail in the end.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Upon review of these DApps, their perceived quality is on par if not more polished that something we'd see on other largely available L1 solutions, all while still in beta states. \n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, not everything is fun &amp; games, the network has a serious congestion problem going on, and triying to use it might end up feeling clunky at times, which might lead some people to believe it really offers nothing when compared to Ethereum, until you factor in that Cardano's smart contract feature was released **barely 7 months ago**, versus ETH's *8 years* of advantage. \n&gt; One could make the case that if Cardano is able to match/approach ETH's throughput while maintaining small fees in so little time when compared to the OG smart contract network, It no doubt has a bright future ahead. It has beat it already when it means to reaching functional PoS consensus, something ETH has failed to achieve while professing it's about to happen for at least 5 years already. \n&gt; \n&gt; The soil is fertile and well kept, providing a strong foundation for future smart contract implementation, increased throughput through Hydra scaling, sharding, subnets, and it's scalability doesn't rely on soft/hard forking either, it can all be achieved from the L1 itself without introducing L2's which all in all might still become a thing in the future, taking the network to a new paradigm of blazing fast, uncostly transactions.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

This essentially means that if you imagine ethereum as the highway polygon is one of the exits you can take. Now the value of polygon is going to be obvious to anyone who's ever tried to move eth, gas fees. The ethereum blockchain suffers from massive gas fees which means that moving it from say your exchange to your wallet is already costing you a fair chunk depending on traffic, upwards of 20 bucks isn't rare.\n&gt; Enter polygon!\n&gt; A lot of us small fries can't bother with that kind of gas so the matic chain offers a necessary escape. At time of writing about 0.0001 dollar or 33 gwei is the average gas fee on matic, the difference and thus the accessibility is obvious.\n&gt; Last thing I want to mention is a natural consequence of these low gas fees a healthy DeFi community has sprung up on this blockchain. Now if you're not interested just know that utilization of a blockchain is a solid way for a blockchain to be worth something. For those of you who are interested I suggest trying it out, after all gas fees is so low you can just try it out without spending too much.\n&gt; Final addition, matic is also making sure adoption is solid by partnering with crypto bluechips like aave, curve and sushiswap and also with an online platform called draftkings for betting.\n&gt; So all in all utilizing the power of eth without the massive gas fees which has allowed for a healthy community to form around it.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It has its own network security, but staking is still done on the Ethereum network and requires paying expensive Ethereum smart contract gas fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, going from Layer 1 Ethereum to Polygon is mainly done through the Polygon PoS bridge, which also costs expensive Ethereum gas fees. (This will gradually phase out as more CEXs provide direct onramp to the Polygon PoS network.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Has plenty of competitors**\n&gt; \n&gt; There are just too many competitors, which dilutes adoption and liquidity for Polygon\'s ecosystem. While Polygon PoS isn\'t a direct competitor to most Layer 2 rollups and monolithic ""Ethereum killers"" because it is designed from ground up to be Ethereum sidechain, it does experience indirect competition. And the other Polygon Layer 2 rollup projects are direct competitors. As of Jan 2021, Polygon Hermez is only in [17th place in TLV](https://l2beat.com/).\n&gt; \n&gt; **Less resistant to DDoS attacks**\n&gt; \n&gt; Like all networks with low transaction fees, it at risk to DDoS attacks since the barrier to making transactions is low\n&gt; \n&gt; In early Jan 2022, [Sunflowers Farm \\(SFF\\) unintentionally DDoS-attacked the Polygon PoS network](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) and completely congested the network because it was more profitable to play the game and spam transactions than pay network fees. Transaction fees shot up 20x. Eventually, a hacker exploited the SFF game and reduced its price to zero, and users rejoiced because it cleared the congestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Centralized governance of the PoS chain**\n&gt; \n&gt; Governance is currently centralized.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Polygon team single-handedly [increased the transaction fee from 1 to 30 Gwei in Oct 2021](https://thedefiant.io/polygon-transaction-fee-hike/) to combat spammers. They didn\'t communicate this with the community or ask for feedback ahead of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Polygon team also [secretly hard-forked the network](https://cryptobriefing.com/a-hacker-stole-1-6m-after-exploiting-a-polygon-bug/) by pushing out a patch 1 day after a hacker stole $1.6M from the network from the Polygon PoS genesis contract in Dec 2021. The team didn\'t publicize the reason for the emergency patch until over 3 weeks later.\n&gt; \n&gt; They have only very recently starting looking to decentralize governance through a [Polygon Ecosystem DAO](https://blog.polygon.technology/state-of-governance-decentralization/), but that could be a long time away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the top 4 staking validators out of a total of 100 validators [own 49% of the supply](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/) of MATIC, but the staking validators are only used for validation and [block production](https://forum.matic.network/t/matic-system-overview-bor/126), not governance.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Split attention on multiple projects**\n&gt; \n&gt; For better or worse, Polygon is working on multiple Layer 2 solutions (Polygon PoS, Hermez, Zero, Miden, Nightfall, Avail) and constantly researching different protocols. This is a rather Google-like decision to have multiple competiting products where it becomes the Jack-of-all-trades, Master-of-none. Some of these protocols are really exciting, but the crypto community doesn\'t know about them because there are too many to focus on.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Tokenomics of MATIC Tokens**\n&gt; \n&gt; The MATIC token has limited utility. It\'s used for staking (validation and block production). Once the pool of staking rewards runs out of funds, all staking rewards will need to come from transaction fees, which are tiny. Currently only 75% of the coins are in circulation, and the Polygon Team has an ongoing [token release schedule](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/matic-network) for dumping tokens on the open market.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Disclaimer: I currently do not own any MATIC.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The freedom that artists enjoy with their NFT works on Solana is enormous. This is mostly caused by the other blockchains' technical shortcomings. Fast processing times and affordable prices enable artists to produce works that, for instance, would be too expensive to mint on Ethereum.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Retail investors should be cautious of investing in Solana until the upcoming **QUIC** and **Localized Fee Prioritizations** fix the ongoing outage and stability issues with the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Way too many outages\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the biggest problems with Solana is that it has had way too many outages ever since its Mainnet launch. It's had at least [4 major outages, 3 partial outages](https://status.solana.com/uptime), and numerous congestions caused by DDoS attacks (some unintentional) in the 9 months between Sept 2021 and Jun 2022. That's way more than most of its competitors. These numerous outages have ruined its reputation in the crypto community.\n&gt; \n&gt; The network is very vulnerable to DoS attacks, which have brought down the network many times. In Sept 2021, a [DoS attack flooded the entire network](https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview) to the point it could not recover for almost a full day. In Jan 21-22, 2022, [bots brought down the network](https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/) with excessive duplicate transactions. A similar DDoS attack happened on Apr 30, when a [NFT minting bots took down the network](https://solana.com/news/04-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report-mitigation) with 4M TPS of spam.\n&gt; \n&gt; During DDoS attacks, validators continue forwarding transactions to the leader. Since there is no mempool, the leader has to keep up with the traffic. If the leader can't keep up, the transaction drops and the user has to resubmit it. When congested and attacked by  DDOS, the number of forks increases greatly, and leaders end up picking branches quickly and inaccurately, often extending empty blocks. This ends up reducing throughput of valid transactions and creating wasted forks. For example, during the Jan 21-22 attacks, the true throughput fell to 140 TPS. It's really easy for DDoS attacks to create a disruptive positive feedback loop that shuts down the whole network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Blockchain Design\n&gt; \n&gt; **Slower Finality**\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to the design of Proof of History consensus, Solana has probabilistic finality with a moderate chance of wasted forks. It takes [32 blocks before any transaction is final](https://docs.solana.com/proposals/block-confirmation). At 2.5s per block, this means 80 seconds. Users will see their transactions posted in 2.5s. If there's no congestions, they can probably wait 10s and assume it's probabilistically final. But if there's congestion, lots of skipped blocks, and people DDoS'ing the network, it's not deterministically final until they wait 80 seconds. This is much slower than many of their competitors, which have 2-10s deterministic finality.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Exaggerated/Useless TPS metrics**\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana's reported 50K TPS in ideal conditions is completely exaggerated.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, that number is based on a 400 ms slot time, but the current slot time is around 600-800 ms, which reduces the ideal TPS 25-50%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana also exaggerates their throughput by including non-useful transactions in their metrics. This includes vote transactions, which account for 70-90% of transactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; The count of valid TPS (excluding vote transactions and erroneous transactions) is much lower. About 80-85% of transactions are either vote transactions that are used for consensus or erroneous transactions. The true [non-vote TPS limit is much lower at around **400-600 TPS**](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/cc7a0d94-7f70-46f4-aae4-2f8810430931#theme=night) when the network isn't congested. As of June 2022, on average only 15% of total counted transactions are working transactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, validators routinely skip blocks, encounter bad forks, or post empty blocks. Even when there's no congestion, validator's unweighed skip rate is [10-25% of blocks](https://solanabeach.io/validators).\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Opaque Ledger and Block Explorer\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana has several explorers, and all of them are very opaque. The official explorer doesn't allow you to browse blocks and transactions, and it's practical useless. Solana Beach is probalby the best explorer, but it too shows almost no data except for the address and transaction fee. It is very confusing trying to decipher these transactions. There's almost no information on the identity of validators. Both of the main explorers are very slow and often stall when querying details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another part of Solana's obscurity is the 30% of the total supply of SOL that is non-circulating but staked. It's supposedly owned by the Solana Foundation. This has been discussed several times by developers on Discord, but no one seems to understand why it's there and how they're using it. It also doesn't help that Solana's main explorer and Solana Beach explorer won't load details about its non-circulating supply.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unable to Audit Smart Contracts**\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the worst issue on Solana (even worse than the outages) is that you can't audit smart contracts. When you use a smart contract on Solana, you are blindly trusting that it does what it says it'll do. There's not a single Solana Explorer that currently shows smart contract code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Developers can publish their source code on another website, but they can also redeploy their on-chain contract at the same address. So users don't have a reliable method of trusting source code published off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Poor Tokenomics\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction fees are 99% subsidized by Staking Rewards, which feed back into SOL as supply inflation**\n&gt; \n&gt; Like many networks, the low transaction fees are not enough to pay for the cost of running the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is expected to make [$12M in transaction fees in this year going by the current 30-day average]( https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana). Staking rewards is expected to [pay out around $1.4B in SOL in 2022](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile/supply-schedule). That means 99.1% of validator rewards are being paid by staking rewards instead of the artificially-low transaction fees. And staking rewards inflate the supply of the SOL token.\n&gt; \n&gt; Total supply inflation for staking started out [at 8% and gradually declines by 15% annually until it reaches 1.5%](https://docs.solana.com/inflation/inflation_schedule). Note that this is an underestimate because these calculations are based on total supply, not circulating supply, which is 30% smaller. Messari currently lists [circulating supply inflation as 7.4%](https://messari.io/screener/supply-and-marketcap-EB1755C2).\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is fully-vested as of Jan 2022, though there is a 30% gap between the recorded circulating and total supply because most of the [Foundation's staked SOL](https://explorer.solana.com/supply?filter=nonCirculating) is not included in circulating supply. (Their Explorer website barely has any supply details or charts, and doesn't even loading half of the time, so it's hard to investigate.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ##Other Points\n&gt; \n&gt; **Requires insecure bridges to other networks**\n&gt; \n&gt; Solana is a bit isolated from other blockchains. It requires insecure bridges to connect to other networks, which is also an issue for many other networks. Bridges often get exploited, like the [Feb 2022 $320M Solana Wormhole hack](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/320-million-stolen-from-wormhole-bridge-linking-solana-and-ethereum.html). Solana needs a safer cross-chain protocol if it wants to communicate safely with other networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **High validator requirements**\n&gt; \n&gt; The minimum requirements for validators are 12-cores and 128GB of memory. 300 Mbit internet server is preferred.

I also bought into some NFTs in 2021-2022 and decided to just liquidate everything and go all in on Pepe once I saw how that ""$250 into 2 million"" narrative was starting to trend like crazy. In the first 5 days I invested probably about 15k into Pepe. Anyone that had invested in NFT from 2021-2022 is down so bad that so many people started liquidating everything, throwing it into Pepe and making profits. You saw this massive shift of people dumping all their NFTs and going into shitcoins to try and make a profit.

I was obviously early on Pepe...and almost all the typical NFT influencers or crypto accounts on Twitter just straight up shit on Pepe and said its a rug and it almost did an inverse Cramer effect . Where people that got wrecked in NFTs by NFTs influencers said fuck you I\'m dumping your shit and buying this. If anything I think it was more a movement of people realizing the NFT grift and how they were taken advantage of. I know that sounds crazy but there was for sure a mass exodus out of NFTs into shitcoins due to Pepe.

He finds it hilarious I\'ll put in $100 and end up with 5k in a weekend sometimes.
