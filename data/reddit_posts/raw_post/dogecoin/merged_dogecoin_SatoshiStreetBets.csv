How and Why I came into Investing in $SSB (Previously known as Derpy) and #SatoshiSwap (Might take around 3 to 4 mins of your reading time).,"In late 2020, a friend  of my introduce me to the world of Cypto. It took me a few weeks of researching what was it all about and the various coins on the market. I made my 1st purchase in Doge on Feb 3rd 2021 at around $0.04 (FYI I miss my initial entry in Dec 2020 when prices were below 1 cent as I was still not comfortable in investing in Crypto)  and subsequently into Shiba Inu, Safemoon, ...etc. I have to be frank I was quite lucky in a sense that I got in early before the real pumps came in and overall made 10x what I put in after offsetting the losses in some shit coins and con jobs (using the 4 points written below). 

Along the way I refined the basis of of my entries after going into Wall Street Bets and subsequently by chance into Satoshi Street Bets. It was here that I came to set up my personal ""Crypto Investment Philosophy"" or ""CIP"" as I would like to call it 

1) Coins with real world utility or striving towards it;

2) Coins backed by Strong Communities (hardcore);

3)  A team of dedicated founders and developers; and 

4) Good trading volume

Along the way I notice a frequent person posting known as Little Eagle and little did I know that that person was actually David Gilbert the founder of this group until subsequently *(FYI I was scanning daily through this reddit group and a couple of others for coins meeting my 4 criteria)* so one day he mentioned that he wanted to come up with his own brand of Coins with some utility of a margin trading Dex so I decided to keep in view the developments. 

As the weeks pass by in 2021 and more details were released I come to a decision to invest into Derpy and Swap and did the Whitelisting and KYC and participated in Copper Launch *(FYI I did not sleep for almost 48 hours by checking the prices every 30 mins as I am very careful of where I put my money into, I even made a forecast of the price decay and it was almost 95% correct and happy to say I bought in at almost the bottom when the volume and prices started deviating from my forecast.).* The actual reasons for me to invest was due to the very stringent criteria needed to buy the coins and the reasoning David gave which was not like those pump and dump coins where whales swoop in and then sell, rekting the small fishes. I studied the entire whitelisting process, search on Diamond Hands Consulting Pte Ltd, the Law firm appointed, ...etc

And so the journey started, along the way certain elements of the Margin Trading Dex were altered and deadlines were pushed but it was all explained in a transparent fashion and boy did the evolution of the utility products evolved into a more sophisticated product then what was initially mentioned. Over the months the numbers of Wen Moon/ lambo boys came down and the telegram group was left with a group of dedicated investors. Its frankly very heartening to see David and the developers continuing to build over the crypto winter. The money gained during presale is still around and not rugged and you can check it in the blockchain yourselves. 

Around late 2022, David came and told us that he had won a lawsuit against the fake SSB coin. I took it up and started searching for whatever information that is publicly available and came across the court proceedings at the New York Circuit Court, the name of the Judge, the Trademark applications and the various jurisdictions the Trademark has been applied for.  This put me in a position where my trust in David and the team has risen up a few notches as you know litigations are not a small matter and to have the dedication to see it through and win makes it even more admirable especially is that it was won in America where there is a lot of bias towards crypto recently with operation chock point 2 in progress. I have to admit that I have been interested and invested in this project way before the 99% who came in recently and have seen the progress made over year. 

To those new investors, currently the progress of the Charting Platform is in its final Beta form and quite a number (more then 50 of them as far as I am aware) of the regulars at the SatoshiSwap telegram has been testing it although I do feel a tad disappointed not to have been one of them but hey thats life and you can't always be at pole position. As for the Dex as far as I know is that it has gone through 2 audits and is almost ready to be integrated with the Charting Platform. I read thoroughly through the 1st Audit Report and the minor issues found. 

Overall the final product is almost coming to fruition and the bull market is almost upon us, its like Crypto spring at the moment and the products and integration is almost on hand. You should really go read up at [https://ssbcoin.com/](https://ssbcoin.com/) and [https://satoshiswap.net/](https://satoshiswap.net/) for more information related to the 2 coins.

$PEPE is Ready to make Tendies only IF*,"So let me start with some classic dope things: this is NFA so DYOR, dance YMCA while singing BYOB, put your NASA suit, and don’t be a FED because I will call the FBI and CIA before going to MOON. 

Ok I think we are good to go. Let’s see how far my autism let me… never mind.  

An ERC-20 Token called $pepe was created on April 14th on the ETH blockchain with only 4 ETH of liquidity and it was well received by the crypto community + NFT community in matter of days in such a massive way that it brought the memecoin season to crypto by storm soaring over 4000x in only 19 days reaching 1.6B dollars of Marketcap. 

Ok that’s the relevant data because we ain’t looking for utility or any shit like that, this is not a security remember that, we only want the price goes up so we can pay our wife’s boyfriend trip to the Bahamas before summer ends. 

Pepe is not anymore a memecoin, is a “culture coin” and it can be compared only to Bitcoin (until it flips it). 

Warning: I can make a full explanation of why $pepe will be better than BTC, so don’t mess with me because you will dump every single asset to go all in on $pepe. 

*CURRENT $PEPE SITUATION* :

$pepe right now is taking his time to accumulate or whatever the fuck that means because BTC puked himself due to the villain of this year G.G (ifykyk, good game) BUT! that doesn’t mean anything to a frog that’s able to Jump really high, in fact the frogs can jump even 50 times their length (source: Internet) , and I think this calcule is kinda conservative due to the fact that this frog is the Giga Chad Frog of the internet, so, would be kinda retard think that this will act like a normal frog. 

*WHAT CAN YOU DO*

Buy $pepe and wait till you get rich. 

Bloomberg will never recommend this because I heard that Mike doesn’t like the frogs because when he was a kid one jumped on his face and that event was turned into a childhood trauma. 

*And now the IF*

$pepe will jump ONLY IF you start dumping the dog coins because at this point they are worthless, any influencer telling you to buy any dog coin is a scammer and you will be their exit liquidity, SO DO NOT DO IT. The last time Elon tweeted about doge the price didn’t even reacted, and that’s because Elon lost his dog magic sauce… But don’t forget that $Pepe is the most memeable THING in the world, and Elon loves memes and he knows that he needs to be really careful about his tweets because if he adds a frog, $pepe jumps 40%, just think about it.

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021.

Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago.

Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility?

Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. 

imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors.

Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market.

The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market.
