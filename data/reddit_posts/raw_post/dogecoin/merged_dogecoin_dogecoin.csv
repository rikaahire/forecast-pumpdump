Literally crashing to ZERO value, never to recover. And that’s because without rewards, people won’t mine, and low hashrate would make it far too easy and lucrative for someone to carry off a successful 51% and destroy the coin.\n\nSo, having put the cap BS to rest, what about the $1?\n\nPut simply, people are smoking too much Hopium.

Or they may be trying to manipulate the market, as in a pump and dump scam. Or they may just be very foolish.\n\nBut regardless, every single trade must have BOTH a buyer AND a seller. So if the price gets pushed up, it won’t be long before sellers notice and flood in with their cheap coins, thus pulling the price back down.\n\nTo be clear, IF we ever hit $1, it won’t last more than a minute or two, because so many people will dump everything and ride off into the sunset with bags full of cash.\n\nSo no, $1 is not realistic. Certainly not long term.\n\nWhat IS realistic however is sustained, long term growth. Like we’ve seen recently, with each series of waves trending slightly higher. This type of growth comes from real change, not hype. Increasing numbers of people holding coins, increased utility and acceptance, significant technical improvements, these are things which support increased value.\n\nDoge is the #1 best actual currency in all of crypto. It’s really easy to use, widely held and traded, very liquid, and is supported by the best community in crypto.

Will they be safe there or I need to move somewhere safer ? can you share any tips or guides on how to do that ? I have heard talks about cold wallets , But the concept I find difficult to wrap my head around 😞 . 

yours answers are much welcomes .",7,4,2023-04-15 15:50:10,,dogecoin,,"[('Exchanges are for Exchanging. \n\nIf they go out of business, your coins are theirs and you get to wait a couple years to eventually get a percentage of the value your coins had at the time of bankruptcy.\n\nThere are plenty of links in the pinned topics (how to buy; daily discussion) and the side-bar of the sub. \n\nBut cold wallets are not more complicated than hot wallets. The only difference is that cold wallets are not connected to the internet, while hot wallets are.', 6), ('You need to get your crypto, no matter what it is, off exchanges and into a wallet. I prefer my Trezor but that is because I feel better using a cold storage device.', 3), ('What’s complicated about wallets, exactly? They’re just numbers, after all. Is ‘7’ complicated? 42? 3586422686325785?\n\nHere’s a few wallets from walletgenerator for example….       \n^1,""DSfvzqyC1a3Ea1B4zTPW2tdtQ53QheMUUR"",""6JV8J7EJyDXm65Mgh535N26PHp9x8hweXa4pBFTwCFjukvmPnDM""\n^2,""D84nHtiY382bqmbmW3RfDWarEaTYp1dG2e"",""6KRxaLFGbjU73drqxLp98Y7aYqcMJdk8fekA2mstounu1nTXbhj""\n^3,""DJzkY8NKyGBsrv5tGq7QwMmBu9mfBNWdmP"",""6KVAsfj5tBpP5DRAxBSuXXnLCSsjbPutPQd7rHdwT74gqvcc2P6""\n\nIf you copy those into a text file, you have some wallets. Simple. Of course, not those wallets, since everybody has the keys now, but you can go to walletgenerator.net and run off a few thousand in the bulk tab. Why thousands? Because you want them to mellow like fine wine for as long as possible before using them. That’s to guard against potential issues, which have been reported in years gone by.\n\nFurthermore, you want to store all wallets offline and never let them near the internet, especially after you load coins into them. So multiple copies on removable media, stored in safe places where they won’t all get destroyed in a fire, flood or whatever.\n\nThen all you need is a way to spend coins. And coinb.in does that, and it can (and should) be downloaded and run locally and offline. Just put a copy on those removable media alongside your text wallets. Simple.\n\nPlus, you can play with coinb.in using any wallet at all, even if you don’t have the keys. It’s a great way to learn, so just grab one of the top 100 richest wallets on bitinfocharts and have a go.\n\nOnce you’ve had a play and learned the ropes, pick one of your aged wallets, add a suitable comment to label what that wallet is for, and send coins to it from your exchange. Simple. Oh, and if you’re in a hurry to use a wallet immediately, you can use coinb.in to generate one offline. Just make sure you save it in your wallet masterfile with the others.\n\nNow, something else to consider. You really want many wallets. Because this spreads the risk, improves privacy and helps with auditing.\n\nAt a minimum, you want one wallet paired with every entity or purpose you interact with. So you would have a wallet for Binance, one for SoDogeTip, one for donations on a webpage, one for buying stuff, one for each friend you transact with, and so on and so forth. You can even have one for carrying coins around. Just take a copy of that one wallet and put it in a note on your phone, and put a few bucks in it.\n\nThis way, a single compromised key doesn’t lose all your coins. Oh, and never ever delete any key. Even if it is compromised, or if the service it was used for dies. Just mark it as compromised or dead in your file. Why, you may ask? Because you have no control over people sending coins. I once found 65,000 Doge in a ‘dead’ wallet, which I presume was someone tipping me directly for some reason 🤷\u200d♂️. If I’d thrown away the key, those coins would have been lost.\n\nNow, do be sure you read the ELI5s. And search here for ‘text wallet’ for more info. And ask if you’re still unsure about something. Plenty of people here are happy to help.\n\nAnd yes, definitely get your coins off exchanges. Because any wallet you do not have the keys to, isn’t your wallet. And many exchanges and other services have collapsed and lost people’s coins.', 3), ('I hold off-exchange, in a mix of ""paper wallets"", ""core"" wallets, and ledger devices.  So as you can tell, my opinion is don\'t hold your coins on the exchange or platform.  We\'ve seen people lose it all because their specific exchange/platform collapsed.\n\nThat being said, there are downsides to holding off-exchange.  You become 100% responsible for your technical know-how and security measures. Many many people have lost their crypto when holding it themselves, due to hacking, ignorance, incompetence, and bad luck, among other things.\n\nSo there is an argument to be made for holding crypto on-exchange.  But only each individual can decide for themselves, and weigh the risks.  You could leave your coins on Binance, and lose your coins if Binance disappears.  Or you could withdraw your coins to a ledger and forget your pin/recover-phrase, and lose your coins that way.  Or you withdraw to a ""paper wallet"", and your dog eats the paper, and lose your coins.  Or the maid finds your recovery phrase or wallet info and steals your coins.  Countless scenarios to lose your crypto on or off exchange.\n\nSo do your own due diligence.  Also if you decide to withdraw from an exchange, before committing the full amount to your choice of self custody storage, practice practice practice. And then, practice some more.  When I do transfers, I quadruple check sending/receiving addresses, make sure it\'s the right address for the coin type (don\'t send dogecoin to a bitcoin wallet, for example, it\'s likely to be unrecoverable), and always do ""test sends"" first of small small amounts and wait for confirmations, and that you see the balances move the way you expect. \n\nFulvio is the master of ""paper wallets"", but I do think one needs to practice quite a bit to get comfortable with his system.  A ledger is easier, but has it\'s pitfalls as well.  It\'s not that easy, and you end up learning ""the ledger way"", which might not be all that educational.  And you also have to buy two of them, or face the possibility of a single device failing at the worst possible time, creating delays and possibly huge problems.  \n\n\nLosing $3200 isn\'t life ending for anyone, but let\'s say doge creates a new floor at $1, that\'s $38,000 in value you could lose if you make a mistake.  Practice builds experience, and experience builds confidence. You have plenty to think about.', 2)]"

Do you see whats going to happen when dogecoin payment for Twitter subscriptions is enabled?,"Elon Musk keeps mentioning that creators on Twitter will get all the proceeds from subscriptions minus transaction fees. See these tweets:

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241)

The current fees for IOS/Android are 30% so creators will only keep 70% of the money subscribers pay, and the fee for the web via Credit Card/Stripe is 8% so creators will only keep 92% of the the money subscribers pay.

If layer one dogecoin payments are enabled the fees will be as low as .001 doge (or basically free). With the transaction fees being so low with a dogecoin payment option, creators will get 99.999999% of the subscription fee. If the creators get this much more via a dogecoin payment method it follows that of course a lot of creators will push for their subscribers to use dogecoin and a lot of their subscribers will because they would rather their money go to the person they are subscribing to rather than Android/Apple/CC companies.

If a large amount of big twitter accounts, many of which are not even crypto related, are asking their subscribers to pay in Dogecoin how do you think that will play out? 🚀",142,55,2023-04-18 11:18:03,,dogecoin,,"[(""It'll be massive in the short-term.

Old stolen and lost wallets from Cryptsy SERIOUS POST,"# Old stolen and lost wallets from Cryptsy SERIOUS POST

So as many of us know a few lucky guys got access to the old servers in Miami and was able to retain the interest in some of these massive consolidated wallets.

Millions were lost millions and millions. Lots of us I’m sure are also having a hard time figuring out why on earth our old mined doge was put in Cryptsy.

The settlers of the case need to release and make open for claims of doge and other misc coins. Or those who have the wallets and haven’t cashed out, I beg of you, please allow claims and give back to the community.

Literally life changing amounts of dogecoin.

My serious DOGE/Robinhood dilemma. Crowdsourcing my RH wallet fate.,"I want to pull my DOGE from Robinhood so I can close out that account once and for ever.

HOWEVER, it holds my first DOGE buy and is tracking my profit margins ever since. I am hesitant to let it go for this silly datapoint alone. Over 23 cents worth! However...

I bought in when it was three a penny. While I ended up with like 74 DOGE, I watched it grow in value from a quarter all the way up to like thirty bucks and back down to I dunno, like $6. I remember my ex-wife talking some smack about 'the ideas I was trying to teach my son' and pulling out my 36,000% profit, at an average monthly gain of 1000% over three years.

it felt sooo good that I haven't been able to get myself to just move out the DOGE. I truly *hate* that I have this account, and it has caused me faaaar more than $30 in time and trouble having to document that whole account for a handful of DOGE.

But those original charts.....

DogeDayDoesntExist,"Look at every single ""doge day"" in dogecoin's history. I used trading view and chose the ""dogeusd bitrex"" chart because it has the most historical data for doge out of all the charts I could find on trading view

4/20/2022 - doge dropped 1.16%
Within 3 weeks it dropped over 50%

4/20/2021- doge dropped 22.65% and dropped over 60% 3 days after

4/20/2020 - doge dropped 3.61% this time it actually increased in price after dropping for 2 days. Small drop. But still a red ""doge day"". It increased 37% over 10 days and proceeded to be stagnant for about 2 months with a decline I'm price over that time. 37% in growth in the week/days after dogeday, pales in comparison to the previous 50% and 60% drops we saw in the 2 years to follow this day.

4/20/2019
This time, doge had a green day on ""doge day"" it gained .05% in value and proceeded to drop over 15% in value 7 days later.

4/20/2018
Doge increased in price by 1.98%, so far this is the best price gains we've seen for doge on ""doge day"". From this day on, doge proceeded to drop around 60% before it found a low.

4/20/2017
Doge dropped just over 2%. This is probably the best ""dogeday"" in doge's history because after this day, doge totaled in increase of over 800% before finding its top. To be fair though, this was in the middle of the 2017 bull market. We are definitely not in the middle of the bull now. Perhaps the beginning, but we could very well still be in a bear market as well. Long story short. The day was was still red. And this day occurred in completely different market conditions. 

4/20/2016
Doge increased 1.36% and proceeded to pump about 7% more in the coming days. This may be the only iteration where ""dogeday"" could actually be argued as legitimate. However, this ""dogeday"" did not occur at the begging of its rally but at the end. Doge remained range bound for another month after topping out around the 26th.

4/20/2015
Doge increased  .6%. The months that followed provided volatility and stagnation. But ""dogeday"", yet again, was irrelevant.

That is all the dogedays I could find on tradingview.

With the data provided, ""dogeday"" had 4 green iterations and 4 red iterations.

Statistically this day is a big ol ""nothing burger""

Doge day doesn't exist. Don't get your hopes up. Keep in mind that dogecoin has been on an upward trend since March 11th of this year with a total increase of around 67-68% in gains in about a month's time. 

What's that old saying? Buy high, sell low? 

No. It's buy low and sell high.

I'll leave you with this question.

If dogecoin pumped over 65% in the last month, are you buying low?",7,11,2023-04-20 00:04:35,,dogecoin,,"[(""I do think there's a doge day, but it's not the same as a moon day.

Don’t give up: Here is why ?,"Not a Financial Advise.

This is my observation. Bitcoin is down roughly 8% from its previous high of 31000.
If BTC were to go back to previous high and Doge keeps up with BTC, we could see Doge going from 0.087 to 0.094.
Typically, Doge moves higher so I am guessing Doge would be 0.094-0.095 next time BTC reaches 31000.

Reality check on the price of dogecoin,"Let me be blunt:  The price of dogecoin has absolutely nothing to do with Elon's antics... Twitter, SpaceX, Tesla... completely irrelevant.

The only reason the ATH got as high as it did was because the news was reporting on it.  Elon's tweets may have bumped it a bit, but the main boost was all the news coverage of that event, which got us a lot of exposure.  Unless the headline were ""SpaceX to launch Starship funded by Dogecoin"", this launch had no chance.

The only reason we're seeing a slight increase right now is because there's a lot of people buying in the hopes that the launch would actually raise the price.

The only thing that will raise the price is the amount that gets purchased and the number of people who want to get in on it.  Buying the dip and hodling is the only way for the price to go up.  BUT when the price goes up, DON'T sell, because the more you sell, the more the market gets diluted, the faster the price drops again.

This is how pump and dumps work.  Someone (e.g. Elon) gets everyone else to buy, which pumps the price for a bit, then they dump all their coin, which make the price drop again.  They make a killing and the rest of us suffer.

This is not FUD, this is basic economics.

THAT ALL BEING SAID, I'm still hodling my 100K and will continue to do so, not because I expect to get rich, but because I believe in the coin and what it represents.  The very fact that it is so stable, speaks to the power of the coin and it's ability to be a currency.  People buying and selling and investing turn it into a commodity.  The only chance for us to go to the moon is for people to use it as a currency.  Buy and then use it to purchase goods and services.

Dogecoin’s Popularity Wanes As Rivals Emerge: What Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin has been facing struggles as other memecoins gain popularity, causing a significant reduction in its investor community. Despite experiencing a 20 percent spike in value year-to-date, the digital currency has dropped by approximately 5.39 percent this week, trading at around $0.084 on Friday.

Other coins such as $PEPE and $WOJAK have emerged and contributed to the decline in Dogecoin's popularity. However, Dogecoin still maintains its position as one of the most traded and liquid digital assets, with around 5.4 million holders, according to on-chain data.

The market for Dogecoin is still dominated by whale traders, who execute large transactions worth millions of dollars. In the past 24 hours alone, several transactions involving millions of dollars have been processed on the Dogecoin chain, demonstrating the continued influence of whale traders on the market.

According to analysts, traders can expect an altcoin season in the near future, with mapped-out levels for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  Despite the challenges, Dogecoin remains a popular cryptocurrency, and its performance in the market will continue to be monitored by investors and traders alike.",1,0,2023-04-21 10:42:40,,dogecoin,,"[('Dogecoin has something I\'ve never experienced with other cryptos; a deeper purpose.

My vision for an update on doge,"I think that in order for dogecoin to rise it’ll have to meet in the middle ground of the two communities the long term investors and average spenders of the coin. I suggest a soft cap that is minted each year, since an estimated 10,000 coins are minted each minute (5 billion) and will continue to rise with more miners making the value go down.

As if children were told about basic supply and demand equation in 5th grade, and that\'s all the economic education they received since. A total lack of macro economic theory exposure, and now they\'ve all grown up and fill the crypto subs like lemmings.\n\n""supply supply supply""\n\n![gif](giphy|VR26KGhBQFmnF3q6yJ)\n\nYou want to tinker with the new issuance rate. Not because it\'s the fundamentally correct thing to do.  But because it\'ll appease the masses/lemmings, and we\'ll see a large influx of new buyers, the price will shoot up in the short term, and people can unload their bags.

Exactly 10,000 coins per block, approximately every minute. Not one Doge more, not one less.\n\nAnd with every single block, the inflation rate decreases slightly. Currently somewhere in the 3-4% range, which is a pretty good place to be, and less than other top tier coins.\n\nAnd this is never going to change. Because the community is smarter than the average noob who comes in here and the first thing they post is ‘cap the coin!’. There is zero support for a cap, because people realise that killing mining would kill the coin. Literally make it completely worthless the moment that our hashpower dropped low enough for someone to carry out a 51% attack. After which there would be no Dogecoin.

That special photo of some long-lost friend, event, place, etc may have irreplaceable value to you. That doesn’t mean you’d get a huge price for it if you tried to sell it.\n\nPrices are set by one thing and one thing only. Trading activity. Every time a buyer and a seller agree to a transaction, that trade sets a new price. On the exchange they’re using. And if the exchange is one of the ones tracked by the aggregators, then it will contribute towards setting a new average price as well. Which is what your charts show.\n\nThat’s it. Nothing else makes any difference whatsoever. Not the supply. Not the moonshots and tweets and billboards and race cars and everything else people think up to try and jack up prices.\n\nSo why would someone want to pay more for a thing than the current price? Good question. Probably because they need it and they don’t care about the price. Like when my mum pays $100 for a pack of cigarettes, which I think is insane. Or maybe they think the price will go higher and they can make a profit. Or maybe they have some other reason, but you’d have to ask them.\n\nOne thing is certain though…\n\nNo one thinks ‘there are X number of coins being minted, so I’ll rush out and pay more for them’.

Relaunching free doge faucet (bagofdoge.com),"After reacquiring an old domain I had ([bagofdoge](https://bagofdoge.com/)), I decided to relaunch the faucet.

You can collect every 30 minutes, and get a random amount between 0.001 and 0.002 doge. When you reach 0.1 doge, the funds are automatically transferred to your wallet.

Let me know what you guys think, I can play with the time and amounts if you think it would make it more appealing.

Did you know this? Stop here and go do some research on this before you continue reading if you want. However do know that if you start digging, you gotta go pretty deep. Follow the green pharaoh. 👀 (not the white rabbit from the matrix, rabbit holes are bad mkay?)


It's part of the universal freedom that is to become, and unite mankind through mass utilization of only the strongest positive emotions. That's a lot right? Never forget that unlimited supply = unlimited demand. That's no different from what anyone has going on right now honestly. But just remember that it has been foretold in prophecy to be the most powerful currency to ever exist for us. Not for power over others; but power amongst ourselves!

So proud of you all! Keep on hodling.

PS: The quote was absolutely right. It really is just bitcoin with a doge face painted on it. Not only that, but it's one of the most powerful communities existing on what is called the world wide web. (Dont worry its not called that anymore. It's the internet remember? 😉)

The only ways to prevent this is:  \nA. fiat currency starts to deflate (something that hasn't happened in for significant periods of time in America since the 1930s)  \nB. people stop using doge as a means of exchanging value. This can only happen if we give up on it. If we let bad actors taint the message to their own ends. Promote good and keep fighting for usage.  \n\n\nRight now the math says doge=1$ around 2029-2030 though multiple factors can effect that.  \n\n\nThat said that's an increase of 1150% in 7 years. Since the investment market average is to shoot 8-12% I'd say its a good investment."", 2), ('Short answer: Maybe\n\nLonger answer: Possibly', 8), ('Thank you so much for explaining and giving hope 🤗', 0), ('I hope it goes up soon', 0), ('[removed]', 0), ('They are literally telling you the opposite of the facts lol.\n\nPrinting new coins is inflationary, doge is inflationary...\n\nThey are also telling you fiat tends to deflate.... when is the last time you heard of the dollar deflating?\n\nThey are either messing with you, or they only have 2 operating brain cells.', 2), ('Deflationary in that it has a set creation amount.

There is no implemented hard cap on the total supply of Dogecoins. Nonetheless, in February 2014, Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer announced that the limit would be removed in an effort to create a consistent reduction of its inflation rate over time.[60] In other words, the inflation rate improves over time starting at 5% in 2015 to less than 4% by 2019, 3% by 2027, and 2% by 2035.', -1), (""which in tern causes a deflationary effect when compared to the standard inflation rate  goal set by the fed comparing to the $  \n\n\nIf doge inflation is 2% over a year, and the $'s inflation is 5% over a year then the effective difference is a deflation of 3%"", 1), ('Yes', 3), ('Lol you are hopeless.

Recycling my aluminum and matching it $1 for $1 into doge,So Doge is hands down my favorite meme coin! But I wasn’t sure what type of investment I wanted to make into it until a few years ago I found a place that would pay me for my aluminum cans. I remember leaving my parents house with a few bags of my aluminum cans and I was the only one not throwing them into the trash at the time. I came home with like $30 and decided to match it $1 for $1 and put that money into Doge since recycling helps make our planet a little better so I was helping my side of Do Only Good Everyday! Best part is when my parents saw how much I got for my aluminum basically everyone on my family started keeping their aluminum cans for me! Might not be rich but I love how something simple of taking care of our planet actually allowed me to invest into something.

"Dogecoin , pure motives and a lot of heart","It’s the bottom of the ninth, score tied, two out. Out of the dugout comes an unassuming coin who doesn’t strut, simply walks to the plate with purpose and determination. After a few practice swings, steps into the box and prepares for the first pitch. All this time there is only one thought on Doge’s mind, do it for the people, they deserve to be treated fairly, have equality in the financial system. The pitcher winds up, throws the ball and on the first pitch Dogecoin hits it out of the ballpark, winning the game.

The moral of this story is that if one has true motives, a strong safe platform, the backing of populations and a lot of luck, the little guy can win!!!

And swapping blocks between nodes? Meh. Again, once synced, it takes bugger all to keep that going.\n\nNow, by all means burn all the resources you want to keep something running if you want.

Needless to say, I’m never going to be able to pull that stunt with that particular teller again, since she made it clear she’ll be checking them all herself now that she knows.\n\nOh, and for those who don’t know about test notes, here’s what’s going on…\n\nAfter Australia introduced the first polymer bank notes back in 1988, it was soon discovered that they weren’t exactly robust enough for general circulation. So processes were changed to improve them.\n\nOne of the changes was to try a different undercoat. You can’t print on plastic, so you need to put the base coat down to enable that. And they needed a way to tell the difference, and to have the automatic sorters pull the test notes out for examination.\n\nAussie Banknotes use a 4-character prefix followed by the serial number. The prefix denominates the position on the sheet and the year. But they don’t use the whole alphabet. So the first prefix is AA96 for 1996, but they only go to AM96 with the next one being BA96 and so on. The last prefix for the normal notes was JK96.\n\nSo the test notes were given prefixes from AN to AZ, etc. The actual prefixes issued were AN96 to CS96. But then they discovered a problem with this plan.\n\nUnlike the smaller denominations, $100’s don’t really circulate. They sit in bank vaults and safes for many years, and therefore they were unable to gather the test results they were after. So the following year, they printed 9,771 sheets of $5 notes in the range AN97 to DN97. These changed hands far more often, and wore out in about six months, making them very rare and valuable now.\n\nThe $100s are relatively easier to find in good condition, even all these years later.\n\nAnd if you’ve read this far, you now know far more than you ever expected to learn here. 😎', 3), ('So, I’ve read the whole thread, but I still don’t get the logic behind this excercise.\n\nWhy would you burn two sets of fees and go to all this trouble when you could simply send 100 Doge from one wallet to another?

There are those who simply buy and hold, and there are those who actively trade. Initially, when I started this adventure, I was not the latter. I lacked knowledge and was still in the process of learning.\n\nOne thing that has become clear to me is that many of us in the cryptoverse use the phrase ""to the moon"" to describe reaching a certain price target, without necessarily considering the real-life benefits of the underlying technology. However, there are others who are genuinely interested in the potential utility of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I realize that this might sound naïve, but similar skepticism was expressed about the internet in its early days.\n\nThe most important thing is to be willing to risk only what you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin has reached over $1T before (currently at $530M), and that number was reached without any crypto truly moving beyond early adoption. At $8/doge, we would have eclipsed the $1T market cap. This seems more plausible. If any of the following things occur, $20T is possible:\n\n* A market place is developed where regular goods and services are bought and sold regularly using dogecoin. $20/coin would mean a market cap of $2.8T, nearly 3x Bitcoin at its peak. It seems highly unlikely to reach this amount of capital if dogecoin is simply ""an investment"". But, if it graduates to a productively used currency for goods, that is game-changer.\n* The dollar loses its world reserve currency status and governments use a full basket of currencies, including multiple cryptocurrencies, as a replacement. Unfortunately, this is not impossible. But, without an intermediate layer handling thousands of transactions per second, dogecoin would likely only have a small % of a basket. Also, the likelihood is offset by the reality that governments want to push their own CBDCs, or BRICs alternatives. \n* Cumulative impacts of inflation over time, plus adoption pushes market cap up 200x. This seems the most unlikely scenario to get us there as it would probably take decades, if ever.  \nI don\'t expect to see $20/doge in my lifetime, but I do think $8/doge is possible.

I like Fulvio's overall paper wallet approach, I've used it in the past.  Time to revisit.  But I'll use an air-gapped linux instance with dogecoin-core to generate private keys and addresses, to be saved to an encrypted thumb drive. I'll keep a thumb drive setup for running a node when I need it. I'll sync it once a quarter so it won't be that far behind at any given moment, and sync of course when I need to use it.

But that has it's own issues of course. People just need to do some thinking and figure out what's best for them.  There's no perfect recipe.

Hence bankruptcies, and with countless entities forming a chain of ""owing each other"", and with enough of them not ever going to pay the other back, it becomes viral.

Very quickly your financial balance sheet is horribly negative.

Clarifying my previous post about Dogecoin and New York,"in 2014 I bought about $500usd in Dogecoin and have it stored safely in a paper wallet.  I love dogecoin and am 99% a HODL'er. 

For the last couple years I have decided to use some of the dogecoin to buy gold and silver coins - just to spread what I have and to get some precious metals. Using JM Bullion, I made several purchases using Bitpay and everything was fine but then NYS decided to 'protect' me by banning dogecoin (crypto) transactions with these services.  I know I can use the doge one on one but what companies allow purchases for precious metals while living in this WONDERFUL state of new york?  What are my options to buy precious metals?  I only want to use my doge to purchase silver and gold.   


Someone mentioned bitrefill - I guess that might be an option

What are doginals? How DRC-20 is changing the cryptocurrency landscape.,"Hello everyone, I'm doog and I run The Bone. I know many of us are still in the dark as to what doginals and DRC-20 really is, so I thought I would make a short post on where this stuff came from.

https://preview.redd.it/r6r6vacb3o3b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c4e7b61ddd3ca549ed080bb853a6fc5d7d8c35

# What are doginals? An introduction to DRC-20.

Doginals - a word you may have heard recently, but what are they really? Where did they come from and *why* did they come about? I'm here to help break that down, but first, to understand Doginals, we first need to take a short look at their cousin, Ordinals.

Ordinals have become a popular trend in the Bitcoin community as of late. Similar to NFTs, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets inscribed onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. This became possible through Casey Rodarmor’s “Ordinal Theory”, which created a system for individualizing satoshis and giving them unique identities.

Similar to how Ordinals inscribe information onto the smallest units of a Bitcoin, Doginals inscribe information onto the smallest units of Dogecoin, named *shibes*.

You see, each shibe can store a very tiny amount of information via a process we call “inscribing”. By keeping track every shibe in circulation, a normally fungible token like $DOGE can be inscribed with data, tracked, and transferred amongst collectors, speculators, and enthusiasts.

## How the heck is any of this done?

By using a tool called an indexer, which is just a fancy word for a platform that acts as a ledger for all of the data being written onto every single shibe in existence. Armed with an indexer, users can now create token and image collections on blockchains that wouldn’t normally have the capacity to natively map this type of information.

Plain and simple: Doginals came about as a spin on Bitcoin’s Ordinals. Because Dogecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, they both have the capability to utilize Ordinal Theory. Amongst the hype of Bitcoin’s Ordinals spawned a handful of other mirrored systems, including Doginals on Dogecoin and Litecoin Ordinals on, uh, Litecoin.

## So how did Doginals specifically come about?

In February 2023, a developer named ""Apezord"" introduced the Doginal standard by launching the first Shibescription (shown below).  


[Shibescription 0](https://preview.redd.it/hl3gd7jp3o3b1.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e753ce2eaf25e92cbdd9ea415c19366e584ea090)

This sparked the formation of a community where numerous Shibescriptions were created, ranging from texts to images to even gifs. During this time, someone also introduced the inaugural DRC-20 token, $DOGI, with a maximum supply of 21 million “tokens”.

Progress in the DRC-20 space has faced its fair share of obstacles, mainly due to the challenges posed by Dogecoin's random block rewards (that’s a topic for another day). Projects have thus far faced difficulties in establishing a reliable indexing infrastructure which means sometimes your collection would be recognized as one thing in one place, and entirely different attributes in another.

But, despite this, leaps are being made within the doginals community, and DRC-20 trading has been off the charts.

On May 22nd, transactions on $DOGE skyrocketed, marking a new all time high of over 719,000. For reference, Bitcoin’s transactions for the day - in the midst of Ordinals season still, mind you - was 566,000.

Similar to Bitcoin’s Ordinals, Doginals began to rapidly gain interest from the wider cryptocurrency community. The low fee structure of Dogecoin allowed many participants to begin minting all sorts of DRC-20s without too much overhead or risk.

Plus, you know, being early to the next new thing in crypto never *hurt*.

## Not Everything that glitters is gold.

Doginals have not been without their challenges, however - and there’s been contention both inside and outside of the community when it comes to DRC-20.

For example, one Dogecoin core developer [*voiced*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RlY3J5cHQuY28vMTQwNDY4L2RvZ2Vjb2luLWFjdGl2aXR5LXN1cmdlcy13aXRoLW9yZGluYWxzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dGhlYm9uZS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj13aGF0LWFyZS1kb2dpbmFscyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI2Y2JjNGExMy00N2EwLTRjODQtOGY3Ny0yYzkwZjBkNDJlZWMiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImQ4NTg3MWZhLTlmOTEtNDhmZC1iM2Y3LTBiMjA1OGFkMWNiYyIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiM2ZkZDBiODctYmJiNS00YWQ3LTlmY2YtYjU1ODJiNjU3ZTNhIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg1NzMyOTEzLjIxOSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.HJTTwPf11u8QltVVVMPT8cQxvR9-4dogxdIFnQ9Uzwg) his skepticism, saying:

*“Something like this cannot become a real ‘feature’ because it has not had enough thought given to it… Sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly.”* \-Patrick Lodder

Coincidentally enough, a similar sentiment was shared by Luke Dashjr, one of the leading Bitcoin Core developers, in relation to BRC-20. He went so far as to say that immediate action needed to be taken to stop the Ordinals trend.

If you’ve attempted to transact with Bitcoin recently, you may have noticed the elaborately high fees. In case you need a quick refresher, as competition for block space increases, so does the cost to transact on the network.

Case-in-point: Dogecoin network’s transaction fees increased three-fold between May 10th and May 22nd. Thankfully, the fees are still relatively cheap due to the nature of Dogecoin’s blockchain, but you get the picture.

## What’s Next?

That’s the million dollar question now isn’t it? I’m afraid the only answer I can confidently say is: Who knows?

Ordinals are still new enough that we’re seeing exorbitant volume on Bitcoin’s blockchain, so we don’t even have much to compare the current state of affairs to.

Maybe doginals will fade away into the annuls of crypto history. Or maybe, just maybe, DRC-20 is the next evolution of $DOGE history. But, for a chain built on community, memes, and having fun, some might say doginals is just what the shibe ordered.",5,15,2023-06-02 20:52:46,,dogecoin,Educational,"[('WARNING. NEW ACCOUNT DETECTED.

Through this practice, the SEC alleges that Zhao was able to inflate the Binance.US trading volume.\n\nWhat does Binance say?\nBinance says that it has actively cooperated with the SEC since the start of its investigation and and “respectfully disagrees” with the allegations.\n\n“We intend to defend our platform vigorously,” the company said in a blogpost, but added that “because Binance is not a US exchange, the SEC’s actions are limited in reach”.\n\n\n^^^ interesting 🤔', 5), ('It is interesting 🙂 I think shibes should welcome the news because we want to see organic movement, not manipulation by whales.', 3), ('[removed]', 0), ('I don’t think it’s Binance I think it’s more powerful and sinister entities and Binance is in their way - FTX was never held accountable and their collapse did nothing to help us.

crypto rules:

1. hodl
2. buy the dip (best before whales)
3. never sell at a loss
4. don't do leverage trading / options / derivates
5. don't do margin trading
6. don't stake crypto that is not meant to be staked
7. don't lend crypto to exchanges (or anybody)
8. best case store it in a cold wallet
9. only invest what you can afford to loose (or hodl long time)
10. ignore FUD - do your own research on your investment

There are \\~30,000 different cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, etc.  Just a few years ago less than a 100.\n\nI think DEFI/CEFI will survive, but undergo a massive cleansing. Till then my opinion of DEFI/CEFI in general is negative. I think today there's 30,000 cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, and in the near future, most will be zombies or dead.\n\nThe entire point of crypto was to return a modicum of power to the people. I think the only ones that authentically pursue that in technical terms, as well as social structural terms, are Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.  With the exception of Ethereum, I think most DEFI/CEFI fails miserably at giving some power back to the people.\n\nI also believe, that most DEFI is fake.

The likes of FTX ,BlockFI, Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows, UST, Terra/Luna, Safemoon, and hundreds, maybe thousands of DEFI/CEFI hacks and thefts.

A true asset, and unofficial digital currency.\n\nOf course people need to realize that global factors, and their own personal timing/luck, as well as there being no guarantees, plays a big part in the success or failure, of one's investments.\n\nDon't rely on a time frame for gains, because that's how you get roasted.  Never invest what you can't afford to ignore for years and years.  I expect dogecoin to continue succeeding, but I know that it may not.

Why $1 is possible and probable,"The purpose of this post is to post relationships of doge relative to if countries, businesses, people provided below. This is intended for these wild what if scenarios purely to value if statements 

The global “value” of currency is $83,000,000,000,000 (83 trillion dollars) in the world wide. There is only 139,742,006,383.71 DOGE (139 billion)

On May 8, 2021, Dogecoin briefly reached its highest market capitalization of $88.8 Billion with a price of $0.6818 per Dogecoin. 

Let’s assume these far off scenarios take place at the same day and time to make math simpler. Or in other words maintaining the same circulating supply. 

88,800,000,000 = $.6818 
For similar math let’s us 88.8 trillion as world currency 
88,800,000,000,000 = $681.8 per doge 

If 10% of worlds supply is invested/utilizing doge for its cheap transactions 

8,800,000,000,000 = $68.18 per doge

The us has $2,344,000,000,000 dollars (🤷🏽‍♂️) (2.34 trillion) 
 
This is roughly 1 doge being equivalent to $18.16 usd 

If 10% of the USD was invested in doge it would be $1.816

China has 10.47 trillion yuan in circulation at the end of 2022. That’s 1,465,237,342,200 usd. If all Yuan was doge. 1 Doge would be 11.35 usd. 10% is 1.35. 

If 10 percent of us and china invested in doge. $1 doge would be $3.16 usd. 

Tesla is $789 billion dollars. 789,000,000,000 almost 10x doge at its peak. Almost $6.81

Amazons 978 billion. As of June 2023 Apple has a market cap of $2.890 Trillion.

XMR is truly designed to be as close to a P2P electronic cash system, just with the word privacy added, and the scalability is there.', 0), (""I like XMR, but the world is not ready for privacy coins.\n\nToo many people and governments are still scared of crypto. XMR will have its day, but that's not today."", 1), ('Honestly XMR is what the world needs. It’s quite like cash. Cash is great because you can have it physically, it’s inherently private, and it can’t be taken away without force. Your cash cannot be frozen, it can’t disappear like 0’s on your bank account. You don’t have to rely on some institution to hold your federal dollars when you have cash, it’s in your hands. 0 FDIC insurance. Crypto checks many of those boxes in general as well. I think where Monero really shines does happen to be the privacy features. Bitcoin had anonymity built in mind, but it was more pseudonymous. Many people assume their identity is safe with bitcoin, but you’re really just a pile of numbers and letters linked to a log of transactions. With Monero, your identity is guaranteed to be safe, your transaction history isn’t public, and other people can’t link a to b. They mix wallet addresses and who sent what, and how much was sent, etc. There’s proof it happened though. I mean it’s quite literally proof-of -work..except it’s just the proof that the work happened lol, and me and you can’t see the work.  It’s not who sent what, how much of it, who has how many. Just proof of a transaction sent between two parties, and only a set of cryptographic mathematics processed by the nodes and of course the two parties independently can confirm the rest of what happened. \n\nIf you pay someone with a 20 that has serial number 001. The authorities can not look at that and say “Hey, Bob bought a knife from Steve with this 20. Then Steve bought some Ice cream and had a good day with it.” They just see it’s a $20 bill. They can go ask Bob or Steve what happened to it, but the transaction is only between Bob and Steve. Only they can truly confirm if it ever happened, why it was used, etc. With bitcoin, and other chains, it isn’t like that. Authorities could say, “Why was one bitcoin sent to Bob, which was from Steve? Steve is a drug dealer. We linked your wallet an exchange you use where we suspect you…” My point is, a P2P electronic cash system would inherently be as private as Monero is, Satoshi just didn’t have that same implementation. Monero is also super cool due to it only being CPU mineable. This makes it a very decentralized currency due to its nature. Don’t want to compete with ASICs? Buy CPUs. If you look at it, you can get a beast of a Monero mining setup for the price of one ASIC miner. It will always be like that too! RandomX is designed to literally only be CPU mineable, you can’t use ASICs or GPUs. XMR for daily transactions, ETH for expansion of web3, DOGE for DOGE. Doge is super cool, I’d also really love to direct you to Monero. Sorry for the redditor essay. XMR + DOGE, to the moon🚀🚀', 1), ('Like I said. Monero is great, but it\'s too early to assume that governments will adopt it. \n\nBut on a side note, an ASIC is an ""application specific integrated circuit"", while a CPU is a general integrated circuit. Any ASIC optimized for a specific task will always outperform a GPU. There just don\'t seem to be any that are specialized on Monero yet.\n\nMeanwhile, when the price of an ASIC already buys you a beefy mining rig, any company that would be able to afford hundreds of ASICs can also afford hundreds of CPUs.', 2), ('Appreciate your response. One massive thing, I don’t think we need governments to adopt crypto…isn’t that the point? I never have assumed their approval to be necessary. Yes, keeping crypto in good standings and the government taking a stance is important to the crypto world but the point of crypto is that we don’t need any centralized entities approval. I can send to you and you can send to me. Your keys, your crypto. If anything, DOGE and XMR are both equally far away from government adoption.\n\nAs far as ASICs go, I’m very aware of what ASICs and CPUs are. The reason I bring up ASICS is because the RandomX algorithm is heavily resistant to optimization through ASICs. Even if a company can buy a bunch of CPUs, so what? The entry to mining is still so low that it keeps Monero pretty decentralized. The problem with mining Bitcoin is the startup and running costs. I think coins that have a public ledger are important and cool, but I also think having a currency closer to cash transactions like Monero is super necessary. I think buying doge is the most necessary.', 1), ('If you want to move money from your bank account to an exchange, so you can buy crypto, you need government approval.\n\nIf the government says no, the bank says no and worst case, they close your account just for trying to buy crypto.\n\nCrypto does not need government support to run, but you need government support to participate. \n\nI like Monero.

Becoming a Doge millionaire and then going bankrupt," I'm not sure if anyone remembers me, but I was the guy who became a millionaire overnight thanks to Doge. I bought a few thousand Doge coins back in 2013 very little, and then forgot about them. A few years later, Doge went viral and the value of my coins skyrocketed. I was suddenly a millionaire!

I was living in a small apartment at the time, working a dead-end job. I had always dreamed of being rich, but I never thought it would actually happen to me. I was so excited! I quit my job and started planning my new life. I bought a big house, a fancy car, and started traveling the world. I was living the dream!  


But then, the price of Doge started to fall. I didn't think much of it at first. I figured it was just a temporary dip. But the price kept falling, and falling, and falling. Soon, I was losing money every day. I started to panic. I sold some of my coins, but it was too late. I had lost most of my money.

I was devastated. I had gone from being a millionaire to being broke in a matter of months. I had to move back into my old apartment and get a new job. I was humiliated. I felt like a failure.

It took me a long time to recover from my losses. I had to learn to live with the fact that I had made a huge mistake. I also had to learn to be more responsible with my money. I'm still not where I want to be financially, but I'm slowly getting back on my feet.

I'm sharing my story because I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. If you're thinking about investing in Doge, or any other cryptocurrency, please be careful. Don't invest more money than you can afford to lose. And don't get too greedy. If you're up big, take some profits and lock in your gains. Don't wait for the price to go even higher, because it might not.

I'm still trying to recover from my losses, but I'm determined to come back stronger than ever. I'm not going to let this experience define me. I'm going to learn from my mistakes and move on. I know that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I just need to keep working hard and never give up.",1,0,2023-06-13 16:14:35,,dogecoin,,"[(""TLDR: don't trade on emotions and realize your loss because you get scared.\n\nWhen you are confident enough with your investment that you can forget about it before it explodes, you should be confident enough with it, when it starts to dip.\n\nPeople trading with emotions are the reason why retail investors rarely win big.

Welllllp D.O.G.E. it's official:,"The fud slingers have cometh.

I remember many a fudster showing up on this sub about the time doge blew up before.

Does anyone else get the feeling that the fud orchestra is a paid service?  

Now this is just speculation, but I feel like some individuals that control a large portion of a currency often use their wealth to pay less fortunate individuals to carry out the dirty work. It also feels to me that many individuals don't care about ethics or principles unless it suits them and will often try to use your emotions and values to make you act/feel/think a specific way about somthing to distract you from the actual picture and  further their agenda. 

I don't and have never claimed to know much about monies or stocks. BUT I sure know what spear phishing scheme looks like (it happens alot and it's ridiculously sad).  

Protect your minds Fam! Make your own choices,  always seek more information than what is being force fed to you.

I have heard: Be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearfull when others are greedy. 

But I would like to say: ""Be kind when others are lost, and stand firm in love.""",1,0,2023-06-13 22:42:02,,dogecoin,Opinion piece,[]

In one week...,"I will start the award distribution for posts that uphold and spread the values of hodling the doge mindset. Doge says it loves each and every one of you that are spreading positivity and uplifting others, and wants to show support for positive things that people say regarding its true nature.

Much like doge, a simple award can make a world of difference to someone. Like a cop trying his best to serve his community, whom is having a rough day, who's spirits become lifted with a simple ""Thank you for everything you do for us."" As a result he now has happy thoughts and works in a state of pure positivity for the rest of his shift, benefiting every single person he interacts with for the means of the greater good.

Don't clown on this fellow Shibes. The importance of mindset is much greater than most would like to realize. Change your mindset, change the world. Awards will help those whom get them in a simple way that can be cultivated into something much greater than an award. Those that need such a thing will be the ones whom recieve them. I have no control over this other than the fact that I will be distributing them. The idea of who is bound to recieve them definitely won't come from me.

We have no control over the ideas we have.
Remember that.
Trust the ideas that spawn from a Doge mindset are what will change this world towards a path of greater good.

Doge isn't about money.
It's about a solution to the problem THAT IS money.

That\'s what is called respect for your peers. I am now rethinking the notion of whether you telling me to post it or not over it being ""americentric"" was actually the proper call. I might just revise the entire statement and post it anyways after this comment you have made. \n\nYou upset me.\n\nWhy are you attempting to combat me when you were one of the very first people whom I contacted on reddit about my purpose and what needs to be done. Flabergastation is a proper word to be used in this context in regards to the emotion I am experiencing as a human being.\n\nOut of pure respect, I\'ll answer your questions.\n\nWhat I write and how I uphold myself should tell you exactly what I\'m about without need for question. \n\nAwards. As In the awards that reddit allows to be made on posts if you are able to do so given you have the reddit coins necessary. Some posts will receive large awards, and some will be smaller. They are awarded none the less. Why would this be questioned by you being an outstanding member of the reddit community?\n\nFor what? I mentioned this already, but I will reiterate once again out of respect. Posts that uphold what the doge mindset really means and is truly about. Doing only good everyday. Your need to even question this shows me what your actual outlook on life might be, and let me be the first and hopefully the last to tell you that your outlook isn\'t exactly positive in this aspect. If you change your mindset you really do change every aspect of the world around you that is encountered, and bad days that come for the sole means of testing your will can now benefit the strength of your fortitude and the resolve you attribute to such a mindset.\n\nNo. Doge is not money. Just because money buys doge, it doesn\'t mean that the same is said for dogecoin. I can\'t walk into whatever store or shop that I please, whip out a dogecoin card, and pay for it in actual dogecoin. Any program currently existing to do such a thing transmits payment in the form of doge being transfered into a fiat currency for said payment. It\'s a flawed system.\n\nDo you have any more questions, Fulvio?', 1), ('I’m sorry I upset you. That was not my intent at all.\n\nAnd two things you need to understand about me.\n\n1.

I wasn’t questioning that. Rather, I was pointing out that what you wrote was not specific enough and needed further explanation. And still does.\n\nAs for money, you are correct that using Doge universally does require conversion. However there are some people willing to accept Doge directly. What they do with it once they receive it is entirely up to them. Some cash it out immediately because they have costs to cover in fiat. Others hold it for some period of time. In my own case, the Banknotes that I sold back in 2016, the coins went into a wallet that has never been touched since. Each to their own, y’know?\n\nIn an ideal world, we would have a circular economy. Then people could use the coins from their sales to pay their suppliers, who could pay their suppliers, and the coins would go round and round just like fiat does. But we are not there yet, and likely never will be as long as this ‘to the Moon’ mindset and volatility prevail. Flawed, yes, fixable, probably not.\n\nAgain, apologies for upsetting you.', 1)]"

Nearly a decade of dogecoin and why I'm still (mostly) hodling,"9 years ago someone from some sketchy forum sold me 20k dogecoin for $10 via paypal - Today those 20k dogecoins are worth around $1200usd. I have accumulated enough doge that I feel that I am comfortable with the amount and am already happy with the amount they are worth today in USD.   It took years of believing, forgetting, learning, questioning and deciding that I'm going to mostly be a HODLer.  

For YEARS my doge was worth like $.0025 and I remember I almost cashed the entire amount out for $900usd. but thankfully got lazy and forgot about it.....then one day.....bam.  It's worth a PENNY! We are now 6x that amount and people are complaining…..I get it - you bought when it was higher but just HODL - it will work out soon

I have cashed out enough to furnish my entire podcasting setup - new mics, rodecaster pro 2, Mac, monitors, etc etc.  - I also used a bit in the days of $.40 to buy a 1972 VW Beetle. 

Without Dogecoin I wouldn’t have made these purchases as easily. My friends ask me why I don't just 'cash out' and the only answer I can give is, I believe dogecoin will make me rich, I mean, It already made the best profit I have ever made and dogecoin has never let me down.

Need Help With Old Wallets Multidoge,"I remember back in 2014 I used Guiminer and mined some dogecoin in some sort of pool. This reflects In my multidoge log file, I’m not entirely sure whether or not I got any doge added to my account from this pool, and I have no idea what to take away from the log to try and figure it out. 

Ik this is vague as hell but if someone could help look through my logs and whatnot and perhaps help I’ll compensate if any doge is found. I checked the wallets that were connected to the pool and they had no transactions so I’m not sure if i just didn’t get paid for the mining or what lol",9,2,2023-06-19 20:00:07,,dogecoin,,"[('I believe it was rapidhash', 1), ('First up, using ‘lite’ clients for high transaction purposes like faucets or mining was a very, very bad idea. Because those clients choke on anything more than 50 UTXOs. The coins would become basically unspendable and a nightmare to fix.\n\nSecondly, all pools had/have a payout threshold. Which you could set within limits. They also encourage you to not leave coins in their wallets. If you had a high threshold and didn’t reach it, there is a pretty good chance the coins are gone depending on what happened to the pool.\n\nBe aware that Doge mining is dead. Since AuxPoW, all our mining is done by Litecoin pools, and they mostly pay out in LTC. When we switched, all the doge pools died, and their wallets died with them.\n\nSo, what I would do is this…\n\nStart with your MD client. You should be able to export your keys, but make sure you do it in plain text, not the default encrypted file. Once you’ve done that, you have text wallets. Which as I’ve been preaching for nine years now, is the only truly secure offline cold storage. Search for ‘text wallet’ and have a read.\n\nThen look up your wallets on bitinfocharts. Whatever it says they contain is what you’ve got. Take note of any outgoing transactions, and also the UTXO counts. Scripts such as coinb.in (which you should download and run locally offline, because you never want to expose your keys to the internet) also have limits, generally 100 UTXOs. If you have wallets with more than this (one guy had 36,000 UTXOs in MD back in the day!), you need to consolidate coins in batches. Since coinb.in will happily let you send coins back into the source wallet, this isn’t hugely onerous, but can be tedious. And comparatively expensive, even with the current low fees.\n\nHope this helps, and sorry for any losses you may have suffered.', 1)]"

Light version of Dogecoin wallet is not supported any more?,"Hi all,

I just realised Dogecoin does not support a light version wallet like MultiDoge any more?

So this moment the only offical wallet is the Dogecoin Core?

Anybody knows?

Many thanks!",2,3,2023-04-18 06:03:21,,dogecoin,,"[('These are not wallets. They are software clients. Because wallets are not software, they’re numbers, that’s all. And you don’t need software to have a number, do you?\n\nTo be clear, you do not need a client at all to have as many thousands of wallets as your little heart desires. Just go to walletgenerator.net and run off a big heap in the bulk tab, then let them ‘mellow’ for as long as possible before use, because anything exposed to the internet can be compromised. Therefore, letting enough time pass that bad guys will stop checking wallets is always a good idea.\n\nOr, you can go to https://privatekeys.pw/keys/dogecoin/405367151004111983960333312545766754610509000105382894697474272261018047099 and grab a few wallets, after hitting the random button a few times of course. Again, let them age.\n\nOr, you could fire up Core, let it build its files, then use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with a hundred wallets in it. At which point you can delete the client, as you don’t need it.\n\nAnd, since you do need a way to spend coins, and since coinb.in supports Doge and importantly can be downloaded and run offline, you could use it to generate single wallets as well.\n\nHowever you get your wallets, never ever expose them to the internet. Keep them offline on multiple removable media stored in safe places where they won’t all get destroyed by fire, flood, etc.\n\nNow, as to why old clients aren’t available anymore? It’s pretty simple really. Most of these things are one-man shows, and people are notorious for losing interest and abandoning projects. I should know, I wrote a book about coins (the real world metal things) that I haven’t bothered updating since 2016. One day, maybe…\n\nAlso, so-called ‘lite’ wallets come with a bunch of gotchas that have led to many people losing their coins. For starters, file formats are unique and incompatible between them. And they have severe UTXO limits which can cause crashes and make coins unspendable. And while they don’t require the full blockchain, they do require access to the internet so they can download relevant necessary blocks.\n\nContrast this with a simple script like coinb.in, which loads UTXOs on the fly from your choice of networks, and which can operate entirely offline except for the loading and eventual broadcast of the signed transaction. Plus, because the keys are always readable, you’re never going to get locked out by software issues.\n\nThat cover it for you?', 3), (""Thanks!\n\nIt's so technical that I don't understand most of it but appreciate your help!\n\nAnyway, you are telling me that this light version does not exist anymore if I'm not wrong!"", 2), ('I’m not saying that lite clients don’t exist. I am saying they are unnecessary and definitely not recommended.\n\nAs for being technical, no, not at all. It’s actually really, really simple, but it does take a little effort to get your head around it.\n\nThis is all explained in the ELI5s, but the key parts are these…\n\nA wallet is a 256-bit number, basically. They all exist, have always existed, and will always exist.\n\nBecause the numbers are so big, it’s almost impossible to randomly pick one that’s already been used. This is the core of the security of crypto. You cannot reverse engineer a key, and you can’t guess it. Therefore, you better not lose it, ever, cos you can’t get it back.\n\nCoins don’t live in wallets. They live on the blockchain, in UTXOs tagged with the address of the owning wallet.\n\nMoving coins is simply a matter of writing an instruction to move them from where they are to new UTXOs belonging to the receiving wallets you choose. You sign these instructions with your secret private key, and then you broadcast the signed transaction to the network of nodes. And in a minute or two, miners will add it to the blockchain.\n\nIf you understand that, you’ve got pretty much everything you need. The rest you will pick up over time, but it’s not critical.', 1)]"

Raising money to fix a bike.,"Henlo Shibas. 

I would like to raise money to fix a kids bicycle.

He took it apart hoping to fix it ( He is12 years old) but it turned out He can´t and broke the parts ( Shift,brakes and even the chain). I promised to the family I try to fix it ( I thought it´s an easy assembling job but I didn´t know the parts are literally broken). 

I wrote a list for them what I need to repair on the bike ( cost 100-150 €) but They said it´s too much money but they wouldn´t accept my money but I know the bike is very important for the boy,

So ladies and gentleman I found my old PHYSICAL DOGECOIN and I would like to sell it just for as much as it gonna cover the repair cost. 

So if someone would donate or buy the coin from me please let me know.

Of course I´m gonna send the receipt from the parts and pictures how the repair goes.

Maybe it´s a silly idea but that´s all I can do.

Thank YOU for the attention.

Perspective from the outside,"Although the intrinsic value of Dogecoin is strong, unfortunately, public perception of the cryptocurrency is quite poor. Ongoing volatility within the crypto market only reinforces this negative perception, causing potential investors to shy away and ultimately diminish the overall intrinsic value of Dogecoin.

However, if you have faith in the asset, invest and hold onto it for 5+ years. The reality is that Dogecoin is poised to skyrocket, and by investing now and holding onto it, you stand to earn far more than by attempting to time the market with every dip.

It's important to note that reducing volatility is crucial to improving public perception and gaining widespread adoption of Dogecoin. The faster this happens, the quicker the public will gain respect for the asset and embrace it.",1,0,2023-04-24 21:15:24,,dogecoin,,[]

How did they steal all my Dogecoin and what can I do about it?,"About three years ago, I bought a lot of dogecoin on Binance. 

Then, to make it safer, I followed the instructions on this page to get in into a paper wallet: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin\_paper\_wallet\_tutorial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin_paper_wallet_tutorial/)

I disconnected my computer from the internet, generated several paper wallets from walletgenerator, and then sent the coins to a wallet. I printed off the paper wallets, and have never saved the wallets to my computer or showed them to a friend or anything. 

I never did anything with the Dogecoin. Never linked it to any sort of online account or app. Never entered the wallet information into any sort of website. Never sent any Dogecoin from it, or did I ever put any more into it. I just left it alone.

Today, I decided to see how it's doing, only to discover that back in November, someone stole all the dogecoin out of the wallet. It is empty. Gone.

Needless to say, I'm freaking out. Is there anything I can do?

They probably secretly kept track of every wallet address they generated and someone went rogue and stole coins.\n\n u/Fulvio55 pushes for text wallets all the time, maybe he has more to add with what went wrong.', 1), ('Search here for ‘text wallet’ and have a read. Not sketchy at all.', 2), ('OK, so without looking at your actual wallet(s) and doing some forensics, here’s a generic answer…\n\nWallets, as you may know, are nothing but numbers. As in the private keys. And all numbers already exist, have always existed and cannot be created nor destroyed.\n\nBut, you can know or not know a number. Therefore the important thing is for you to never either lose or reveal your keys to anyone.\n\nNow, as to walletgenerator, there have been a couple of security issues over the years, which allowed someone else to gain access to keys.\n\nThe first was a clone site which phoned home with every key it generated. That was discovered, people were warned by the people behind the legitimate site, and it was eventually taken down.\n\nThe second was a change in the code that basically allowed keys to be reissued, so they weren’t truly random at all.\n\nIt appears the project changed hands, and the current status is unknown.\n\nMy advice has changed based on the above. I now recommend generating huge batches of bulk keys (at least thousands) and letting them age for an extended period of time so anyone watching basically gets bored and moves on.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out here again that EVERY key already exists. You can see this at https://privatekeys.pw/keys/dogecoin/1715798708377811353102561285298862253766002771547317750337289257500484134719 where you will see the keys are sequential.\n\nNote that every key is indeed discoverable. However because of the vast amount of time it takes, replicating a specific key is impossible. And checking the blockchain for large numbers of wallet addresses to see if they contain coins also becomes more impractical as the number of wallets and the amount of time increases. It becomes as impractical as checking every single wallet from that master list.\n\nOf course there are other ways of generating keys. You could fire up a client such as Core/QT, let it generate its hundred wallets, then dump them to a text file before throwing away the client again. Relatively quick and easy to do, and you can find instructions in the ELI5s or by searching for ‘DUMPWALLET’. You could use coinb.in offline to generate single wallets. You could use a handful of dice and a pencil. Or you could even pluck some random wallets from that list above.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter how you do it, because ALL wallets are identical in every way. There is a vanishingly small chance that any wallet can be generated more than once (assuming a truly random generation process). They are all equally secure and can all be compromised or lost in the same ways. And the way you record them is irrelevant, except that it alters the chances of discovery or loss.\n\nNow, as to your specific situation…\n\nWithout being able to look at your wallet, I can’t judge exactly what happened when. However I will point out that the code on https://github.com/walletgeneratornet/WalletGenerator.net hasn’t changed since before the vulnerabilities came about. Therefore I would assume you downloaded the code from the live site during the period it was vulnerable. And I would further assume that you immediately generated and used a physical paper wallet. This would have exposed your key, either because it phoned home or because the wallet you generated was one of a known non-random set. Either way, on checking the wallet and discovering coins in it, the bad actor was able to drain it either immediately or at a future point in time.\n\nOf course the coins are gone, and you can’t get them back. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean the perpetrator can get away cleanly. If you trace the coins after they were stolen, they would either have moved into another wallet where they remain, or they would have eventually landed on an exchange to be sold. If an exchange is involved, they would have records to identify the perpetrator. Records which law enforcement could use to track him down, depending on the jurisdictions involved. Don’t hold too much hope of recovery, but it’s not impossible. Unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nI’m truly sorry for your loss. But do realise that crypto is not a ‘set and forget’ thing. The advice around wallets has changed often, and continues to evolve. Things which we did in the past proved to be less than ideal, and ALL clients have caused people to lose their coins at some point in time. Hardware too, for that matter. Because the principle of never losing or revealing your keys is only as good as the way it’s implemented.\n\nAssuming this incident doesn’t drive you away, my current advice is to generate a large number of wallets and let them mellow, for years ideally, before use. I also recommend splitting coins across many wallets so one compromised key doesn’t lose everything. And any wallet that needs to be used immediately should be generated offline using a known safe method. Coinb.in, SoDogeTip, DogePal, dogecoinmultisig.org are all currently safe and operated by pillars of our community. Clients remain safe provided they are offline and provide a way to extract your keys. That key list I linked above is safe if you understand and use it appropriately. And of course the laborious manual approach is always there.\n\nFeel free to provide the wallet address so we can have a look at what happened when.', 12), ('It’s more complicated than that.

That post few days ago from ledger was because of a mass event that extended across multiple wallets where at some point in time the hacker had their seed phrases but delayed their attacks til recently. At least I think we’re talking about the same thing, the metamask hack right? Rather than it being the hardware itself, it’s the human behind it that allowed the exploit. For example, zero nonce hardware wallets were not affected during these attacks meaning it’s cryptographically secure.\n\n Even with all this, it is recommended to transfer funds to a new seed phrase once a year or a couple months whichever you see fit. It was also identified recently that 70% of the wallets were in scam projects that certik “audited” when they had their 90% discount. I’m not sure if certik is working together with these people but it’s something to take note of, the vulnerabilities are in blind signing approvals and signature back doors to your wallet etc.', 1), (""That's not true. Wallets are just numbers. Most all utxo model coins use the same set of numbers for their wallets."", 2), ('Hardware is no more or less secure than software or indeed just writing a key down.\n\nAnd I would argue that the impossibility of recovering derived keys from HD wallets makes them MORE risky as far as the human element is concerned. And of course you will remember the several people who sent their devices to landfill, and the guy who forgot his password with (at the time) $400 million in BTC in there.\n\nNo one is arguing the cryptographic security of 256-bit keys. We know that they are impossible to reverse-engineer, and we also understand the vanishingly long odds against accidental duplication. But this applies to ALL wallets, regardless of how they are stored.\n\nWhich makes that ‘change your keys’ argument fundamentally stupid. An argument which forms the basis for the whole idiotic HD concept in the first place.\n\nWhy idiotic? Precisely because the weak link is always the human. And the further you separate someone from their keys, the more likely that they will screw up. Or, as in the case of the Dough client and this Ledger case, that something will go wrong that you have no control over.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m no Luddite. But I’ve been bitten often enough over the years (including recently by lost ‘smart’ car keys, which is a whole ‘nother story) that I am very wary of opaque black box ‘idiot-proof’ solutions.\n\nAnd that’s why I see no substitute for carefully managing your own keys, offline and in a form you can read with your very own eyeballs. Everything else is trouble waiting to happen.', 1), ('Indeed. 256-bits is the same for all.\n\nBut the encoding of both addresses and keys differs. You can’t send BTC to a Doge wallet, can you?\n\nAnd yes, I’m aware that HD clients use the same seed for all supported coins. But this was a standard-issue wallet, not HD.', 2), (""That encoding isn't even part of the protocol. If you look at addresses as they are saved in the blockchain, they're just the hash of the public key. That's why you still see people complaining about sending their dogecoin to a bitcoin or litecoin address. Some software doesn't even pay attention to the address encoding."", 1), ('Well I wasn’t doing comparisons, they both use the same standard or at least they should. The difference is hardware and paper wallets are air gapped, creating a software wallet on an internet connection can leave you open to malware that steals keys upon creation. The problem isn’t the wallet creation itself but the fact antivirus software misses 30% of malware making it vaporware. If you do it from an air gapped method such as a hardware wallet it can’t happen, as there is no malware on creation to a local device. The rest is up to the human avoiding phishing attempts and crypto scams. Ofc this is always assuming the person behind is securing their seed from other forms(such as living with a roommate etc.) \n\nIts recommended to transfer funds to a new wallet after some time because after all the transactions you do you can’t be sure if you encountered a back door exploit through your blockchain network since there is so much blind signing in the eth network, for example. For example, eth has a permitless update that you can give access to spend funds with just a signature. The problem is you can’t track signatures like you can track approvals, this is why it’s recommended to transfer funds periodically precisely because people cannot remember every single transaction they did over a 5 year period for example, it’s more of a safety precaution. Even if you generated a new seed phrase and everyone generated one every day for as long as they lived they wouldn’t even get close to unlocking all the seed recovery phrases so it’s a harmless practice to cover yourself.', 1), ('Given the different prefixes for different coins, I’ve never understood people attempting to send the wrong type of coin.\n\nDo we really have to wrap people in cotton wool and bubble wrap to protect them from themselves?', 1), ('I would agree that isolation is key. Of course, the complexity and cost of the measures must relate to the value of what’s being protected. Like installing a bank vault to protect your used bubblegum collection would definitely be overkill.\n\nAlso, different people have different risk tolerance. I used to regularly get locked out of the house if I went into the garden without my keys. But since dad died, the door is almost never locked, and we’ve had zero incidents. YMMV.\n\nKeeping this discussion to Dogecoin for the moment, if you generate a key in any way whatsoever, what do you actually have? Let’s take this example I just whipped up…\n\n^**6JWVG6iskKiKZHHmpx26McyxKL69RGD6CDUuxnZGcYvoeTn12Vt**\n\nNow, I got that from walletgenerator, online. And I’ve now published it on Reddit, as I often do with examples. Therefore it’s compromised, obviously.\n\nHowever, is it inherently any less secure than any other key? Absolutely not. All keys are equally secure by design. The differing risk profiles come from the way they are handled.\n\nSo I could have used the GitHub source for walletgenerator, coinb.in, a random number generator or handful of dice and a pencil and a bit of hard work, offline, to generate that same key. I could have written it down with a pen or engraved it into a steel plate. Regardless of how I did it, as long as I was the only one who had it, and as long as I never lost it, it would be just as secure as it’s possible to be, and continue to be forever.\n\nAs for moving coins, there’s really only one reason to ever do that if you’re not spending them. And that’s to reduce the UTXO count so software doesn’t choke on it. And I published a three-wallet cascading solution to this many years ago, back when faucets were a thing. By flushing wallets when they hit a hundred UTXOs, that gives a million transactions (100*100*100) the set will handle without issues. Should be enough for anyone.\n\nOh, and I also advocate for separate wallets for each and every entity or purpose you interact with. Precisely because it provides not only privacy and security, but also auditability. Because humans are indeed forgetful.', 1), ('Ye agreed on humans being forgetful. I understand your point it’s just that the risk is a bit mitigated from the malware aspect if you do it offline. The reason is because browsers are insecure and by extension their browser extension would be as well. So if you take that element out the only other way would have to be someone irl would have to obtain your recovery phrase, you got phished out your recovery phrase, or you simply just forgot it and since humans are forgetful as you said, having a secure location no one can get to is vital, but even that is not always possible. So the best practice would be split your assets or shift your funds through multiple wallets to mitigate the risk of getting rekt all at once.', 1), ('+u/sodogetip 3 doge verify ❤️❤️\nFulvio one of our bests here', 3), ('Aww, shucks. Thanks. 🙇\u200d♂️', 3), ('Yep, we are in total agreement about being offline.\n\nSome people go so far as to use not only removable media, but an airgapped machine and secondary removable media to move signed transactions for broadcasting. A bit excessive for most purposes in my view, but hey, each to their own, right? And yes, I know people exactly like that. 🤷\u200d♂️\n\nI’ve already said I recommend many wallets. But I also recomm no multiple removable devices in separate locations so they can’t all be destroyed in a single disaster. I’m an Aussie, and we’ve had endless fires, floods and storms for years now, so this ranks right up there in terms of importance I think.\n\nIt’s the movement of coins that I beg to differ on though. Unless a wallet has been compromised, it offers zero protection and some small risks compared to just leaving coins be.\n\nBut the obvious question of course is, how do you know you’ve been compromised? And for that, it comes down to behaviour. Don’t do risky stuff like storing keys in the cloud obviously, but people do do exactly that, don’t they?

Starting with the americentricity, which is always toxic in a global community.\n\nBut mostly, I just completely reject the underlying premise of intelligent manipulation. I’ve got enough experience in the real world to know that’s a completely false bit of misinformation.\n\nThe reality is that large systems are made up of many moving parts. There is no ubiquitous guiding hand exerting a will and forcing some kind of master plan.\n\nThe moving parts in this case are people. Each of us takes individual small actions, which add up to force multipliers to great effect.\n\nTake climate change as an example. No one set out to destroy the planet. But billions of people individually and independently made countless decisions which had that effect. From the choice of cars the size of barges to individually-wrapped pieces of fruit to the killing of plants and animals, it has always been an individual who turned the key, pulled the trigger or wielded the axe. And while some did it because someone directed them to, the overwhelming majority simply didn’t think.\n\nThat’s the real underlying problem with the world. The wilful, deliberate lack of thought given to all manner of decisions. And the manipulation of that lack of thinking by a minority who do think about things, particularly how to use people against themselves.\n\nIt’s a pervasive problem, stretching across economies, social injustices, crime and violence, substance abuses, environmental damage, and pretty much everything we do, not as a nation, but as a planet.\n\nIndividuals hold the real power in all these things. They just need to recognise it and learn how to use it.', 2), ('We will move up all when I come...you will see...I feel and believe❤️🚀❤️', 1), ('Indeed. Thanks for your insight into the matter. I only state things from an American standpoint as it is where I am located, and where I planned to have the message be circulated from, as I was thinking that if we can come together to help this here, the rest of the world may take notice.\n\nYou are correct in saying that it stretches even further across multiple fronts such as the ones you stated and in order for a real change to take place we have to fix ourselves as individuals on multiple points before anything can ever happen.\n\nYou are also correct in the fact that the power needed rests within each, and every, single one of us. How are we able to get people to see that this is the first step to fixing the problem though?\n\nWe are killing our planet. It\'s a true fact that some refuse to see because ""Hey it\'s not just my fault, so why should I have to change?"". Our earth has always froze to heal itself and because of the damage we have done to the planet through recent technological advances we have a very real threat of the earth not being able to freeze. And if it does not freeze to recover the damage done to its atmospheres... The earth will burn when that time comes instead.\n\nI know there are other real threats out there as well such as A.I. but if we can\'t even unify under a type of currency the entire world can use how can we ever hope to solve any of the issues humanity has on a global level? People need to believe that change is possible and that it CAN happen if we just all work together.', 1), ('I know in my heart that the change for the greater good on a global level is possible.. But the starting point is what is eluding me. If we never start we can never finish. The problem will be the problem forever. That problem is US as a species.', 1), ('I get that, but you’re not going to fix the world by starting in the US.\n\nFrankly, the American mindset is irrational. Look at the refusal to even think about doing anything to reduce the death toll from mass shootings for example. Or making the health system fairer for another example.\n\nNow, there’s a certain left/right divide to most of this. The battle between the good of all versus the advantage of the rich and powerful. But that’s not the entirety of it.\n\nWe kicked out a right wing government last year which had done untold damage over a decade. Our new government has set about generational reforms. They are attempting to change the constitution to give indigenous people a voice they’ve never had. They are doubling the supply of certain drugs provided for the same subsidised fee, to name two. The right are opposing both of course. Or should I say those who currently profit from the situation are.\n\nThe problem in the US is that so much of the cultural identity is founded on the ‘greed is good’ model, and the opposing view has little power because of the extremely deep pockets on the right. Fortunes built on death and destruction, and tentacles that reach right across the globe. That’s not going away anytime soon. Not without massive wealth redistribution which the political system simply does not allow.\n\nLook at the four years of an orange imbecile who took the world to the brink and who is inherently dishonest to the point of facing a slew of legal actions. And yet there is a real danger of his return to power? Seriously? Such a person is not fit for power, yet the system allows sufficient manipulation to give it to him on a silver platter.\n\nBut to get back to crypto, I’m afraid that it isn’t the answer to any of this. Not only is it fundamentally incapable of replacing fiat, precisely because of the same features that make it secure and incorruptible, but even if it were possible, it would do nothing for the real issues that face us.\n\nAlso, the planet is not sentient. It doesn’t act to heal itself or anything else. It simply reacts to a multitude of inputs. Since we now control many of those inputs, we inevitably control the reactions as well. Up to a point.\n\nLet’s look at the freeze cycle for instance. The northern hemisphere is kept relatively comfortable for human life because of warm ocean currents which encircle the globe. These currents are dependent on the relative densities of part of the water column, which maintain a temperature differential. But if those densities alter, the currents will alter and can indeed stop. Many years ago, I was shown ice cores from Antarctica, where anomalies were visible from some 15,000 years ago. Analysis of the air bubbles trapped in them indicated that there had been a massive spike in greenhouse gasses over a very short span of a year or two. The explanation the scientists gave me was that melting land ice had decreased the salinity of the oceans. This allowed the masses of methane which sit trapped in the organic matter on the sea floor at the mouth of every river to bubble up to the surface and into the atmosphere. The result was almost instant, and the ocean currents stopped.\n\nThere was a recent example of this phenomenon when an African lake killed an entire community on its shores after its sediments were disturbed by tremors. Everyone died in their sleep, without warning.\n\nNow, we can continue to ignore these things. We can continue to allow vested interests to make money off activities which put the world at risk. We can continue to elect people who are bought and sold by the rich and powerful. And we will suffer the consequences as the changes become irreversible.\n\nThe world cannot be destroyed. Not until it’s ultimate end in three billion years anyway. Life cannot be destroyed either. We’ve had seven extinction events which killed almost all life, and the ecosystem recovered after each. It will again. But we may not be around to see it.\n\nAnd there’s the real issue. Do we care more about our continued existence and relative comfort, or do we sell our souls and our future for greed, money and power?', 2), ('But if not the U.S, Where?\nThe start always has to happen somewhere.\nEvery single person on this planet is capable of great things. We have been taught in our schools that self love isn\'t important and that we must spend all our time focusing on school, work, bills, and things of that nature. When what should be being taught is Joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, faith, and trust.\n\nTo think that we can just scoot by and not have to worry about the current state of things because it\'s just going to end up being the next persons problem is the reason the world is the way it is.\nWe are too busy sitting back and watching the world destroy itself to think ""Hey, Maybe we should do something about this.""\nI do agree that maybe crypto isn\'t the answer to solve the first issue we have, But what other options do we actually have? We can go to Africa and feed and provide medical care to their people but as soon as the help leaves, so does the change that was trying to be made. The same is true for every issue we currently face. We can\'t just do something for a set period of time and call it good... It is a continuous effort that needs to be applied throughout the rest of time.\n\nThere is some very ancient scripts and knowledge, some of which the Bible shamlessly plagiarized, that speaks of the exact issues currently going on in the world and says that the time of the web of interconnectivity of knowledge the planet will eventually have will be the time for change. If it is not me who follows through and kicks this whole thing off, It is just going to be someone else somewhere farther down the line when things are even worse.\n\nI have an intense love for each and every single person on this planet regardless of who they are and wether or not I ever meet them, because I know the change we require needs unity among the mass that is humanity.\n\nIf we don\'t start now, That is simply just time wasted. You may not believe in me, But I believe in me, and that\'s enough for me to try my hardest to make a positive impact on this world. Cryptocurrency or not.', 1), ('Europe has already started, and has made many improvements in recent years.\n\nBut the obvious starting place is India. It is now the most populous nation on earth, and unlike China, it is a democracy. And it is intent on improving the lives of all its people. Improvements which must come without the negative impacts western consumer societies have imposed on the planet. And there is plenty of scope, especially around energy and agriculture.\n\nThis is not to say that the US or any other nation can simply sit by and do nothing of course. But the likelihood of major systemic change is low, simply because of the vested self-interests opposing it.\n\nIndividual action can of course bring about change. If everyone stops buying guns, suddenly the gun lobby loses its power. If everyone stops buying monster trucks, there goes much of the influence of the oil industry. Put solar panels on every house, and the coal industry disappears. And so on and so forth.\n\nBut good luck convincing people to change their ways.', 1), ('Thank you for your time.

NFTs are a joke.... so they should be on Dogecoin!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7b6zzbjfgk0b1.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc882c4e2250f664ebee298eab74f3edb4234d8

Hello everyone! 

I am a guy from Germany that spent more time than he likes to admit on an NFT-Protocol for the Dogecoin Blockchain. And since everything seems to be working great it's finally time to at least tease the idea of NFTs on the Dogecoin blockchain.

That being said, I know that NFTs are a disputed topic and probably not everyone wants to see them on Dogecoin...

Therefore I will at first only release my own NFT-Collection (see details below) before setting up an environment in which everybody can deploy their own NFT-contracts on the dogecoin blockchain.

This will remove the risk of network congestion and will give enough time to analyze the effectiveness and security of the protocol before releasing it into the wild.

&amp;#x200B;

The Dogecoin NFT Protocol only uses regular Dogecoin transactions. 

So unlike Smart Contracts it isn't something directly integrated into the blockchain but instead acts as a layer on top of Dogecoin.

More details about the implementation will follow soon. Probably at first in the form of a video since I feel it will be easier to explain stuff that way.

A Whitepaper would likely follow after that.

&amp;#x200B;

The protocol currently supports the following functionality:

* creation of ""dumb contracts""
* add/update contract metadata
* add/remove contract owners
* mint/burn/transfer/sell/buy NFTs

&amp;#x200B;

My own NFT collection is a trading card game based around a fictional war between all cryptocurrencies called ""The Crypto Conflict"".

You can use your NFTs to virtually support and attack cryptocurrencies. 

Supporting a currency with your cards will increase its military power while attacking will reduce its military power.

There is a leaderboard on the homepage that will always display which cryptocurrency currently has the most military power.

The website is already online (though only for testing purposes) at [www.cryptoconflict.net](https://www.cryptoconflict.net)

There you can also view all of the 52 cards that will be available at launch.

Each card has a (hopefully) funny design and flavor text about cryptocurrency or trading related terminology. The card images were drawn by [graphyjeffy](https://www.fiverr.com/graphyjeffy) on fiverr.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I writing this here?

* I am looking for beta testers, especially people that would be willing to download dogecoin core and the whole dogecoin testnet blockchain. (They could then test each function themselves).
* I would really like to hear some feedback both about NFTs on Dogecoin in general and about my own NFT collection.
* Advertisement  :D

&amp;#x200B;

"Not a financial expert, but some advice that helped me","Is see a lot of people talking about the dip, and asking when the price will surge again. Whether they should Hodl, buy more, or sell. 

Ultimately it will be based on the person themselves. Where I’m at right now I feel I would feel more upset if I sold everything and the price skyrocketed in an amount that would help me than if I were to lose it all in a Dogecoin crash. 

Because of this I will pop on Reddit everyone now and then to see if there’s any news, but I do my best not to obsessively watch Dogecoin price and my earning. It creates far too much stress and gives me an unrealistic expectation for it. 

As others have said here, it may take years before it hits a high prices IF it even does. It’s best to not only have a diverse portfolio, only invest what you’re comfortable losing, and keep expectations realistic. Would it be amazing if Dogecoin hit $10 this year? Absolutely.

How to recover Dogecoin lost in the transaction？,"Excuse me, I have a question want to ask

You could end up with some later versions of a wallet.dat file that don't have the same keys as a previous version had.\n\nYou need to research this pretty well, and make copies of all your current wallet.dat files before trying anything.  Label them well, so you can differentiate them.\n\nI would be inclined to use the command line to dump all private keys from every wallet.dat, then import them to a single one.  But I could be wrong.\n\nFulvio may have a better idea.  u/Fulvio55 thoughts?"", 2), ('Well, not quite.\n\nWhen launched for the first time, Core/QT generates a hundred wallets and sticks them in the wallet.dat (note that the wallets ARE the keys, and the addresses are derived from them, not something separate).\n\nIt then hands you one to use. Then every time you ask for another, or every time you spend coins, it picks another from its pool to use. And if it runs out, then it generates another hundred.\n\nSo all backups will contain the same wallets, but they won’t be marked as used in earlier copies. This is why it’s critical to backup after every spend. Because people who don’t manage their own wallets will be unaware of how things work, and that all their coins may well be in a change wallet they don’t know about. People have lost millions by failing to follow this advice.\n\nUsing DUMPWALLET to export the wallets and then throwing Core away is absolutely my advice for everyone. Because it forces you to actually think about what you’re doing and to learn to manage your wallets yourself.\n\nWhere the UTXO count comes in is that every client has a limit of how many it can handle. For ‘lite’ clients it is generally 50. For Core its 600. And for most everything else, including online services and scripts such as coinb.in its 100. Therefore it pays to keep an eye on it and to consolidate.coins so as to keep the count below 100. And it’s also good for the network as well, since they take up RAM space in the mempool on every node, which is a much more limited resource than disk space for the blockchain.', 1), ('See my answer to /u/terran777 below.\n\nAlso, search here for ‘text wallet’ and have a read.\n\nAnd absolutely stop using Core, or any other client. You don’t need it, and you can keep as many wallets as you could possibly desire in a plain ordinary text file on removable media. That gives you secure cold storage, and grabbing a copy of coinb.in gives you a way to spend coins from any wallet without exposing your keys to the internet.', 1), ('My problem is solved, the lost coin is back.
