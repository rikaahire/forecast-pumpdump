Light version of Dogecoin wallet is not supported any more?,"Hi all,

I just realised Dogecoin does not support a light version wallet like MultiDoge any more?

So this moment the only offical wallet is the Dogecoin Core?

Anybody knows?

Many thanks!",2,3,2023-04-18 06:03:21,,dogecoin,,"[('These are not wallets. They are software clients. Because wallets are not software, they‚Äôre numbers, that‚Äôs all. And you don‚Äôt need software to have a number, do you?\n\nTo be clear, you do not need a client at all to have as many thousands of wallets as your little heart desires. Just go to walletgenerator.net and run off a big heap in the bulk tab, then let them ‚Äòmellow‚Äô for as long as possible before use, because anything exposed to the internet can be compromised. Therefore, letting enough time pass that bad guys will stop checking wallets is always a good idea.\n\nOr, you can go to https://privatekeys.pw/keys/dogecoin/405367151004111983960333312545766754610509000105382894697474272261018047099 and grab a few wallets, after hitting the random button a few times of course. Again, let them age.\n\nOr, you could fire up Core, let it build its files, then use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with a hundred wallets in it. At which point you can delete the client, as you don‚Äôt need it.\n\nAnd, since you do need a way to spend coins, and since coinb.in supports Doge and importantly can be downloaded and run offline, you could use it to generate single wallets as well.\n\nHowever you get your wallets, never ever expose them to the internet. Keep them offline on multiple removable media stored in safe places where they won‚Äôt all get destroyed by fire, flood, etc.\n\nNow, as to why old clients aren‚Äôt available anymore? It‚Äôs pretty simple really. Most of these things are one-man shows, and people are notorious for losing interest and abandoning projects. I should know, I wrote a book about coins (the real world metal things) that I haven‚Äôt bothered updating since 2016. One day, maybe‚Ä¶\n\nAlso, so-called ‚Äòlite‚Äô wallets come with a bunch of gotchas that have led to many people losing their coins. For starters, file formats are unique and incompatible between them. And they have severe UTXO limits which can cause crashes and make coins unspendable. And while they don‚Äôt require the full blockchain, they do require access to the internet so they can download relevant necessary blocks.\n\nContrast this with a simple script like coinb.in, which loads UTXOs on the fly from your choice of networks, and which can operate entirely offline except for the loading and eventual broadcast of the signed transaction. Plus, because the keys are always readable, you‚Äôre never going to get locked out by software issues.\n\nThat cover it for you?', 3), (""Thanks!\n\nIt's so technical that I don't understand most of it but appreciate your help!\n\nAnyway, you are telling me that this light version does not exist anymore if I'm not wrong!"", 2), ('I‚Äôm not saying that lite clients don‚Äôt exist. I am saying they are unnecessary and definitely not recommended.\n\nAs for being technical, no, not at all. It‚Äôs actually really, really simple, but it does take a little effort to get your head around it.\n\nThis is all explained in the ELI5s, but the key parts are these‚Ä¶\n\nA wallet is a 256-bit number, basically. They all exist, have always existed, and will always exist.\n\nBecause the numbers are so big, it‚Äôs almost impossible to randomly pick one that‚Äôs already been used. This is the core of the security of crypto. You cannot reverse engineer a key, and you can‚Äôt guess it. Therefore, you better not lose it, ever, cos you can‚Äôt get it back.\n\nCoins don‚Äôt live in wallets. They live on the blockchain, in UTXOs tagged with the address of the owning wallet.\n\nMoving coins is simply a matter of writing an instruction to move them from where they are to new UTXOs belonging to the receiving wallets you choose. You sign these instructions with your secret private key, and then you broadcast the signed transaction to the network of nodes. And in a minute or two, miners will add it to the blockchain.\n\nIf you understand that, you‚Äôve got pretty much everything you need. The rest you will pick up over time, but it‚Äôs not critical.', 1)]"

Do you see whats going to happen when dogecoin payment for Twitter subscriptions is enabled?,"Elon Musk keeps mentioning that creators on Twitter will get all the proceeds from subscriptions minus transaction fees. See these tweets:

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241)

The current fees for IOS/Android are 30% so creators will only keep 70% of the money subscribers pay, and the fee for the web via Credit Card/Stripe is 8% so creators will only keep 92% of the the money subscribers pay.

If layer one dogecoin payments are enabled the fees will be as low as .001 doge (or basically free). With the transaction fees being so low with a dogecoin payment option, creators will get 99.999999% of the subscription fee. If the creators get this much more via a dogecoin payment method it follows that of course a lot of creators will push for their subscribers to use dogecoin and a lot of their subscribers will because they would rather their money go to the person they are subscribing to rather than Android/Apple/CC companies.

If a large amount of big twitter accounts, many of which are not even crypto related, are asking their subscribers to pay in Dogecoin how do you think that will play out? üöÄ",142,55,2023-04-18 11:18:03,,dogecoin,,"[(""It'll be massive in the short-term.

Millions were lost millions and millions. Lots of us I‚Äôm sure are also having a hard time figuring out why on earth our old mined doge was put in Cryptsy.

The settlers of the case need to release and make open for claims of doge and other misc coins. Or those who have the wallets and haven‚Äôt cashed out, I beg of you, please allow claims and give back to the community.

Y'all know what happened on 420 Doge Day year after year and we just don't learn, all this is just gonna make the vulnerable more vulnerable and the newbies turn against us. We are Dogecoin supporters. We are family. Trust the process. Honestly Elon like the currency because we here and the creators valued memes.

DogeDayDoesntExist,"Look at every single ""doge day"" in dogecoin's history. I used trading view and chose the ""dogeusd bitrex"" chart because it has the most historical data for doge out of all the charts I could find on trading view

4/20/2022 - doge dropped 1.16%
Within 3 weeks it dropped over 50%

4/20/2021- doge dropped 22.65% and dropped over 60% 3 days after

4/20/2020 - doge dropped 3.61% this time it actually increased in price after dropping for 2 days. Small drop. But still a red ""doge day"". It increased 37% over 10 days and proceeded to be stagnant for about 2 months with a decline I'm price over that time. 37% in growth in the week/days after dogeday, pales in comparison to the previous 50% and 60% drops we saw in the 2 years to follow this day.

4/20/2019
This time, doge had a green day on ""doge day"" it gained .05% in value and proceeded to drop over 15% in value 7 days later.

4/20/2018
Doge increased in price by 1.98%, so far this is the best price gains we've seen for doge on ""doge day"". From this day on, doge proceeded to drop around 60% before it found a low.

4/20/2017
Doge dropped just over 2%. This is probably the best ""dogeday"" in doge's history because after this day, doge totaled in increase of over 800% before finding its top. To be fair though, this was in the middle of the 2017 bull market. We are definitely not in the middle of the bull now. Perhaps the beginning, but we could very well still be in a bear market as well. Long story short. The day was was still red. And this day occurred in completely different market conditions. 

4/20/2016
Doge increased 1.36% and proceeded to pump about 7% more in the coming days. This may be the only iteration where ""dogeday"" could actually be argued as legitimate. However, this ""dogeday"" did not occur at the begging of its rally but at the end. Doge remained range bound for another month after topping out around the 26th.

4/20/2015
Doge increased  .6%. The months that followed provided volatility and stagnation. But ""dogeday"", yet again, was irrelevant.

That is all the dogedays I could find on tradingview.

With the data provided, ""dogeday"" had 4 green iterations and 4 red iterations.

Statistically this day is a big ol ""nothing burger""

Doge day doesn't exist. Don't get your hopes up. Keep in mind that dogecoin has been on an upward trend since March 11th of this year with a total increase of around 67-68% in gains in about a month's time. 

What's that old saying? Buy high, sell low? 

No. It's buy low and sell high.

I'll leave you with this question.

Reality check on the price of dogecoin,"Let me be blunt:  The price of dogecoin has absolutely nothing to do with Elon's antics... Twitter, SpaceX, Tesla... completely irrelevant.

The only reason the ATH got as high as it did was because the news was reporting on it.  Elon's tweets may have bumped it a bit, but the main boost was all the news coverage of that event, which got us a lot of exposure.  Unless the headline were ""SpaceX to launch Starship funded by Dogecoin"", this launch had no chance.

The only reason we're seeing a slight increase right now is because there's a lot of people buying in the hopes that the launch would actually raise the price.

The only thing that will raise the price is the amount that gets purchased and the number of people who want to get in on it.  Buying the dip and hodling is the only way for the price to go up.  BUT when the price goes up, DON'T sell, because the more you sell, the more the market gets diluted, the faster the price drops again.

This is how pump and dumps work.  Someone (e.g. Elon) gets everyone else to buy, which pumps the price for a bit, then they dump all their coin, which make the price drop again.  They make a killing and the rest of us suffer.

This is not FUD, this is basic economics.

THAT ALL BEING SAID, I'm still hodling my 100K and will continue to do so, not because I expect to get rich, but because I believe in the coin and what it represents.  The very fact that it is so stable, speaks to the power of the coin and it's ability to be a currency.  People buying and selling and investing turn it into a commodity.  The only chance for us to go to the moon is for people to use it as a currency.  Buy and then use it to purchase goods and services.

Dogecoin‚Äôs Popularity Wanes As Rivals Emerge: What Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin has been facing struggles as other memecoins gain popularity, causing a significant reduction in its investor community. Despite experiencing a 20 percent spike in value year-to-date, the digital currency has dropped by approximately 5.39 percent this week, trading at around $0.084 on Friday.

Other coins such as $PEPE and $WOJAK have emerged and contributed to the decline in Dogecoin's popularity. However, Dogecoin still maintains its position as one of the most traded and liquid digital assets, with around 5.4 million holders, according to on-chain data.

The market for Dogecoin is still dominated by whale traders, who execute large transactions worth millions of dollars. In the past 24 hours alone, several transactions involving millions of dollars have been processed on the Dogecoin chain, demonstrating the continued influence of whale traders on the market.

According to analysts, traders can expect an altcoin season in the near future, with mapped-out levels for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

Raising money to fix a bike.,"Henlo Shibas. 

I would like to raise money to fix a kids bicycle.

He took it apart hoping to fix it ( He is12 years old) but it turned out He can¬¥t and broke the parts ( Shift,brakes and even the chain). I promised to the family I try to fix it ( I thought it¬¥s an easy assembling job but I didn¬¥t know the parts are literally broken). 

I wrote a list for them what I need to repair on the bike ( cost 100-150 ‚Ç¨) but They said it¬¥s too much money but they wouldn¬¥t accept my money but I know the bike is very important for the boy,

So ladies and gentleman I found my old PHYSICAL DOGECOIN and I would like to sell it just for as much as it gonna cover the repair cost. 

So if someone would donate or buy the coin from me please let me know.

Of course I¬¥m gonna send the receipt from the parts and pictures how the repair goes.

Maybe it¬¥s a silly idea but that¬¥s all I can do.

Thank YOU for the attention.

However, if you have faith in the asset, invest and hold onto it for 5+ years. The reality is that Dogecoin is poised to skyrocket, and by investing now and holding onto it, you stand to earn far more than by attempting to time the market with every dip.

It's important to note that reducing volatility is crucial to improving public perception and gaining widespread adoption of Dogecoin. The faster this happens, the quicker the public will gain respect for the asset and embrace it.",1,0,2023-04-24 21:15:24,,dogecoin,,[]

How did they steal all my Dogecoin and what can I do about it?,"About three years ago, I bought a lot of dogecoin on Binance. 

Then, to make it safer, I followed the instructions on this page to get in into a paper wallet: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin\_paper\_wallet\_tutorial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin_paper_wallet_tutorial/)

I disconnected my computer from the internet, generated several paper wallets from walletgenerator, and then sent the coins to a wallet. I printed off the paper wallets, and have never saved the wallets to my computer or showed them to a friend or anything. 

I never did anything with the Dogecoin. Never linked it to any sort of online account or app. Never entered the wallet information into any sort of website. Never sent any Dogecoin from it, or did I ever put any more into it. I just left it alone.

Today, I decided to see how it's doing, only to discover that back in November, someone stole all the dogecoin out of the wallet. It is empty. Gone.

Needless to say, I'm freaking out. Is there anything I can do?

Not sketchy at all.', 2), ('OK, so without looking at your actual wallet(s) and doing some forensics, here‚Äôs a generic answer‚Ä¶\n\nWallets, as you may know, are nothing but numbers. As in the private keys. And all numbers already exist, have always existed and cannot be created nor destroyed.\n\nBut, you can know or not know a number. Therefore the important thing is for you to never either lose or reveal your keys to anyone.\n\nNow, as to walletgenerator, there have been a couple of security issues over the years, which allowed someone else to gain access to keys.\n\nThe first was a clone site which phoned home with every key it generated. That was discovered, people were warned by the people behind the legitimate site, and it was eventually taken down.\n\nThe second was a change in the code that basically allowed keys to be reissued, so they weren‚Äôt truly random at all.\n\nIt appears the project changed hands, and the current status is unknown.\n\nMy advice has changed based on the above. I now recommend generating huge batches of bulk keys (at least thousands) and letting them age for an extended period of time so anyone watching basically gets bored and moves on.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth pointing out here again that EVERY key already exists. You can see this at https://privatekeys.pw/keys/dogecoin/1715798708377811353102561285298862253766002771547317750337289257500484134719 where you will see the keys are sequential.\n\nNote that every key is indeed discoverable. However because of the vast amount of time it takes, replicating a specific key is impossible. And checking the blockchain for large numbers of wallet addresses to see if they contain coins also becomes more impractical as the number of wallets and the amount of time increases. It becomes as impractical as checking every single wallet from that master list.\n\nOf course there are other ways of generating keys. You could fire up a client such as Core/QT, let it generate its hundred wallets, then dump them to a text file before throwing away the client again. Relatively quick and easy to do, and you can find instructions in the ELI5s or by searching for ‚ÄòDUMPWALLET‚Äô. You could use coinb.in offline to generate single wallets. You could use a handful of dice and a pencil. Or you could even pluck some random wallets from that list above.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt really matter how you do it, because ALL wallets are identical in every way. There is a vanishingly small chance that any wallet can be generated more than once (assuming a truly random generation process). They are all equally secure and can all be compromised or lost in the same ways. And the way you record them is irrelevant, except that it alters the chances of discovery or loss.\n\nNow, as to your specific situation‚Ä¶\n\nWithout being able to look at your wallet, I can‚Äôt judge exactly what happened when. However I will point out that the code on https://github.com/walletgeneratornet/WalletGenerator.net hasn‚Äôt changed since before the vulnerabilities came about. Therefore I would assume you downloaded the code from the live site during the period it was vulnerable. And I would further assume that you immediately generated and used a physical paper wallet. This would have exposed your key, either because it phoned home or because the wallet you generated was one of a known non-random set. Either way, on checking the wallet and discovering coins in it, the bad actor was able to drain it either immediately or at a future point in time.\n\nOf course the coins are gone, and you can‚Äôt get them back. However, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the perpetrator can get away cleanly. If you trace the coins after they were stolen, they would either have moved into another wallet where they remain, or they would have eventually landed on an exchange to be sold. If an exchange is involved, they would have records to identify the perpetrator. Records which law enforcement could use to track him down, depending on the jurisdictions involved. Don‚Äôt hold too much hope of recovery, but it‚Äôs not impossible. Unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nI‚Äôm truly sorry for your loss. But do realise that crypto is not a ‚Äòset and forget‚Äô thing. The advice around wallets has changed often, and continues to evolve. Things which we did in the past proved to be less than ideal, and ALL clients have caused people to lose their coins at some point in time. Hardware too, for that matter. Because the principle of never losing or revealing your keys is only as good as the way it‚Äôs implemented.\n\nAssuming this incident doesn‚Äôt drive you away, my current advice is to generate a large number of wallets and let them mellow, for years ideally, before use. I also recommend splitting coins across many wallets so one compromised key doesn‚Äôt lose everything. And any wallet that needs to be used immediately should be generated offline using a known safe method. Coinb.in, SoDogeTip, DogePal, dogecoinmultisig.org are all currently safe and operated by pillars of our community. Clients remain safe provided they are offline and provide a way to extract your keys. That key list I linked above is safe if you understand and use it appropriately. And of course the laborious manual approach is always there.\n\nFeel free to provide the wallet address so we can have a look at what happened when.', 12), ('It‚Äôs more complicated than that.

For example, zero nonce hardware wallets were not affected during these attacks meaning it‚Äôs cryptographically secure.\n\n Even with all this, it is recommended to transfer funds to a new seed phrase once a year or a couple months whichever you see fit. It was also identified recently that 70% of the wallets were in scam projects that certik ‚Äúaudited‚Äù when they had their 90% discount. I‚Äôm not sure if certik is working together with these people but it‚Äôs something to take note of, the vulnerabilities are in blind signing approvals and signature back doors to your wallet etc.', 1), (""That's not true.

And of course you will remember the several people who sent their devices to landfill, and the guy who forgot his password with (at the time) $400 million in BTC in there.\n\nNo one is arguing the cryptographic security of 256-bit keys. We know that they are impossible to reverse-engineer, and we also understand the vanishingly long odds against accidental duplication. But this applies to ALL wallets, regardless of how they are stored.\n\nWhich makes that ‚Äòchange your keys‚Äô argument fundamentally stupid. An argument which forms the basis for the whole idiotic HD concept in the first place.\n\nWhy idiotic? Precisely because the weak link is always the human. And the further you separate someone from their keys, the more likely that they will screw up. Or, as in the case of the Dough client and this Ledger case, that something will go wrong that you have no control over.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm no Luddite. But I‚Äôve been bitten often enough over the years (including recently by lost ‚Äòsmart‚Äô car keys, which is a whole ‚Äònother story) that I am very wary of opaque black box ‚Äòidiot-proof‚Äô solutions.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs why I see no substitute for carefully managing your own keys, offline and in a form you can read with your very own eyeballs.

But this was a standard-issue wallet, not HD.', 2), (""That encoding isn't even part of the protocol. If you look at addresses as they are saved in the blockchain, they're just the hash of the public key. That's why you still see people complaining about sending their dogecoin to a bitcoin or litecoin address. Some software doesn't even pay attention to the address encoding."", 1), ('Well I wasn‚Äôt doing comparisons, they both use the same standard or at least they should. The difference is hardware and paper wallets are air gapped, creating a software wallet on an internet connection can leave you open to malware that steals keys upon creation. The problem isn‚Äôt the wallet creation itself but the fact antivirus software misses 30% of malware making it vaporware. If you do it from an air gapped method such as a hardware wallet it can‚Äôt happen, as there is no malware on creation to a local device. The rest is up to the human avoiding phishing attempts and crypto scams. Ofc this is always assuming the person behind is securing their seed from other forms(such as living with a roommate etc.) \n\nIts recommended to transfer funds to a new wallet after some time because after all the transactions you do you can‚Äôt be sure if you encountered a back door exploit through your blockchain network since there is so much blind signing in the eth network, for example. For example, eth has a permitless update that you can give access to spend funds with just a signature. The problem is you can‚Äôt track signatures like you can track approvals, this is why it‚Äôs recommended to transfer funds periodically precisely because people cannot remember every single transaction they did over a 5 year period for example, it‚Äôs more of a safety precaution. Even if you generated a new seed phrase and everyone generated one every day for as long as they lived they wouldn‚Äôt even get close to unlocking all the seed recovery phrases so it‚Äôs a harmless practice to cover yourself.', 1), ('Given the different prefixes for different coins, I‚Äôve never understood people attempting to send the wrong type of coin.\n\nDo we really have to wrap people in cotton wool and bubble wrap to protect them from themselves?', 1), ('I would agree that isolation is key.

YMMV.\n\nKeeping this discussion to Dogecoin for the moment, if you generate a key in any way whatsoever, what do you actually have? Let‚Äôs take this example I just whipped up‚Ä¶\n\n^**6JWVG6iskKiKZHHmpx26McyxKL69RGD6CDUuxnZGcYvoeTn12Vt**\n\nNow, I got that from walletgenerator, online. And I‚Äôve now published it on Reddit, as I often do with examples. Therefore it‚Äôs compromised, obviously.\n\nHowever, is it inherently any less secure than any other key? Absolutely not. All keys are equally secure by design. The differing risk profiles come from the way they are handled.\n\nSo I could have used the GitHub source for walletgenerator, coinb.in, a random number generator or handful of dice and a pencil and a bit of hard work, offline, to generate that same key. I could have written it down with a pen or engraved it into a steel plate. Regardless of how I did it, as long as I was the only one who had it, and as long as I never lost it, it would be just as secure as it‚Äôs possible to be, and continue to be forever.\n\nAs for moving coins, there‚Äôs really only one reason to ever do that if you‚Äôre not spending them. And that‚Äôs to reduce the UTXO count so software doesn‚Äôt choke on it. And I published a three-wallet cascading solution to this many years ago, back when faucets were a thing. By flushing wallets when they hit a hundred UTXOs, that gives a million transactions (100*100*100) the set will handle without issues. Should be enough for anyone.\n\nOh, and I also advocate for separate wallets for each and every entity or purpose you interact with. Precisely because it provides not only privacy and security, but also auditability. Because humans are indeed forgetful.', 1), ('Ye agreed on humans being forgetful. I understand your point it‚Äôs just that the risk is a bit mitigated from the malware aspect if you do it offline. The reason is because browsers are insecure and by extension their browser extension would be as well. So if you take that element out the only other way would have to be someone irl would have to obtain your recovery phrase, you got phished out your recovery phrase, or you simply just forgot it and since humans are forgetful as you said, having a secure location no one can get to is vital, but even that is not always possible. So the best practice would be split your assets or shift your funds through multiple wallets to mitigate the risk of getting rekt all at once.', 1), ('+u/sodogetip 3 doge verify ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\nFulvio one of our bests here', 3), ('Aww, shucks. Thanks. üôá\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è', 3), ('Yep, we are in total agreement about being offline.\n\nSome people go so far as to use not only removable media, but an airgapped machine and secondary removable media to move signed transactions for broadcasting. A bit excessive for most purposes in my view, but hey, each to their own, right? And yes, I know people exactly like that. ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI‚Äôve already said I recommend many wallets. But I also recomm no multiple removable devices in separate locations so they can‚Äôt all be destroyed in a single disaster. I‚Äôm an Aussie, and we‚Äôve had endless fires, floods and storms for years now, so this ranks right up there in terms of importance I think.\n\nIt‚Äôs the movement of coins that I beg to differ on though. Unless a wallet has been compromised, it offers zero protection and some small risks compared to just leaving coins be.\n\nBut the obvious question of course is, how do you know you‚Äôve been compromised? And for that, it comes down to behaviour. Don‚Äôt do risky stuff like storing keys in the cloud obviously, but people do do exactly that, don‚Äôt they? So just how much can you protect people from themselves? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è', 1), ('Unfortunately you can‚Äôt protect people from themselves lol.', 1), ('Yes, and it‚Äôs terribly saddening. ü•∫', 1), ('[removed]', 1), ('[removed]', 1), ('The sheer time taken to help another is the marvel to be had within this website.

That‚Äôs why many services offer the option of choosing your own, significant number.\n\nIf you do forget it, it has no way of knowing you‚Äôre not a thief. And depending on what you‚Äôre trying to unlock, it may have a limited number of retries. Like you only get something like three tries with an ATM, or an iPhone, and then there was the guy who had ten tries on a hardware device that had $400 million in BTC on it. He guessed wrong nine times last I heard.\n\nWhich of course is why I advocate for storing your keys as plain, readable text in text wallets on removable devices.

My vision for an update on doge,"I think that in order for dogecoin to rise it‚Äôll have to meet in the middle ground of the two communities the long term investors and average spenders of the coin. I suggest a soft cap that is minted each year, since an estimated 10,000 coins are minted each minute (5 billion) and will continue to rise with more miners making the value go down. If we could make it where only 3,472 coins were minted a minute it would significantly increase the value and in turn the popularity",10,14,2023-04-30 20:37:39,,dogecoin,,"[('Smaller mining rewards will make mining less profitable which may lead to fewer miners.\n\nWhat would this proposal need to do to counteract that result?', 3), ('We want world currency, maybe 20,000 coins a minute would be better...', 3), ('That would lead to higher inflation of dogecoin which I believe would have many people lose their faith in doge.

This means the growth rate of Dogecoin‚Äôs money supply is actually decreasing. In other words, Dogecoin‚Äôs money supply is disinflationary.""\n\n- Tyler Winklevoss, GEMINI', 4), ('From what I could find it only happens every 4 years and a reduction of 10% but perhaps another middle ground is making it every two years with a 5% reduction that way less coins are minted but still subtle enough', 2), ('[deleted]', 2), ('No.', 1), ('[deleted]', 1), ('‚òùÔ∏è', 1), ('Not saying they should stop just a reduction/slowdown', 2), ('[deleted]', 0), ('Why?', 1), ('Lowering supply does not create demand.

No demand for them as real projects, just moonshot gambling is the only short term utility those cryptos serve.\n\nAnd all will vanish.\n\nThe supply factor, as discussed in the crypto sphere and crypto subs, is a red herring.  As if children were told about basic supply and demand equation in 5th grade, and that\'s all the economic education they received since. A total lack of macro economic theory exposure, and now they\'ve all grown up and fill the crypto subs like lemmings.\n\n""supply supply supply""\n\n![gif](giphy|VR26KGhBQFmnF3q6yJ)\n\nYou want to tinker with the new issuance rate. Not because it\'s the fundamentally correct thing to do.  But because it\'ll appease the masses/lemmings, and we\'ll see a large influx of new buyers, the price will shoot up in the short term, and people can unload their bags. Then the price will collapse, and/or the new buyers will say ""hey, we also want another new issuance rate reduction, so we too can unload our bags too"".  Wash. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nThe 3.8% (and dropping) new issuance rate seems good to me.  Lowering it will increase short term speculative investment, and we already have a good balance of that.', 6), ('[deleted]', 1), (""No it wouldn't.  The transaction fees are paid in previously minted coins."", 1), ('This‚òùÔ∏è', 2), ('[deleted]', 1), ('You actually have no clue how blockchain works, do you?', 1), ('Don‚Äôt have much of a clue, do you?\n\nNor do you appear capable of searching, since this has been done to death many thousands of times here already.\n\nDoge already has a hard cap. Exactly 10,000 coins per block, approximately every minute. Not one Doge more, not one less.\n\nAnd with every single block, the inflation rate decreases slightly. Currently somewhere in the 3-4% range, which is a pretty good place to be, and less than other top tier coins.\n\nAnd this is never going to change. Because the community is smarter than the average noob who comes in here and the first thing they post is ‚Äòcap the coin!‚Äô. There is zero support for a cap, because people realise that killing mining would kill the coin. Literally make it completely worthless the moment that our hashpower dropped low enough for someone to carry out a 51% attack. After which there would be no Dogecoin. Is that what you want?\n\nYou also don‚Äôt appear to understand how prices and value work.\n\nThe value of a thing is its desirability. That special photo of some long-lost friend, event, place, etc may have irreplaceable value to you. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôd get a huge price for it if you tried to sell it.\n\nPrices are set by one thing and one thing only. Trading activity. Every time a buyer and a seller agree to a transaction, that trade sets a new price. On the exchange they‚Äôre using. And if the exchange is one of the ones tracked by the aggregators, then it will contribute towards setting a new average price as well. Which is what your charts show.\n\nThat‚Äôs it. Nothing else makes any difference whatsoever. Not the supply. Not the moonshots and tweets and billboards and race cars and everything else people think up to try and jack up prices.\n\nSo why would someone want to pay more for a thing than the current price? Good question. Probably because they need it and they don‚Äôt care about the price. Like when my mum pays $100 for a pack of cigarettes, which I think is insane. Or maybe they think the price will go higher and they can make a profit. Or maybe they have some other reason, but you‚Äôd have to ask them.\n\nOne thing is certain though‚Ä¶\n\nNo one thinks ‚Äòthere are X number of coins being minted, so I‚Äôll rush out and pay more for them‚Äô. And thinking otherwise is delusional.', 6), ('[deleted]', 1), (""You're correct about removing the fees cuz the miners don't mine for the fees anyway, but it wouldn't have any effect on the amount of DOGE created."", 1), ('They‚Äôre not wrong, but the twins are very late to the party.

Doge production is a constant rate. What he is saying is that the 5 billion per year will become a smaller percentage of the total over time because the total is growing.\n\n125 + 5 is a 4% increase.\n\nKeep adding 5 per year and in 5 years you'll have 150 total supply.\n\nAt that time, 150 + 5 is a 3.3% increase. \n\nThe percentage increase goes down a tiny amount every minute that new doge is mined."", 1), ('![gif](giphy|STfLOU6iRBRunMciZv)', 1)]"

Or talking about Doge on any social media. They are just ordinary people playing with this funny coin on some exchange or other, and they probably don‚Äôt even understand that all crypto isn‚Äôt Bitcoin.\n\nWhat does happen though is that when markets move generally, say because of a central bank raising interest rates, or some unexpected numbers from government statistics, or some real-world event like a bank collapse, the herd moves all at once in the same direction.\n\nWhich really has nothing to do with Doge as such.', 2), ('Thank you my friend. I really appreciate your efforts on the matter.', 1), ('Agree with you.', 1), ('üòé', 1), ('Doge is ready to go parabolic !', 1), ('OK, so after many false starts, I finally managed to get through it all and digest it.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nFirst up, I still think it‚Äôs off topic and should not be posted here.\n\nI feel that a number of assumptions are invalid. Starting with the americentricity, which is always toxic in a global community.\n\nBut mostly, I just completely reject the underlying premise of intelligent manipulation. I‚Äôve got enough experience in the real world to know that‚Äôs a completely false bit of misinformation.\n\nThe reality is that large systems are made up of many moving parts. There is no ubiquitous guiding hand exerting a will and forcing some kind of master plan.\n\nThe moving parts in this case are people. Each of us takes individual small actions, which add up to force multipliers to great effect.\n\nTake climate change as an example. No one set out to destroy the planet. But billions of people individually and independently made countless decisions which had that effect. From the choice of cars the size of barges to individually-wrapped pieces of fruit to the killing of plants and animals, it has always been an individual who turned the key, pulled the trigger or wielded the axe. And while some did it because someone directed them to, the overwhelming majority simply didn‚Äôt think.\n\nThat‚Äôs the real underlying problem with the world. The wilful, deliberate lack of thought given to all manner of decisions. And the manipulation of that lack of thinking by a minority who do think about things, particularly how to use people against themselves.\n\nIt‚Äôs a pervasive problem, stretching across economies, social injustices, crime and violence, substance abuses, environmental damage, and pretty much everything we do, not as a nation, but as a planet.\n\nIndividuals hold the real power in all these things. They just need to recognise it and learn how to use it.', 2), ('We will move up all when I come...you will see...I feel and believe‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è', 1), ('Indeed. Thanks for your insight into the matter. I only state things from an American standpoint as it is where I am located, and where I planned to have the message be circulated from, as I was thinking that if we can come together to help this here, the rest of the world may take notice.\n\nYou are correct in saying that it stretches even further across multiple fronts such as the ones you stated and in order for a real change to take place we have to fix ourselves as individuals on multiple points before anything can ever happen.\n\nYou are also correct in the fact that the power needed rests within each, and every, single one of us. How are we able to get people to see that this is the first step to fixing the problem though?\n\nWe are killing our planet. It\'s a true fact that some refuse to see because ""Hey it\'s not just my fault, so why should I have to change?"". Our earth has always froze to heal itself and because of the damage we have done to the planet through recent technological advances we have a very real threat of the earth not being able to freeze. And if it does not freeze to recover the damage done to its atmospheres... The earth will burn when that time comes instead.\n\nI know there are other real threats out there as well such as A.I. but if we can\'t even unify under a type of currency the entire world can use how can we ever hope to solve any of the issues humanity has on a global level? People need to believe that change is possible and that it CAN happen if we just all work together.', 1), ('I know in my heart that the change for the greater good on a global level is possible.. But the starting point is what is eluding me. If we never start we can never finish. The problem will be the problem forever. That problem is US as a species.', 1), ('I get that, but you‚Äôre not going to fix the world by starting in the US.\n\nFrankly, the American mindset is irrational. Look at the refusal to even think about doing anything to reduce the death toll from mass shootings for example. Or making the health system fairer for another example.\n\nNow, there‚Äôs a certain left/right divide to most of this. The battle between the good of all versus the advantage of the rich and powerful. But that‚Äôs not the entirety of it.\n\nWe kicked out a right wing government last year which had done untold damage over a decade. Our new government has set about generational reforms. They are attempting to change the constitution to give indigenous people a voice they‚Äôve never had. They are doubling the supply of certain drugs provided for the same subsidised fee, to name two. The right are opposing both of course. Or should I say those who currently profit from the situation are.\n\nThe problem in the US is that so much of the cultural identity is founded on the ‚Äògreed is good‚Äô model, and the opposing view has little power because of the extremely deep pockets on the right. Fortunes built on death and destruction, and tentacles that reach right across the globe. That‚Äôs not going away anytime soon. Not without massive wealth redistribution which the political system simply does not allow.\n\nLook at the four years of an orange imbecile who took the world to the brink and who is inherently dishonest to the point of facing a slew of legal actions. And yet there is a real danger of his return to power? Seriously? Such a person is not fit for power, yet the system allows sufficient manipulation to give it to him on a silver platter.\n\nBut to get back to crypto, I‚Äôm afraid that it isn‚Äôt the answer to any of this. Not only is it fundamentally incapable of replacing fiat, precisely because of the same features that make it secure and incorruptible, but even if it were possible, it would do nothing for the real issues that face us.\n\nAlso, the planet is not sentient. It doesn‚Äôt act to heal itself or anything else. It simply reacts to a multitude of inputs. Since we now control many of those inputs, we inevitably control the reactions as well. Up to a point.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at the freeze cycle for instance. The northern hemisphere is kept relatively comfortable for human life because of warm ocean currents which encircle the globe. These currents are dependent on the relative densities of part of the water column, which maintain a temperature differential. But if those densities alter, the currents will alter and can indeed stop. Many years ago, I was shown ice cores from Antarctica, where anomalies were visible from some 15,000 years ago. Analysis of the air bubbles trapped in them indicated that there had been a massive spike in greenhouse gasses over a very short span of a year or two. The explanation the scientists gave me was that melting land ice had decreased the salinity of the oceans. This allowed the masses of methane which sit trapped in the organic matter on the sea floor at the mouth of every river to bubble up to the surface and into the atmosphere. The result was almost instant, and the ocean currents stopped.\n\nThere was a recent example of this phenomenon when an African lake killed an entire community on its shores after its sediments were disturbed by tremors. Everyone died in their sleep, without warning.\n\nNow, we can continue to ignore these things. We can continue to allow vested interests to make money off activities which put the world at risk. We can continue to elect people who are bought and sold by the rich and powerful. And we will suffer the consequences as the changes become irreversible.\n\nThe world cannot be destroyed. Not until it‚Äôs ultimate end in three billion years anyway. Life cannot be destroyed either. We‚Äôve had seven extinction events which killed almost all life, and the ecosystem recovered after each. It will again. But we may not be around to see it.\n\nAnd there‚Äôs the real issue. Do we care more about our continued existence and relative comfort, or do we sell our souls and our future for greed, money and power?', 2), ('But if not the U.S, Where?\nThe start always has to happen somewhere.\nEvery single person on this planet is capable of great things. We have been taught in our schools that self love isn\'t important and that we must spend all our time focusing on school, work, bills, and things of that nature. When what should be being taught is Joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, faith, and trust.\n\nTo think that we can just scoot by and not have to worry about the current state of things because it\'s just going to end up being the next persons problem is the reason the world is the way it is.\nWe are too busy sitting back and watching the world destroy itself to think ""Hey, Maybe we should do something about this.""\nI do agree that maybe crypto isn\'t the answer to solve the first issue we have, But what other options do we actually have? We can go to Africa and feed and provide medical care to their people but as soon as the help leaves, so does the change that was trying to be made. The same is true for every issue we currently face. We can\'t just do something for a set period of time and call it good... It is a continuous effort that needs to be applied throughout the rest of time.\n\nThere is some very ancient scripts and knowledge, some of which the Bible shamlessly plagiarized, that speaks of the exact issues currently going on in the world and says that the time of the web of interconnectivity of knowledge the planet will eventually have will be the time for change. If it is not me who follows through and kicks this whole thing off, It is just going to be someone else somewhere farther down the line when things are even worse.\n\nI have an intense love for each and every single person on this planet regardless of who they are and wether or not I ever meet them, because I know the change we require needs unity among the mass that is humanity.\n\nIf we don\'t start now, That is simply just time wasted. You may not believe in me, But I believe in me, and that\'s enough for me to try my hardest to make a positive impact on this world. Cryptocurrency or not.', 1), ('Europe has already started, and has made many improvements in recent years.\n\nBut the obvious starting place is India. It is now the most populous nation on earth, and unlike China, it is a democracy. And it is intent on improving the lives of all its people. Improvements which must come without the negative impacts western consumer societies have imposed on the planet. And there is plenty of scope, especially around energy and agriculture.\n\nThis is not to say that the US or any other nation can simply sit by and do nothing of course. But the likelihood of major systemic change is low, simply because of the vested self-interests opposing it.\n\nIndividual action can of course bring about change. If everyone stops buying guns, suddenly the gun lobby loses its power. If everyone stops buying monster trucks, there goes much of the influence of the oil industry. Put solar panels on every house, and the coal industry disappears. And so on and so forth.\n\nBut good luck convincing people to change their ways.', 1), ('Thank you for your time. You are an extremely intellectual individual and I highly value your knowledge regarding the subject I brought to your attention and are in fact the only one that was willing to see and speak upon the post. You have allowed me to make more sense of the message I am trying to relay to the world.\nThe things you just stated are baby steps that need to first be realized and taken into account before anything will ever happen. As such, I have noted them in my journal for use at a further time. I may even contact you further in the future for more guidance if I am able and you are willing.\n\nMay eternal sunshine bless your light with love dear friend. Thank you again, for your wisdom~', 1), ('Thank you. I‚Äôm always willing to discuss most topics, so by all means reach out if you wish. üëç', 2), (""You don't think increased social media presence affects price, or people start posting more on social media if price moves?"", 0), ('Nope.', 2), ('[removed]', 0)]"
Significantly increase the faucet payout (Bag of Doge)!,"In case you missed my post [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1370x1c/relaunching_free_doge_faucet_bagofdogecom/), I recently relaunched [Bag of Doge](https://bagofdoge.com) (but only the faucet part). If you're not aware, a faucet is a way to help new shibes out by giving a few doges to get started.

Anyways, I decided the increase it to output on average 0.01 doge. Since a payout requires 0.1 doge (because of transaction fees), you can easily get a payout in a single day.

There's no catch, no account creation necessary! You just need to provide a Dogecoin address and that's it! I put ads on the website to help keep the lights on, but that's it :) If you're feeling generous, feel free to contribute to the faucet, 100% of the funds will be used for the faucet.

It's part of the universal freedom that is to become, and unite mankind through mass utilization of only the strongest positive emotions. That's a lot right? Never forget that unlimited supply = unlimited demand. That's no different from what anyone has going on right now honestly.

So proud of you all! Keep on hodling.

As the % of the supply increases as at lower and lower rate every year the natural process of inflation will cause the price of doge to increase relative to other currency. The only ways to prevent this is:  \nA. fiat currency starts to deflate (something that hasn't happened in for significant periods of time in America since the 1930s)  \nB. people stop using doge as a means of exchanging value. This can only happen if we give up on it. If we let bad actors taint the message to their own ends. Promote good and keep fighting for usage.  \n\n\nRight now the math says doge=1$ around 2029-2030 though multiple factors can effect that.  \n\n\nThat said that's an increase of 1150% in 7 years. Since the investment market average is to shoot 8-12% I'd say its a good investment."", 2), ('Short answer: Maybe\n\nLonger answer: Possibly', 8), ('Thank you so much for explaining and giving hope ü§ó', 0), ('I hope it goes up soon', 0), ('[removed]', 0), ('They are literally telling you the opposite of the facts lol.\n\nPrinting new coins is inflationary, doge is inflationary...\n\nThey are also telling you fiat tends to deflate.... when is the last time you heard of the dollar deflating?\n\nThey are either messing with you, or they only have 2 operating brain cells.', 2), ('Deflationary in that it has a set creation amount. The supply of coins increases at a fixed rate; and cant be changed. As time progresses the % of newly created coins to old supply become deflationary at the rate of inflation set by fiat currency.  \n\n\nI am not using correct terms from crypto communities; sorry if my language is confusing the message', 2), ('It is not deflationary in any sense of the word.\n\n&gt;Although there is no theoretical supply limit, at this rate, the number of Dogecoins put into circulation will only double in 20 years (the next doubling will occur in the year 2075). There is no implemented hard cap on the total supply of Dogecoins. Nonetheless, in February 2014, Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer announced that the limit would be removed in an effort to create a consistent reduction of its inflation rate over time.[60] In other words, the inflation rate improves over time starting at 5% in 2015 to less than 4% by 2019, 3% by 2027, and 2% by 2035.', -1), (""which in tern causes a deflationary effect when compared to the standard inflation rate  goal set by the fed comparing to the $  \n\n\nIf doge inflation is 2% over a year, and the $'s inflation is 5% over a year then the effective difference is a deflation of 3%"", 1), ('Yes', 3), ('Lol you are hopeless.

In other words the inflation-is-decreasing-with-time.  [https://i.redd.it/bp1w5u2ow4xa1.png](https://i.redd.it/bp1w5u2ow4xa1.png)\n\nWhy does doge have new issuance at all?  Because the new issuance is the reward that  miners receive for servicing the doge blockchain, processing transactions and protecting the network, while simultaneously keeping the network fees near zero. More importantly, a currency without permanent new issuance, even a modest one, will not serve successfully as a currency and have to find some other utility or die. History has seen currencies that have no inflation, and they suffer from a number of things:\n\n* substitution, in other words people start looking for other mediums of exchange\n* non-inflationary currencies have been associated with deflationary death spirals\n* currencies with no inflation start to look more and more like assets, and some things that can happen: high fees, high premiums, flattening adoption curves."", 3), ('Thank you ü§ó', 1), ('Thank you so much for your point of view ü§ó', 1), ('It would be great!!!', 2), ('I pray for it üôè', 0), (""I think that maybe if we all just say that we can't stick with it and were forced to sell our entire bag then it will go up."", 2), (""That's exactly what we don't want to do üòÇ"", 1), ('I\'m not sure.

It may be that global factors are too powerful and delay the cycle.

A closer Look at Dogecoin and it‚Äôs rivals Shiba Inu/Blaze Token.,[removed],1,0,2023-05-13 01:54:11,,dogecoin,Opinion piece,[]
"Dogecoin , pure motives and a lot of heart","It‚Äôs the bottom of the ninth, score tied, two out. Out of the dugout comes an unassuming coin who doesn‚Äôt strut, simply walks to the plate with purpose and determination. After a few practice swings, steps into the box and prepares for the first pitch. All this time there is only one thought on Doge‚Äôs mind, do it for the people, they deserve to be treated fairly, have equality in the financial system. The pitcher winds up, throws the ball and on the first pitch Dogecoin hits it out of the ballpark, winning the game.

The moral of this story is that if one has true motives, a strong safe platform, the backing of populations and a lot of luck, the little guy can win!!!

Easy ways to earn dogecoin?,"Currently I use 5 different dogecoin faucets of varying quality, one of them is quite nice and lets you do PTC ads, as well as link other accounts like loottv for more rewards.

So processes were changed to improve them.\n\nOne of the changes was to try a different undercoat. You can‚Äôt print on plastic, so you need to put the base coat down to enable that. And they needed a way to tell the difference, and to have the automatic sorters pull the test notes out for examination.\n\nAussie Banknotes use a 4-character prefix followed by the serial number. The prefix denominates the position on the sheet and the year. But they don‚Äôt use the whole alphabet. So the first prefix is AA96 for 1996, but they only go to AM96 with the next one being BA96 and so on. The last prefix for the normal notes was JK96.\n\nSo the test notes were given prefixes from AN to AZ, etc. The actual prefixes issued were AN96 to CS96. But then they discovered a problem with this plan.\n\nUnlike the smaller denominations, $100‚Äôs don‚Äôt really circulate. They sit in bank vaults and safes for many years, and therefore they were unable to gather the test results they were after. So the following year, they printed 9,771 sheets of $5 notes in the range AN97 to DN97. These changed hands far more often, and wore out in about six months, making them very rare and valuable now.\n\nThe $100s are relatively easier to find in good condition, even all these years later.\n\nAnd if you‚Äôve read this far, you now know far more than you ever expected to learn here. üòé', 3), ('So, I‚Äôve read the whole thread, but I still don‚Äôt get the logic behind this excercise.\n\nWhy would you burn two sets of fees and go to all this trouble when you could simply send 100 Doge from one wallet to another?

I lacked knowledge and was still in the process of learning.\n\nOne thing that has become clear to me is that many of us in the cryptoverse use the phrase ""to the moon"" to describe reaching a certain price target, without necessarily considering the real-life benefits of the underlying technology. However, there are others who are genuinely interested in the potential utility of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I realize that this might sound na√Øve, but similar skepticism was expressed about the internet in its early days.\n\nThe most important thing is to be willing to risk only what you can afford to lose. In my case, I took a greater risk than I ever could have imagined because I lacked education and understanding.', 2), ('I wish it could be in 2023.', 3), ('[removed]', 1)]"

NFTs are a joke.... so they should be on Dogecoin!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7b6zzbjfgk0b1.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc882c4e2250f664ebee298eab74f3edb4234d8

Hello everyone! 

I am a guy from Germany that spent more time than he likes to admit on an NFT-Protocol for the Dogecoin Blockchain. And since everything seems to be working great it's finally time to at least tease the idea of NFTs on the Dogecoin blockchain.

That being said, I know that NFTs are a disputed topic and probably not everyone wants to see them on Dogecoin...

Therefore I will at first only release my own NFT-Collection (see details below) before setting up an environment in which everybody can deploy their own NFT-contracts on the dogecoin blockchain.

This will remove the risk of network congestion and will give enough time to analyze the effectiveness and security of the protocol before releasing it into the wild.

&amp;#x200B;

The Dogecoin NFT Protocol only uses regular Dogecoin transactions. 

So unlike Smart Contracts it isn't something directly integrated into the blockchain but instead acts as a layer on top of Dogecoin.

More details about the implementation will follow soon. Probably at first in the form of a video since I feel it will be easier to explain stuff that way.

A Whitepaper would likely follow after that.

&amp;#x200B;

The protocol currently supports the following functionality:

* creation of ""dumb contracts""
* add/update contract metadata
* add/remove contract owners
* mint/burn/transfer/sell/buy NFTs

&amp;#x200B;

My own NFT collection is a trading card game based around a fictional war between all cryptocurrencies called ""The Crypto Conflict"".

You can use your NFTs to virtually support and attack cryptocurrencies. 

Supporting a currency with your cards will increase its military power while attacking will reduce its military power.

There is a leaderboard on the homepage that will always display which cryptocurrency currently has the most military power.

The website is already online (though only for testing purposes) at [www.cryptoconflict.net](https://www.cryptoconflict.net)

There you can also view all of the 52 cards that will be available at launch.

Each card has a (hopefully) funny design and flavor text about cryptocurrency or trading related terminology. The card images were drawn by [graphyjeffy](https://www.fiverr.com/graphyjeffy) on fiverr.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I writing this here?

* I am looking for beta testers, especially people that would be willing to download dogecoin core and the whole dogecoin testnet blockchain. (They could then test each function themselves).
* I would really like to hear some feedback both about NFTs on Dogecoin in general and about my own NFT collection.
* Advertisement  :D

"In light of the ledger stuff, I'll eventually move some of my doge to a paper wallet.","I'll be keeping my ledgers though, and treating them as warm wallets.  Neither hot nor cold.  In light of ledger's unintended reminder that trust is not an absolute, I've concluded that there is no such thing as a cold wallet. Moving to other so called hardware wallets isn't the answer for me, as they all require firmware.  There's no pragmatic instance of a 100% hardware solution in the case of hardware wallets. They're just small computers, their hard drives are just non-volatile memory, and their software is in large part, the firmware.

I like Fulvio's overall paper wallet approach, I've used it in the past.  Time to revisit.  But I'll use an air-gapped linux instance with dogecoin-core to generate private keys and addresses, to be saved to an encrypted thumb drive. I'll keep a thumb drive setup for running a node when I need it. I'll sync it once a quarter so it won't be that far behind at any given moment, and sync of course when I need to use it.

But that has it's own issues of course. People just need to do some thinking and figure out what's best for them.  There's no perfect recipe.  I'll of course use some form of hot wallets for various things, just like I use sodogetip hot wallet for small tipping amounts.

Clarifying my previous post about Dogecoin and New York,"in 2014 I bought about $500usd in Dogecoin and have it stored safely in a paper wallet.  I love dogecoin and am 99% a HODL'er. 

For the last couple years I have decided to use some of the dogecoin to buy gold and silver coins - just to spread what I have and to get some precious metals. Using JM Bullion, I made several purchases using Bitpay and everything was fine but then NYS decided to 'protect' me by banning dogecoin (crypto) transactions with these services.  I know I can use the doge one on one but what companies allow purchases for precious metals while living in this WONDERFUL state of new york?  What are my options to buy precious metals?  I only want to use my doge to purchase silver and gold.   


Someone mentioned bitrefill - I guess that might be an option

What are doginals? How DRC-20 is changing the cryptocurrency landscape.,"Hello everyone, I'm doog and I run The Bone. I know many of us are still in the dark as to what doginals and DRC-20 really is, so I thought I would make a short post on where this stuff came from.

https://preview.redd.it/r6r6vacb3o3b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c4e7b61ddd3ca549ed080bb853a6fc5d7d8c35

# What are doginals? An introduction to DRC-20.

Doginals - a word you may have heard recently, but what are they really? Where did they come from and *why* did they come about? I'm here to help break that down, but first, to understand Doginals, we first need to take a short look at their cousin, Ordinals.

Ordinals have become a popular trend in the Bitcoin community as of late. Similar to NFTs, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets inscribed onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. This became possible through Casey Rodarmor‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrdinal Theory‚Äù, which created a system for individualizing satoshis and giving them unique identities.

Similar to how Ordinals inscribe information onto the smallest units of a Bitcoin, Doginals inscribe information onto the smallest units of Dogecoin, named *shibes*.

You see, each shibe can store a very tiny amount of information via a process we call ‚Äúinscribing‚Äù. By keeping track every shibe in circulation, a normally fungible token like $DOGE can be inscribed with data, tracked, and transferred amongst collectors, speculators, and enthusiasts.

## How the heck is any of this done?

By using a tool called an indexer, which is just a fancy word for a platform that acts as a ledger for all of the data being written onto every single shibe in existence. Armed with an indexer, users can now create token and image collections on blockchains that wouldn‚Äôt normally have the capacity to natively map this type of information.

Plain and simple: Doginals came about as a spin on Bitcoin‚Äôs Ordinals. Because Dogecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, they both have the capability to utilize Ordinal Theory. Amongst the hype of Bitcoin‚Äôs Ordinals spawned a handful of other mirrored systems, including Doginals on Dogecoin and Litecoin Ordinals on, uh, Litecoin.

## So how did Doginals specifically come about?

In February 2023, a developer named ""Apezord"" introduced the Doginal standard by launching the first Shibescription (shown below).  


[Shibescription 0](https://preview.redd.it/hl3gd7jp3o3b1.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e753ce2eaf25e92cbdd9ea415c19366e584ea090)

This sparked the formation of a community where numerous Shibescriptions were created, ranging from texts to images to even gifs. During this time, someone also introduced the inaugural DRC-20 token, $DOGI, with a maximum supply of 21 million ‚Äútokens‚Äù.

Progress in the DRC-20 space has faced its fair share of obstacles, mainly due to the challenges posed by Dogecoin's random block rewards (that‚Äôs a topic for another day). Projects have thus far faced difficulties in establishing a reliable indexing infrastructure which means sometimes your collection would be recognized as one thing in one place, and entirely different attributes in another.

But, despite this, leaps are being made within the doginals community, and DRC-20 trading has been off the charts.

On May 22nd, transactions on $DOGE skyrocketed, marking a new all time high of over 719,000. For reference, Bitcoin‚Äôs transactions for the day - in the midst of Ordinals season still, mind you - was 566,000.

Similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs Ordinals, Doginals began to rapidly gain interest from the wider cryptocurrency community. The low fee structure of Dogecoin allowed many participants to begin minting all sorts of DRC-20s without too much overhead or risk.

Plus, you know, being early to the next new thing in crypto never *hurt*.

## Not Everything that glitters is gold.

Doginals have not been without their challenges, however - and there‚Äôs been contention both inside and outside of the community when it comes to DRC-20.

For example, one Dogecoin core developer [*voiced*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RlY3J5cHQuY28vMTQwNDY4L2RvZ2Vjb2luLWFjdGl2aXR5LXN1cmdlcy13aXRoLW9yZGluYWxzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dGhlYm9uZS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj13aGF0LWFyZS1kb2dpbmFscyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI2Y2JjNGExMy00N2EwLTRjODQtOGY3Ny0yYzkwZjBkNDJlZWMiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImQ4NTg3MWZhLTlmOTEtNDhmZC1iM2Y3LTBiMjA1OGFkMWNiYyIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiM2ZkZDBiODctYmJiNS00YWQ3LTlmY2YtYjU1ODJiNjU3ZTNhIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg1NzMyOTEzLjIxOSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.HJTTwPf11u8QltVVVMPT8cQxvR9-4dogxdIFnQ9Uzwg) his skepticism, saying:

*‚ÄúSomething like this cannot become a real ‚Äòfeature‚Äô because it has not had enough thought given to it‚Ä¶ Sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly.‚Äù* \-Patrick Lodder

Coincidentally enough, a similar sentiment was shared by Luke Dashjr, one of the leading Bitcoin Core developers, in relation to BRC-20. He went so far as to say that immediate action needed to be taken to stop the Ordinals trend.

If you‚Äôve attempted to transact with Bitcoin recently, you may have noticed the elaborately high fees. In case you need a quick refresher, as competition for block space increases, so does the cost to transact on the network.

Case-in-point: Dogecoin network‚Äôs transaction fees increased three-fold between May 10th and May 22nd. Thankfully, the fees are still relatively cheap due to the nature of Dogecoin‚Äôs blockchain, but you get the picture.

## What‚Äôs Next?

That‚Äôs the million dollar question now isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm afraid the only answer I can confidently say is: Who knows?

Ordinals are still new enough that we‚Äôre seeing exorbitant volume on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, so we don‚Äôt even have much to compare the current state of affairs to.

Maybe doginals will fade away into the annuls of crypto history. Or maybe, just maybe, DRC-20 is the next evolution of $DOGE history. But, for a chain built on community, memes, and having fun, some might say doginals is just what the shibe ordered.",5,15,2023-06-02 20:52:46,,dogecoin,Educational,"[('WARNING. NEW ACCOUNT DETECTED.

Dogecoin is not a security,"Dogecoin is about to shake things up like never before. While other cryptocurrencies have faced scrutiny from the SEC and been labeled as unregistered securities, Dogecoin clearly not a security this is a positive. 

Dogecoin‚Äôs unique status as a non-security is about to send shockwaves through the market. In the next bull run, I predict with utmost confidence that Dogecoin will claim a spot among the top three coins, plus a new 

The recent regulatory changes have opened up a world of opportunities for Dogecoin, igniting a fierce rally in its value. The impact could be so monumental that Dogecoin may surpass the $1 mark, reaching maybe even $2. A lot of the cash from the selling of the crypto marked as securities will flow into Doge.

Also, I think Ethereum is one of the few DEFI projects that's legitimately decentralized.\n\nMy 2 cents:  Everything else is potentially a security, everything else is heavily CEFI.  There are \\~30,000 different cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, etc.  Just a few years ago less than a 100.\n\nI think DEFI/CEFI will survive, but undergo a massive cleansing. Till then my opinion of DEFI/CEFI in general is negative. I think today there's 30,000 cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, and in the near future, most will be zombies or dead.\n\nThe entire point of crypto was to return a modicum of power to the people. I think the only ones that authentically pursue that in technical terms, as well as social structural terms, are Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.  With the exception of Ethereum, I think most DEFI/CEFI fails miserably at giving some power back to the people.\n\nI also believe, that most DEFI is fake.  It's either strait up CEFI, or a 90%/10% CEFI/DEFI blend.  This fake DEFI, and CEFI are responsible for some of the largest financial losses in history. The likes of FTX ,BlockFI, Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows, UST, Terra/Luna, Safemoon, and hundreds, maybe thousands of DEFI/CEFI hacks and thefts. (see [rekt.news](https://rekt.news))\n\nIt's like people want to take all the horrible stuff of the banking industry, and re-implement in the crypto space, and combine it with shyster business scams of the 1950s...  Debt, leverage, margin, rewards, interest, earn, staking, derivatives, tokens, centralized leadership , fake whitepapers, fake utility, airdrops, nfts, and countless other ploys, all recycled ideas from the banking industry and bussiness grifters.  Makes legitimate institutions/banks/creditunions/businesses look bad.\n\nDogecoin is a breath of fresh air.  A true asset, and unofficial digital currency.\n\nOf course people need to realize that global factors, and their own personal timing/luck, as well as there being no guarantees, plays a big part in the success or failure, of one's investments.\n\nDon't rely on a time frame for gains, because that's how you get roasted.  Never invest what you can't afford to ignore for years and years.  I expect dogecoin to continue succeeding, but I know that it may not.  Or it may succeed wildly, but maybe the next cycle isn't till 2026.  I have no idea.

Why $1 is possible and probable,"The purpose of this post is to post relationships of doge relative to if countries, businesses, people provided below. This is intended for these wild what if scenarios purely to value if statements 

The global ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of currency is $83,000,000,000,000 (83 trillion dollars) in the world wide. There is only 139,742,006,383.71 DOGE (139 billion)

On May 8, 2021, Dogecoin briefly reached its highest market capitalization of $88.8 Billion with a price of $0.6818 per Dogecoin. 

Let‚Äôs assume these far off scenarios take place at the same day and time to make math simpler. Or in other words maintaining the same circulating supply. 

88,800,000,000 = $.6818 
For similar math let‚Äôs us 88.8 trillion as world currency 
88,800,000,000,000 = $681.8 per doge 

If 10% of worlds supply is invested/utilizing doge for its cheap transactions 

8,800,000,000,000 = $68.18 per doge

The us has $2,344,000,000,000 dollars (ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) (2.34 trillion) 
 
This is roughly 1 doge being equivalent to $18.16 usd 

If 10% of the USD was invested in doge it would be $1.816

China has 10.47 trillion yuan in circulation at the end of 2022. That‚Äôs 1,465,237,342,200 usd. If all Yuan was doge. 1 Doge would be 11.35 usd. 10% is 1.35. 

If 10 percent of us and china invested in doge. $1 doge would be $3.16 usd. 

Tesla is $789 billion dollars. 789,000,000,000 almost 10x doge at its peak. Almost $6.81

Amazons 978 billion. As of June 2023 Apple has a market cap of $2.890 Trillion. 

I don‚Äôt even know how this is possible but As of April 2023, the total market capitalization of domestic companies listed on stock exchanges worldwide recorded as 108.23 trillion U.S. dollars. If all of that was put into doge. One doge would be $830.81.

"Not a financial expert, but some advice that helped me","Is see a lot of people talking about the dip, and asking when the price will surge again. Whether they should Hodl, buy more, or sell. 

Ultimately it will be based on the person themselves. Where I‚Äôm at right now I feel I would feel more upset if I sold everything and the price skyrocketed in an amount that would help me than if I were to lose it all in a Dogecoin crash. 

Because of this I will pop on Reddit everyone now and then to see if there‚Äôs any news, but I do my best not to obsessively watch Dogecoin price and my earning. It creates far too much stress and gives me an unrealistic expectation for it. 

As others have said here, it may take years before it hits a high prices IF it even does. It‚Äôs best to not only have a diverse portfolio, only invest what you‚Äôre comfortable losing, and keep expectations realistic. Would it be amazing if Dogecoin hit $10 this year? Absolutely.

Nearly a decade of dogecoin and why I'm still (mostly) hodling,"9 years ago someone from some sketchy forum sold me 20k dogecoin for $10 via paypal - Today those 20k dogecoins are worth around $1200usd. I have accumulated enough doge that I feel that I am comfortable with the amount and am already happy with the amount they are worth today in USD.   It took years of believing, forgetting, learning, questioning and deciding that I'm going to mostly be a HODLer.  

For YEARS my doge was worth like $.0025 and I remember I almost cashed the entire amount out for $900usd. but thankfully got lazy and forgot about it.....then one day.....bam.  It's worth a PENNY! We are now 6x that amount and people are complaining‚Ä¶..I get it - you bought when it was higher but just HODL - it will work out soon

I have cashed out enough to furnish my entire podcasting setup - new mics, rodecaster pro 2, Mac, monitors, etc etc.  - I also used a bit in the days of $.40 to buy a 1972 VW Beetle. 

Without Dogecoin I wouldn‚Äôt have made these purchases as easily. My friends ask me why I don't just 'cash out' and the only answer I can give is, I believe dogecoin will make me rich, I mean, It already made the best profit I have ever made and dogecoin has never let me down.

I believe in dogecoin as a long term hodler",77,22,2023-06-19 15:17:34,,dogecoin,Opinion piece,"[('Fellow shibe,   \nI cannot say anything other than that I agree.', 16), ('[removed]', 1), ('[removed]', 1), ('![gif](giphy|XFjx65JBWwUfrsraGQ|downsized)', 8), ('![gif](giphy|ihVKUHerDiWKvcPHak|downsized)', 4), ('Is it a 72 super beetle ?

Need Help With Old Wallets Multidoge,"I remember back in 2014 I used Guiminer and mined some dogecoin in some sort of pool. This reflects In my multidoge log file, I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether or not I got any doge added to my account from this pool, and I have no idea what to take away from the log to try and figure it out. 

Ik this is vague as hell but if someone could help look through my logs and whatnot and perhaps help I‚Äôll compensate if any doge is found. I checked the wallets that were connected to the pool and they had no transactions so I‚Äôm not sure if i just didn‚Äôt get paid for the mining or what lol",9,2,2023-06-19 20:00:07,,dogecoin,,"[('I believe it was rapidhash', 1), ('First up, using ‚Äòlite‚Äô clients for high transaction purposes like faucets or mining was a very, very bad idea. Because those clients choke on anything more than 50 UTXOs. The coins would become basically unspendable and a nightmare to fix.\n\nSecondly, all pools had/have a payout threshold. Which you could set within limits. They also encourage you to not leave coins in their wallets. If you had a high threshold and didn‚Äôt reach it, there is a pretty good chance the coins are gone depending on what happened to the pool.\n\nBe aware that Doge mining is dead. Since AuxPoW, all our mining is done by Litecoin pools, and they mostly pay out in LTC. When we switched, all the doge pools died, and their wallets died with them.\n\nSo, what I would do is this‚Ä¶\n\nStart with your MD client. You should be able to export your keys, but make sure you do it in plain text, not the default encrypted file. Once you‚Äôve done that, you have text wallets. Which as I‚Äôve been preaching for nine years now, is the only truly secure offline cold storage. Search for ‚Äòtext wallet‚Äô and have a read.\n\nThen look up your wallets on bitinfocharts. Whatever it says they contain is what you‚Äôve got. Take note of any outgoing transactions, and also the UTXO counts. Scripts such as coinb.in (which you should download and run locally offline, because you never want to expose your keys to the internet) also have limits, generally 100 UTXOs. If you have wallets with more than this (one guy had 36,000 UTXOs in MD back in the day!), you need to consolidate coins in batches. Since coinb.in will happily let you send coins back into the source wallet, this isn‚Äôt hugely onerous, but can be tedious. And comparatively expensive, even with the current low fees.\n\nHope this helps, and sorry for any losses you may have suffered.', 1)]"

The major inhibiting problem, however, is that crypto is so new. It\'s hard to pull from historical data to develop accurate tools that will work on future pretense.\n\nThe only current T.I. that I see use for in the trading area as of right now is unique.

I\'m not sure... What\'s yours?

&amp;#x200B;",2,4,2023-06-26 09:29:05,,dogecoin,,"[(""I think I've heard of an issue when juggling multiple wallet.dat files (especially the same wallet.dat file but from different backups of different times/dates).\n\nI think this is compounded by doing a lot of transactions.\n\nYour wallet.dat is a collection of addresses and private keys.  You could end up with some later versions of a wallet.dat file that don't have the same keys as a previous version had.\n\nYou need to research this pretty well, and make copies of all your current wallet.dat files before trying anything.  Label them well, so you can differentiate them.\n\nI would be inclined to use the command line to dump all private keys from every wallet.dat, then import them to a single one.  But I could be wrong.\n\nFulvio may have a better idea.  u/Fulvio55 thoughts?"", 2), ('Well, not quite.\n\nWhen launched for the first time, Core/QT generates a hundred wallets and sticks them in the wallet.dat (note that the wallets ARE the keys, and the addresses are derived from them, not something separate).\n\nIt then hands you one to use. Then every time you ask for another, or every time you spend coins, it picks another from its pool to use. And if it runs out, then it generates another hundred.\n\nSo all backups will contain the same wallets, but they won‚Äôt be marked as used in earlier copies. This is why it‚Äôs critical to backup after every spend. Because people who don‚Äôt manage their own wallets will be unaware of how things work, and that all their coins may well be in a change wallet they don‚Äôt know about. People have lost millions by failing to follow this advice.\n\nUsing DUMPWALLET to export the wallets and then throwing Core away is absolutely my advice for everyone. Because it forces you to actually think about what you‚Äôre doing and to learn to manage your wallets yourself.\n\nWhere the UTXO count comes in is that every client has a limit of how many it can handle. For ‚Äòlite‚Äô clients it is generally 50. For Core its 600. And for most everything else, including online services and scripts such as coinb.in its 100. Therefore it pays to keep an eye on it and to consolidate.coins so as to keep the count below 100. And it‚Äôs also good for the network as well, since they take up RAM space in the mempool on every node, which is a much more limited resource than disk space for the blockchain.', 1), ('See my answer to /u/terran777 below.\n\nAlso, search here for ‚Äòtext wallet‚Äô and have a read.\n\nAnd absolutely stop using Core, or any other client. You don‚Äôt need it, and you can keep as many wallets as you could possibly desire in a plain ordinary text file on removable media. That gives you secure cold storage, and grabbing a copy of coinb.in gives you a way to spend coins from any wallet without exposing your keys to the internet.', 1), ('My problem is solved, the lost coin is back.
