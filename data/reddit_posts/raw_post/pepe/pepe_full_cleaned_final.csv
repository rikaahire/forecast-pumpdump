"PEPE Meme Coin Rises Over 1,000% in 2 Days","It's that time of year again! Meme coin investors saw another coin register massive gains in a short period of time. PEPE, a meme coin that is based on the infamous pepe frog meme grew rapidly in popularity and hit new all-time high after all-time high. Here is the chart over the last few days: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ft6hPsUXwAQPfNR?format=jpg&name=small Chart analysis: https://mobile.twitter.com/0xWilli/status/1647787443184123905/photo/1 The meme coin had started out the weekend with 10 zeroes in its price but by morning, it had been able to erase three zeroes from its price. In the course of this rally, the meme coin grew over 1,000% as its popularity spread across crypto Twitter. During this time, its holder base grew from just a few hundred to almost 6,000. PEPE was also listed on Coinmarketcap in the early hours of Monday, another move that saw its price rally once more. Its trading volume also rose rapidly and has now crossed $35 million in a 24-hour period. Some people got insanely lucky and managed to trade the move. https://twitter.com/DannyCrypt/status/1647842574273478656?s=20 With one guy supposedly making $100k from $40. https://mobile.twitter.com/KalleTrades/status/1647955160642236417/photo/1 But its not to late for you fellow degenrates as Mexc has listed PEPE and you can have fun trading it at 100x leverage!

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

PEPE mooning + Meme coins - Exceed Caution,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my thoughts on the recent surge in popularity of meme coins, particularly PEPE. While it's exciting to see a coin go to the moon, it's important to exercise caution and do your due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. Meme coins like PEPE may seem fun and exciting, but they often lack the fundamentals that make a solid investment. They're typically created as a joke and don't have a real use case or value proposition. Instead, their value is largely driven by hype and speculation. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't invest in meme coins if that's what you're into. Just be aware of the risks involved and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. And always remember to do your own research and make informed decisions. So, if you're considering investing in PEPE or any other meme coin, make sure you understand what you're getting into.

While it's exciting to see a coin go to the moon, it's important to exercise caution and do your due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. Meme coins like PEPE may seem fun and exciting, but they often lack the fundamentals that make a solid investment. They're typically created as a joke and don't have a real use case or value proposition. Instead, their value is largely driven by hype and speculation. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't invest in meme coins if that's what you're into. Just be aware of the risks involved and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. And always remember to do your own research and make informed decisions. So, if you're considering investing in PEPE or any other meme coin, make sure you understand what you're getting into. And remember, while it's fun to ride the hype train, it's important to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away by FOMO."

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining.""

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary. > > So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good?

One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said: > > The Energy Fud Was Killed > The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed. > Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers. > There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector. > > [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/) > > &#x200B; > > # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug. > > &#x200B; > > Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights.

This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile. > Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear. > Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose.

Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile. > There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people.

"Crypto Pragmatist: A bug, not a feature","Jack Niewold Founder, [Crypto Pragmatist](https://cryptopragmatist.com/) April 20, 2023 About a week ago, I came across a new fundraising announcement today for a new crypto project. The project, led by a pseudonymous trader, had raised over $1m to build out a product based on what I think would be merely a feature in other industries. There's no TAM, no true differentiator. ByBit or Binance could ship the same project as a small feature in a matter of weeks. And, to be fair, even that million dollar round is relatively small as far DeFi goes. There are even crazier fundraising round for teams that I feel are building relatively simple features instead of companies and And these founders and teams doing pretty well for themselves: paying teams of engineers salaries that would be unheard of in most countries, renting offices in the most expensive places in the world, buying themselves Macbook Pros and flying around the world to crypto conferences. I'm not knocking that project itself; building and experimenting in crypto is important. This is just how the game works, and the VCs, founders, employees, angel investors, even retail investors. We're all just playing the game. So what's the problem? Well, I'd argue that the problem is that the current paradigm in crypto is a great pressure for teams to create tokens over legitimately sustainable businesses. And I think there's a specific reason for this: the whacky liquidity cycle in crypto. https://preview.redd.it/0qokd8dd45va1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=88bd2a5b85b873ecc00ff189a4e6051843346b64 Let me outline it here: It's incredibly easy for teams to launch a token Investors want tokens they can speculate on more than actual products Tokens are more successful based on narrative than actual business success Teams and VCs focus on products that can launch a token over sustainable businesses Teams focus on tokens and tokenomics over products and business models Fewer sustainable projects and businesses get built in crypto Crypto's Dilemma Let's say you're a rational investor or builder: the average time for a company to IPO is 8 to 10 years.

The project, led by a pseudonymous trader, had raised over $1m to build out a product based on what I think would be merely a feature in other industries. There's no TAM, no true differentiator. ByBit or Binance could ship the same project as a small feature in a matter of weeks. And, to be fair, even that million dollar round is relatively small as far DeFi goes. There are even crazier fundraising round for teams that I feel are building relatively simple features instead of companies and And these founders and teams doing pretty well for themselves: paying teams of engineers salaries that would be unheard of in most countries, renting offices in the most expensive places in the world, buying themselves Macbook Pros and flying around the world to crypto conferences. I'm not knocking that project itself; building and experimenting in crypto is important. This is just how the game works, and the VCs, founders, employees, angel investors, even retail investors. We're all just playing the game. So what's the problem? Well, I'd argue that the problem is that the current paradigm in crypto is a great pressure for teams to create tokens over legitimately sustainable businesses. And I think there's a specific reason for this: the whacky liquidity cycle in crypto. https://preview.redd.it/0qokd8dd45va1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=88bd2a5b85b873ecc00ff189a4e6051843346b64 Let me outline it here: It's incredibly easy for teams to launch a token Investors want tokens they can speculate on more than actual products Tokens are more successful based on narrative than actual business success Teams and VCs focus on products that can launch a token over sustainable businesses Teams focus on tokens and tokenomics over products and business models Fewer sustainable projects and businesses get built in crypto Crypto's Dilemma Let's say you're a rational investor or builder: the average time for a company to IPO is 8 to 10 years. That's a long time: Ethereum is barely 10 years old. But most major coins wouldn't have made it: Uniswap is just five years old, Binance Coin and Chainlink are both about six years old.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM) Fortunately, the guest in the bottom right had the sense to discourage investing in the token, saying it wasn't in her wheelhouse, and wouldn't be participating.

Personally, I aped a little into this early in the week and have had some pretty incredible gains - I've now taken profit and left my initial to ride the wave of shit. By the time CB was shilling, it was already nearing a dump. I love meme coins, but I have 2 bull runs of experience in playing with shit. Always gamble responsibly, and always DYOR. I advise you all exercise extreme caution if the meme rally continues, with influencers ruthlessly shilling any old ass coin that runs."

STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN SHIT COINS. Simple... Also, there is a reason why people can't just 10x their money in a week. If it was easy everyone would be doing it already. If you are up in these meme coins GET OUT NOW. You will get burned. When people say put most of your money in btc/eth I always see comments below that say why? This is why! TLDR: Shitcoin gets rugged. Shit coins are bad. Stop putting money into them..."
Let's talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/) So let's talk about Doge V Shiba Inu Utility Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. On-Chain Data Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. Doge's active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba's price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

New Airdrop for ARB recipients: REKT,"This one isn't worth a whole lot right now and was dropped this afternoon (5:00 PM UTC). If you were fortunate enough to receive the ARB airdrop, your wallet address is eligible to receive the REKT airdrop. I got about 800 ARB and the REKT drop netted me about 5 dollars. However, given the success of the PEPE drop, we could get a decent multiplier with REKT. That being said I would not spend anything other than the gas (about 50 cents in ETH) to claim REKT. There is no wallet checker so I would advise moving your moons to another address if that is the one that was used to claim the ARB airdrop and / or connecting a burner address to the website before checking your eligibility.

However, it's crucial to exercise caution and do thorough research before investing your hard-earned money. Many meme coins and questionable projects have been used as cover-ups for scams, where investors lose their funds. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it's essential to research the project team, their track record, and the project's potential before investing.

"People never learn, and never will","I'm sure some of you are already familiar with it from the other post, but basically the success of the PEPE coin is currently giving birth to a lot of scammy off-shoots like BABYPEPE and others. BABYPEPE rugged yesterday and I'm sure that more will continue to rug. Even in a bear market, where arguably the only thing you need to do to have decent profits a bit further down the line is DCA into real assets, people are still looking for a get rich quick scheme. No matter how good the opportunity is (and I believe the current market will make a lot of people well off in a matter of years) people's greed demands instant x100 profits. Regulation will have to happen because scammers and idiots are just too busy getting in business together all the time. What do you think? Will people eventually be educated enough not to fall for this, or is regulation the only thing that'll put an end to the countless rugs that we keep see-ing?

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future. I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm. These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development.

Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community.

Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have supply deflation and become a positive-sum investment. > In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation. > Polygon PoS distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees. > Solana collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)]. > Cardano rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years. > Bitcoin pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

Pepe meme coin down over 16%,"The cryptocurrency market has recently been rocked by the sudden and dramatic drop of the popular Pepe Meme Coin (PEPE). The digital currency, inspired by the well-known internet meme character, has plummeted by nearly 20% overnight, leaving investors and market analysts scrambling to make sense of the rapid decline. The sudden drop in the value of Pepe Meme Coin has raised suspicions of a rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation. This article will examine these factors and discuss their potential impact on the future of PEPE and other meme coins. Rug Pull A rug pull is a type of exit scam in the cryptocurrency world where developers or project owners abruptly withdraw their funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. The rapid decline of Pepe Meme Coin's value has led to speculation that a rug pull could be responsible for the sudden drop. While it is challenging to determine whether a rug pull has occurred, investors should be cautious when investing in newer and lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as they may be more susceptible to exit scams. Bot-Pumping on r/cryptocurrency Another factor potentially contributing to the sudden decline in PEPE's value is the recent bot-pumping on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. In the past week, numerous bot accounts have been promoting Pepe Meme Coin, artificially inflating the perceived popularity and value of the digital asset. This coordinated effort to manipulate market sentiment can lead to unsustainable price increases, followed by a rapid decline when the manipulation is exposed or comes to an end. It is crucial for investors to be aware of such deceptive practices and to thoroughly research any cryptocurrency they are considering investing in. Market Manipulation The cryptocurrency market, particularly for smaller and less established tokens like Pepe Meme Coin, remains susceptible to price manipulation by large investors or ""whales."" These entities can use their substantial holdings to artificially inflate or deflate the price of a digital asset, often to their own advantage. The suddenness and severity of PEPE's drop in value raise suspicions of market manipulation. Investors should remain vigilant about the potential for manipulation in the cryptocurrency market and carefully consider the risks associated with investing in less established digital assets. Conclusion The dramatic overnight drop in Pepe Meme Coin's value serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, especially those based on memes or other ephemeral internet phenomena. The suspected rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation highlight the need for investors to stay informed, conduct thorough research, and approach the market with caution. While the future of Pepe Meme Coin and other meme-based cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the world of digital assets is as unpredictable as ever. As such, investors should be prepared for unexpected shifts in value and exercise caution when investing in lesser-known tokens.",1,1,2023-04-24 07:19:59,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Hello sleepnsquad.

Creating A Meme Coin: Jerry Springer Pepe,"As an exercise in understanding crypto more, I was thinking about building a meme coin. Of course, the important thing is to have a strong coin name.

He asks: Am I rich yet? Well, let's do the math here ... 100 BTC x 29.210,00 $ USD = 2.921.000 USD So the answer is => if u hold Christian, yes, u are rich :) I hope u did! &#x200B; [\(2\)](https://preview.redd.it/kt2r41hfjvwa1.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb9b0e3fd84cbfc9d57fca85066b36d1490c163) &#x200B; (3) Let's discuss an interesting poll. Will BTC reach 1000 USD before 2017? The majority said NO and they were right. BTC did not reach 1k before 2017. On 31. dec 2016 BTC was at 966 USD (very close).

I am also invested in crypto around 2000 bucks which are always moving when Bitcoin is moving. Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =) > > # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin > > So as the title suggests it, the recent news from Ethereum switching from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. In this write up we are not going to talk about speculation or the financial side of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment and if you want to read one, just go to past cointests. > > Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This won\'t be tackled at all as I think it deserves its own topic. > > # 1) Bitcoin: High security > > This topic has also been talked to death: Bitcoin is ultra secure thanks to its Blockchain and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM: > > &#x200B; > > >Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or ""miners,"" try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network. > > &#x200B; > > [IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security) > > Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate: > > >Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a ""proof-of-work"" (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain. > > [USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:%7E:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain) > > So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?"" > [The hashrate is near the ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:%7E:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago) > > So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so. > While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ? > > &#x200B; > > # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail. > > &#x200B; > > So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network. > Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary. > > So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now? > > &#x200B; > > # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector. > > &#x200B; > > POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said: > > The Energy Fud Was Killed > The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed. > Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers. > There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector. > > [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/) > > &#x200B; > > # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug. > > &#x200B; > > Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes.

Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country\'s economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries. > Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory-all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price."" > Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile. > Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear. > Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose.

In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073) > Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value. > Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices. Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile. > There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people. The underlying technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, and a ""decentralized network of network validators secured by a SHA-256 hashing algorithm"" is a novel concept that can be extremely difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with it.

It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high. > > # PRO\'s > > One of the OG Coins > > Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand. > > Transaction Fees and Block Time > > The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies. > > Day-Trader\'s Paradise > > Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.) > > Community Owned > > Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high. > > # PRO\'s > > One of the OG Coins > > Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand. > > Transaction Fees and Block Time > > The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies. > > Day-Trader\'s Paradise > > Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.) > > Community Owned > > Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates."" > > Sources: > > [https://dogecoin.com/](https://dogecoin.com/) > > [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y) > > [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) > > [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) > > [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) > > [https://foundation.dogecoin.com/](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) > > [https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565) * Would you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place. Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state. > > Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities.

"PEPE Security analysis using GPT4 - Unlimited token minting, user blacklisting, DDoS risk","I used GPT4 to analyze the PEPE token contract. Here is a security analysis of the given PepeToken contract: Function visibility and access control: The contract is properly making use of the onlyOwner modifier for functions that need owner access control. Additionally, the Ownable contract is imported, which manages the ownership of the contract. Reentrancy risk: The token contract does not seem to have any reentrancy risk, as it does not call external contracts in a way that allows reentrancy. Safe arithmetic operations: The contract is using Solidity version 0.8, which has built-in overflow and underflow checks. This reduces the likelihood of arithmetic errors. DOS (Denial of Service): While the contract uses the _beforeTokenTransfer() hook as necessary, it may allow a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker could create a large number of addresses and add them to the blacklist, which would slow down transactions and potentially prevent legitimate users from using the contract. To minimize this risk, consider limiting the number of addresses that can be added to the blacklist and/or implementing a mechanism for removing addresses from the blacklist. ERC20 standard compliance: The contract seems to comply with the ERC20 standard, implementing the necessary functions, events, and using the OpenZeppelin library in general, which is well-reviewed and secure. Supply control: The contract allows the owner to mint tokens, but does not include a mechanism for pausing or stopping token minting, which may pose a risk of excessive token supply. Use of blacklist: The contract includes a blacklist feature, which restricts certain addresses from sending or receiving tokens. This could be seen as a centralized mechanism, which may not align with the principles of decentralization. Consider explaining the reasoning behind this feature, and make sure it is used transparently and responsibly. Custom rules and token transfer limits: The contract includes the setRule function to modify transfer limits and enforce custom rules. This feature can be used by the contract owner to manage the maximum and minimum token holdings for addresses. While this allows for flexibility and control, it can be seen as a centralization point for the owner. Make sure to properly document the use cases and inform users about this feature to avoid any misunderstandings.

"PEPE Meme Coin Skyrockets 39,000%: Binance Listing Next? Or Just a Rug Pull Waiting to Happen?","Hold on to your memes, folks! PEPE meme coin has just hit a jaw-dropping all-time high of $0.000000816, marking a staggering 38,900% increase since its launch on April 14th. This meteoric rise has propelled PEPE into the top 125 coins by market cap. But let's take a step back and ask ourselves: why do people keep buying potential rug pulls like PEPE? The liquidity of this coin is 65 times less than its market cap, and a huge portion of the coin is held by just a few wallets. Yet, people still freaking buy it!. What's more, PEPE's 24-hour trading volume has ranked it as the 17th most traded cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. With a market cap of over $326 million in less than two weeks, PEPE is quickly closing in on fellow meme coin Floki (FLOKI). 💨 A recent Binance buyers guide has fueled speculation that the major exchange could list PEPE soon. Remember when Floki Inu's price spiked by 50% after being listed on Binance? Imagine the possibilities for PEPE! Or is it just another rug pull waiting to happen? Of course, investing in meme coins comes with its risks, as their prices are tied to online buzz and can be vulnerable to manipulation. 🌪️ But for now, PEPE has captured the internet's imagination and is setting its sights on the top 100. So, will PEPE join the ranks of meme tokens that remain permanently etched in the crypto world's consciousness? Or will it end up being another cautionary tale of a rug pull ? Only time will tell.

To Rugpull or not to Rugpull.,"First thing is there's too many shitcoins. Looking to select one that won't be a scam is a needle in a haystack. Even the scammiest of scam coins has a decent enough white paper. The only thing I can think of is that the potential for profit is exceedingly higher on a valid coin than that of a rugpull coin. Sure, you may make a decent amount on the coin you wish to release but you'd have a lot of people hating you as well as potential law suits that could make it worse. On the other side, from what we see from new meme coins like PEPE, the potential to be part of something amazing as well as profitable should be well worth the risk to do it right. So, make a small sum, or make a legacy and actually contribute to this wonderful world of Crypto. Maybe require an extensive KYC on the creator and team before a coin could be created? Have a limit of the amount of cryptos to be released per month? I hope that'd make it more competitive and cause more hurdles hopefully which could prevent scams. Have someone with extensive knowledge or a board of such people (like Vitalik) review before allowing the coin to continue? I want to make this a safer place, we can't get there if there's no trust.

"Rebutting the Argument, Moons will Never be in the top 100.","I'm posting this as a rebuttal to a popular post from four days ago, [""Why Moons will never be Top100""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12zz03g/why_moons_will_never_be_top100/). In that post Op made five arguments for why Moons would never be in the top 100, although some arguments have merit most others are bad faith arguments with no merit or validity. # Quick Reminder on Moons Op reminds everyone that Reddit has a stance Moons don't have value. Op acknowledges this is a legal argument from Reddit. Nothing else to add to this section. # Not your everyday shtcoin Ops states Moons won't pump because they aren't your everyday sh\tcoin and doesn't have any marketing. This argument ignores the fact it's probably one of the best known tokens of this SubReddit. Moon development is completely community driven, members of this community have 163 ETH in Liquidity and 1.435M Moons on SushiSwap liquidity. One of the best things about Dogecoin is the community that wanted to build and promote it. Moons have what many sh\t coins wish they had, a community that wants to see it develop.

It's actually being developed in a grassroots way. # No one cares Op states since there are over 6M members of this sub and only 200k Moon holders (3%) it's proof that no one cares about Moons. Again this is another bad faith argument, a subscriber just means an account that subscribed to a community, it doesn't take into consideration account activity on Reddit. Many of those accounts could be banned bots or old accounts that haven't signed into Reddit for years. 200K Moon Holders is a ton of people. Sh\tcoins like Pepe dream of ever reaching 10K holders. A better statistic would be sub activity which is currently \~5,000 active members on at a time. That means the amount of holders is 40x higher than the active member count, so people who are active on the sub do care. # Holder repartition is a Red Flag Op claims having Moon whales means these accounts will dump their Moons and prevent any bull run. He also then creates a hypothetical disaster with liquidity providers based off a thought experiment. Again this is a bad argument, although it is true there are big whales that could dump Moons, there are big whales in every crypto asset that could dump. The largest individual Moon holder, holds just over 1% of the total circulating supply or about 2% if you don't consider Reddits Wallets. That isn't that much for a sh\tcoin. # Usecase > Pump Op claims Moons can't pump because people got them for free. So lets talk another sh\tcoin, AiDoge is pumping with a marketcap 9x larger than Moons, and it was given to people for free. Why would you buy this sh\tcoin when you could have gotten it for free or can get it for free? Yet the price is up nearly 10X since it first started being given out. So ignoring this flawed argument let's talk about Moons. Moons act as a Proof of Engagement/Reputation. The more moons you have the larger your virtual d\\k status symbol.

Ignoring everything else positive about Moons, (Banner, Staking Rewards, most developed Reddit Community Token) people have and will buy Moons to stand out in this SubReddit.

"The truth about meme coins - by the time you hear about one, it's way too late to make money on it. The only people who make money are founders and crypto insiders. Ordinary people are there to be exit liquidity and that's it.","I see meme coins are starting to make a comeback and I want to warn all you investors out there before you get sucked into the fantasy of becoming a millionaire from $100 of meme coins. The fact about crypto in general is that 99% of the time the vast majority of money made from a token is made by the founders and other crypto insiders... I'm talking about the big returns you hear about like $100 turning into a million. Obviously us plebians can make returns by buying ETH and seeing it double over the course of years, but I know that the fantasy of taking a $100 and turning it into seven figures is incredibly alluring. What happens is that the founders and crypto insiders invest in the tokens before they start hyping them. The hyping process is there to create exit liquidity for the founders and insiders. The plebians are there to take the inevitable loss since meme coins have no real utility or value so they always crash sooner or later. Of course there have been the odd plebe here or there whose hit it big with meme coins but they are far and few between. Please please please don't fall for meme coins... Maybe we can even put them out of existence through just ignoring them. ETA: what prompted me to write this post is seeing all the posts trying to promote PEPE...like the article about someone turning $27 into a million. I can tell you for certain now that buying PEPE at this point will not give you this type of return and is highly likely to leave you with a loss. Also a small number of connected wallets hold a significant portion of the coins...lastly don't forget that meme coins are very vulnerable to rug pulls and scams.

Some blockchains make use of a Proof of Stake consensus, but Harmony employs an unique Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) system that integrates sharding and proof of stake to achieve a secure and scalable network - one that makes it a cut above the rest. Not only that, EPoS allows staking from hundreds of validators, which preempts the problem of stake centralisation. > 2. Harmony aims to be interoperable and facilitates transactions between different chains. To this end, it is making inroads. It has integrated with Chainlink since Chainlink's decentralised oracle launched on Harmony. As such, enterprises who wish to use ONE can benefit from trustworthy price feeds of off-chain data provided by Chainlink. Plus. Harmony has integrated with Band Protocol to come up with a secure blockchain for decentralised applications.

On June 23, 2022, Harmony One was hacked, with $100 million of assets on the Horizon bridge being stolen. The bridge functioned on a 2/5 multisig contract, so the hacker(s) was able to gain access to the funds by compromising the server and getting hold of these two addresses. The question begs as to why the developers chose to be negligent of ONE's security system. In an attempt to do damage control, the Harmony team offered bounties twice - $1 million the first time and $10 million the second time - in hopes that the culprit(s) would be enticed to return the stolen funds. Unfortunately, both bounties were futile. To be fair, the developers do not shirk their responsibilities as they are currently working on various plans that address about 50,000 wallets spanning across 14 assets amounting to $97.6 million. Nonetheless, this hack eroded many users' confidence in regards to the robustness of ONE's security measures. > > 2.

The only people who make money are founders and crypto insiders. Ordinary people are there to be exit liquidity and that's it. I see meme coins are starting to make a comeback and I want to warn all you investors out there before you get sucked into the fantasy of becoming a millionaire from $100 of meme coins. The fact about crypto in general is that 99% of the time the vast majority of money made from a token is made by the founders and other crypto insiders... I'm talking about the big returns you hear about like $100 turning into a million. Obviously us plebians can make returns by buying ETH and seeing it double over the course of years, but I know that the fantasy of taking a $100 and turning it into seven figures is incredibly alluring. What happens is that the founders and crypto insiders invest in the tokens before they start hyping them. The hyping process is there to create exit liquidity for the founders and insiders. The plebians are there to take the inevitable loss since meme coins have no real utility or value so they always crash sooner or later. Of course there have been the odd plebe here or there whose hit it big with meme coins but they are far and few between. Please please please don't fall for meme coins... Maybe we can even put them out of existence through just ignoring them. ETA: what prompted me to write this post is seeing all the posts trying to promote PEPE...like the article about someone turning $27 into a million. I can tell you for certain now that buying PEPE at this point will not give you this type of return and is highly likely to leave you with a loss. Also a small number of connected wallets hold a significant portion of the coins...lastly don't forget that meme coins are very vulnerable to rug pulls and scams. Security and integrity are not important to the people behind these coins."

I wanted to share my perspective after what has happened (and what is still happening) with the latest shitcoin's huge pump. Yes I am talking about PEPE. I know that each time something like this happens, where you see a random guy turning a bunch of dollars into life-changing money, It can be very tempting to fall for It and trying to find the next big coin. However be advised that we (as human beings) always tend to give a lot of importance and relevance to good and positive events, while we tend to undervaluate the bad ones. This is a very dangerous bias that is hardwired into our brains. Do not forget that for every guy that is able to turn a bunch of dollars into millions, there is a thousand of them ""losing the bet"" and some money (sometimes even huge amounts). I guess this is an advice especially for people that are new to crypto: pick a project that you believe in and invest into that. DCA, rince and repeat.

Crypto disappoints me greatly with meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even. I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with.

Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing. If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso.

How to buy a meme coin relatively early.,"Seeing some memes are flying right now (meme season?). I thought I would share a manual how to buy these relatively early. 1. Send fiat to your main CEX e.g. Binance, Coinbase. Then buy $20 of XLM. 2. Open an account on gate.io or MEXC. Use a VPN if need be. They will verify you only with you email and phone number. These are non KYC exchanges. 3. After opening. Generate an XLM address. There are two parts, the main address and memo I.d. Copy and paste these into a word document. 4. Go back to your CEX (Coinbase for example). Send only 1 dollar's worth of XLM as a test transaction by copy and pasting the address and memo Id, save the address and send it. Then open your other exchange (MEXC). See if it has arrived (usually takes 10 minutes max). 5. Send the other 19 bucks doing the same process. You have now successfully moved money on chain. 6. In Mexc, trade all your XLM to USDT first. Now you are ready to buy your meme coin by doing a USDT/BALLS (for example) trade. Why these exchanges? No KYC, they usually get these coins right after Uniswap. Can use Uniswap, but it is annoying with gas fees as they are. Why XLM? Stellar Lumens are usually the fastest and cheapest on chain. But could also do any other coin if you like. Tip: can set a stop loss too if you only want to lose half your money if it is a flop/scam. Also if it doubles (like Wojak and Pepe did for me recently). Take out your original 20 bucks and let it ride. Or even 50% up is a good idea too. I also give it a few days as well. Sometimes they need catching on. If they are trending on Coingecko and Twitter, it might still have more to run if it's a low MC.

This is just sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming shitloads of shitcoins from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich. Then I saw this: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/j4qe60angjxa1.jpg?width=1509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af44502d9554e7b3edd42558ab4d6d80a58cceb $0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers. But less than a penny? Of course, lets look at that gas fee. PEPE volume has been insane lately, so I just knew I was gonna see some pain. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/t7t6n63ogjxa1.jpg?width=1567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36846f33e7c1b0c15d8a353a044860c1684c1f3a That's right folks. Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words. Now lets have a look at this poor soul's transaction history: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/sbe6x0sogjxa1.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=074e78fc8d10ed33d5056c603ad84c8e31dc3db5 Two transactions total. Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows. At this point, it's just sad.

I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming shitloads of shitcoins from various Defi protocols.

Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words.

Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows. At this point, it's just sad.

Why the next bullrun will be different to previous ones.,"Wether you are bear or bull currently it's fair to assume that we are on our way towards another bullrun, obviously the timing of it can and will be debated infinitely on here, but we have seen a huge bear move in the crypto markets this past 12+ months and an upward swing is to be expected. Here's what I think will be significantly different about the next bull run: Alts: Time has moved on in the crypto world, people's awareness of what is and what isn't worthy of spending their hard earned cash on has evolved, Alts on the whole are dogshit, they are a moonshot and for every PEPE there are hundreds of other worthless meme coins that disappear into obscurity, these last years we have seen huge amounts of people new to the space entering via memecoins and I think the heightened publicity on just how bad these coins are will see less emphasis on this sector next bullrun, hopefully many of the worst ones will simply disappear, the entire crypto space needs to slim down in my opinion. Bluechips: Following on from the above comment I think we will see much more money flow into the top coins this time with BTC and ETH being the main targets for people looking to invest in the long run, globally people's awareness of the word ""Bitcoin"" has become synonymous with cryptocurrency and it is the first name people say when you mention crypto in my experience, so it's natural new money will gravitate towards it, it's also the ""Gold standard"" of the industry. Secondary ""decent networks"" such as, and it pains me to say some of these networks but they are current favourites, Solana/Matic/Cardano/XRP etc will also see higher flows as people are priced out of the top coins as price moves higher. The NFT world had a big impact on bringing in revenue and raising awareness to the crypto space this last 18months but again that has largely been shown to be fugazi with 99% of projects either straight rugs or slow rugs, granted the 1% that have provided value have done so in a cool manner but the rest of the space is just trying to copy the vision of projects like BAYC/Degods etc and for anyone paying attention to that space it's clear to see the cycle there mimics meme shitcoins: create hype, promise roadmap, create mint fomo, mint, sell into exit liquidity for those that got in early. I think the NFT space continues to weaken as it has exhausted the supply of willing idiots and kids with daddy's credit cards. The next bullrun will face plenty of headwind with basically the US government trying their hardest to suppress and destroy the groundswell of optimism that it could be a legitimate alternative to the failing global financial system. As always it will be down to the Hodlers to keep chipping away with accumulation of the coins that will ultimately prevail and hopefully some new, big players will emerge and not make the same mistakes as the likes of FTX and Do Kwon, but we al know greed will be the only winner and a fool and his money will always be easily parted.

A short list of crypto launch tiers and how to know whats what,"Hey, so today SUI Mainnet has launched and has been highly anticipated. As to this moment of posting, the price is still increasing, just like we witnessed with ARB weeks ago, right after it launched. I wanted to share some tipps and a small tier list, for beginners, on how to spot which launch might be shortterm profitable. Tier 1 (recent examples are SUI, ARB & OP): These coins are highly anticipated and are probably making shortterm gains. They are beeing advertised by (crypto)newssites, beeing advertised by multiple Tier 1 CEX's(f.e. Binance) and when beeing launched are probably launched on multiple CEX's at once. Almost all of them have Venture Capitalists as early bird investors. These Cryptos(mostly Coins), are either innovating something new or are advancing. Beware the gains can be only shortterm before they dump a bit and then stabilize. Tier 2 (for example CGPT/GPT, the native token to a DEX on a new blockchain, a Chiliz clubtoken, NFT-Tokens etc): These coins/tokens have a base of users for their public ICO and afterwards protocoll/blockchain, sometimes an amount of early VCs have invested in them and they have some sort of relevance which is mostly shortlived. They are a lot of times beeing launched on a single CEX or a DEX but after releasing are slowly beeing adopted by other platforms. These coins and tokens are risky because they mostly have a shortlived pump and afterwards a massive selloff before stagnating or even worse slowly declining in value over time. Day traders can make bigger amounts of gains but can loose even more aswell. Tier 3 (mostly tokens, like Pepe & Bonk) These tokens just suddenly arise and are very hard to track. There's a one in a million chance of either getting a token which makes a profit or finding something without a value. If you do find one and are early, you might become a millionaire without having to invest more then a hundred dollars. These tokens who do succeed, are in most cases not long lived either. They almost always launch on their own ico without prior funding and/or on the main DEX of their native blockchain with a soft launch. You never know which one is a scam or not. If you hear about it on a (crypto)newssite, its probably to late to invest in it. If you hear about it from your father and you haven't invested in it it is definitely to late. Going through Tier 3 (tokens) is like going through a junkyard trying to find something with worth in it. Tier 0 (for example Cryptozoo, Jugs, Squid etc) These Cryptos are most likely scams. They either are because they are blatantly advertised by influencers which are famous for not caring about their fans, beeing randomly advertised by crypto shills (cough Bitboy cough) or their whitepaper indirectly/directly say they are scams(Squid, Rugpull Token). These cryptocurrencies are shitcoins and are only there to benefit its creator. If you feel like Jason Statham in Crank and need the adrenaline rush you can try to flip these tokens in the first minutes (or hours if extremely lucky) before they are beeing rugpulled. These tokens will never be relevant. Do not touch. They are the equivalent of touching radioactive waist. Even interacting with their page could kill you and your wallet(aka draining it). Do not interact with them. I really hope I was a little bit informative for the newer users who are unsure about launches and if to invest in them.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage.

Being a conspiracy theorist wont make you rich,"We have a couple of meme coins pumping right now and there are some whales buying. This has lead people in this sub to speculate that these whales have insider knowledge. A lot of people in crypto believe in whale conspiracy theories. E.g. driving down prices to buy cheaper or setting things up for a rug pull. While the financial market has always had whales doing bad things, it doesn't help if you think whales always get it right. Or if you think every pump will end in a forever dump. Whales get things wrong a lot. If you are old in crypto (pre 2016) you will know of people who were whales in the old days and some who are whales today. The market was small then and we knew who many of the big holders were. These people made mistakes and we saw them clearly. They got rich from BTC and then they would invest in projects that tanked. Some whales have lost a lot from trading. Whales can be just as dumb as many noobs. Whales might be on average more knowledgeable than the noobs but they do make huge mistakes too. Secondly if you think every pump is bound to lead to loss or is manipulation then you would have never made huge gains from BTC & ETH. You were probably the sort of person that never heard about BTC in the early days or who never took it seriously. Your lack of knowledge is not the fault of whales. One of the most frustrating things about this sub is how there are so many terrible investors and traders here who think it is not possible to make big money in crypto because they are bad at it. They think that since they are bad then anyone making money must be doing some manipulation or insider trading. Just because you are bad at picking coins at the right time doesn't mean there are not clever people who can do it. You are the type of person who bought tops while blaming whales of buying at the bottom and no one stopped you buying bottoms too. Pepe is a useless project but if a whale times it right it doesn't always mean they are doing manipulation. They might be smart and make a lot or stupid and lose a lot.

Even that of the inclined reader will see these opportunistically placed options as intent to push an agenda.', 1), ('One of those whales was the one who died by buying pizza.lol😄🍕', 2)]","Being a conspiracy theorist wont make you rich We have a couple of meme coins pumping right now and there are some whales buying. This has lead people in this sub to speculate that these whales have insider knowledge. A lot of people in crypto believe in whale conspiracy theories. E.g. driving down prices to buy cheaper or setting things up for a rug pull. While the financial market has always had whales doing bad things, it doesn't help if you think whales always get it right. Or if you think every pump will end in a forever dump. Whales get things wrong a lot. If you are old in crypto (pre 2016) you will know of people who were whales in the old days and some who are whales today. The market was small then and we knew who many of the big holders were. These people made mistakes and we saw them clearly. They got rich from BTC and then they would invest in projects that tanked. Some whales have lost a lot from trading. Whales can be just as dumb as many noobs. Whales might be on average more knowledgeable than the noobs but they do make huge mistakes too. Secondly if you think every pump is bound to lead to loss or is manipulation then you would have never made huge gains from BTC & ETH. You were probably the sort of person that never heard about BTC in the early days or who never took it seriously. Your lack of knowledge is not the fault of whales. One of the most frustrating things about this sub is how there are so many terrible investors and traders here who think it is not possible to make big money in crypto because they are bad at it. They think that since they are bad then anyone making money must be doing some manipulation or insider trading. Just because you are bad at picking coins at the right time doesn't mean there are not clever people who can do it. You are the type of person who bought tops while blaming whales of buying at the bottom and no one stopped you buying bottoms too. Pepe is a useless project but if a whale times it right it doesn't always mean they are doing manipulation. They might be smart and make a lot or stupid and lose a lot. You too could make smart or dumb moves."

Just lost a small chunk of ETH trying to ape into PEPE,"Listen up, fellow crypto enthusiasts! If you're thinking about accessing an old hot wallet, you might want to proceed with caution. Why? Well, let me tell you a little story. So, today I got the sudden urge to ape into PEPE. I mean, who wouldn't want to throw some small change at a coin named after a cartoon frog, right? Anyway, I decided to check out my old phone, where I had installed Metamask and an old unused hot wallet. I didn't think there was anything valuable in there, so I figured it was safe to use. I copied the wallet address to my new phone, where I keep most of my holdings in a CEX, and transferred a small chunk of ETH to that address. I waited patiently for a few minutes, knowing that the network is currently congested. But after five minutes, then ten, then thirty, I still hadn't received my ETH. Finally, I got a notification telling me that a transfer transaction had occurred 20 minutes ago, along with another transaction telling me that I had sent ETH to another wallet at almost the same time. It suddenly hit me - my freaking wallet had been compromised! Now, I'm not exactly a whale in the crypto world, but losing 0.03 ETH isn't the end of the world for me. But it still hurts knowing that I basically threw money at a hacker. I had already resigned myself to losing every little dime of it anyway, since I was going to use it to ape into PEPE - a coin that pumped 1000x for no apparent reason a few months ago. But it would have been more thrilling to lose my money to a legitimate cause, you know? Anyway, the moral of the story is: don't store anything for too long in your hot wallet, and change it up frequently. And if you do decide to ape into PEPE, make sure you do it with caution. Who knows, maybe you'll end up with a frog in your pocket instead of a hole in your wallet! https://preview.redd.it/zhx804a3xxxa1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ad6a252378809481bba70ee1c81015340a90a8",2,142,2023-05-05 04:33:24,CryptoCurrency,REMINDER,"[("">Now, I'm not exactly a whale in the crypto world, but losing 0.03 ETH isn't the end of the world for me.

The paradox of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has been under 30k for many months now, even under 20k. The thing is that by now, the majority of people have already heard of this name ""Bitcoin"". But for some reason, they are ignoring the prices now only to come back when Bitcoin hits an ATH. The process is like this: Bitcoin hits an all-time high.

"Don't waste time thinking about wasted opportunities in crypto. Instead analize them and decide if you were just unlucky (it happen) or if you made actual mistake. If the former you have nothing to regret, if latter then learn your lesson and be better next time.","Everyone have some regrets in crypto space. It is normal. All of us have stories about ""If only I bought BTC earlier/ didn't ever touch that rugged coin at all / if I would buy this memecoin/ or sell something earlier or later"". But it already happened, either you made mistake or it was just matter of luck. If you didn't DYOR, get rugged or scammed you should admit mistakes were made, learn your lesson and next time not do the same. Improvement is most important step in your crypto journey. Famous saying is: ""If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on you"". You in this quote can mean everything crypto related. Doing something wrong is not thing to be ashamed of, but if you do the same thing over and over you can't balme anyone else than yourself. Also never act like luck were against you. If you need to depend on luck you are a gambler and your decision probably wasn't smart at all. I could buy pepe when it had just $600k marketcap. If I would throw just $20 maybe $50 I would have tens of thousands dollars now. I am bit sad I didn't? Of course, that would be a lot of money. But did I regret it? No. When I heard about this memecoin it didn't stand out, it was another shitcoin that was more likely to rug than make me rich. I made calculated decision to not waste money. In 99% of situations it would be smart. But it pumped like crazy. I could regret it now and try to FOMO into pepe or search for another memecoin that can possibly pump like that. But I know it was only matter of luck and just like back then now I still have no idea why people like it so much. So I have no regrets. I made no mistakes, it was just luck. If that coin would die I wouldn't even know about that and have no second thoughts. Sometimes you need to be ""a man"" and admit something is nothing to regret and you can't learn anything on your decision. If on the other hand I would find some project I truly believe in and which according to my DYOR is great then yes I probably would regret it and should learn on my mistake. Such project for me can be moons. I truly believe in them and according to my best knowledge they have a lot of potential. If they will pump I know it won't be just stupid luck, but all effort Reddit and cc community put in them. Other coins like that are BTC or ETH. Maybe they won't pump as much as some memecoin, but unlike memecoins they aren't popular just cause of hype and some luck. They have quality all of us should consider. If random memecoin pump nothing to regret, it was matter of luck.

I did my research, found a crypto that I thought was cool, it works and is fast and feeless, yet the value continues to disappoint. I didn\'t ""miss out"", but I kinda wish I did.', 1)]","Don't waste time thinking about wasted opportunities in crypto. Instead analize them and decide if you were just unlucky (it happen) or if you made actual mistake. If the former you have nothing to regret, if latter then learn your lesson and be better next time. Everyone have some regrets in crypto space. It is normal. All of us have stories about ""If only I bought BTC earlier/ didn't ever touch that rugged coin at all / if I would buy this memecoin/ or sell something earlier or later"". But it already happened, either you made mistake or it was just matter of luck. If you didn't DYOR, get rugged or scammed you should admit mistakes were made, learn your lesson and next time not do the same. Improvement is most important step in your crypto journey. Famous saying is: ""If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on you"". You in this quote can mean everything crypto related. Doing something wrong is not thing to be ashamed of, but if you do the same thing over and over you can't balme anyone else than yourself. Also never act like luck were against you. If you need to depend on luck you are a gambler and your decision probably wasn't smart at all. I could buy pepe when it had just $600k marketcap. If I would throw just $20 maybe $50 I would have tens of thousands dollars now. I am bit sad I didn't? Of course, that would be a lot of money. But did I regret it? No. When I heard about this memecoin it didn't stand out, it was another shitcoin that was more likely to rug than make me rich. I made calculated decision to not waste money. In 99% of situations it would be smart. But it pumped like crazy. I could regret it now and try to FOMO into pepe or search for another memecoin that can possibly pump like that. But I know it was only matter of luck and just like back then now I still have no idea why people like it so much. So I have no regrets. I made no mistakes, it was just luck. If that coin would die I wouldn't even know about that and have no second thoughts. Sometimes you need to be ""a man"" and admit something is nothing to regret and you can't learn anything on your decision. If on the other hand I would find some project I truly believe in and which according to my DYOR is great then yes I probably would regret it and should learn on my mistake. Such project for me can be moons. I truly believe in them and according to my best knowledge they have a lot of potential. If they will pump I know it won't be just stupid luck, but all effort Reddit and cc community put in them. Other coins like that are BTC or ETH. Maybe they won't pump as much as some memecoin, but unlike memecoins they aren't popular just cause of hype and some luck. They have quality all of us should consider. If random memecoin pump nothing to regret, it was matter of luck. If top project pump then blame not luck but your lack of DYOR and not enough knowledge."

You think the current memecoin frenzy is dumb now? I have a dumb prediction for when the next bull run comes and crazier amounts of dumb money inevitably flow in.,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It's time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun. Look, you can scream ""scam"" and ""rugpull"" all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market's euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino. Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat. There currently aren't many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there's a good chance the next memecoin king doesn't even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can! While it's uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today's memecoin investors are tomorrow's BTC and ETH investors.

Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat. There currently aren't many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL).

Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can!

This latest meme season has shown me Ethereum is unusable as a Layer 1 and you cannot change my mind,"Opening disclosure: I do not promote you do the same, I have a very balanced portfolio but occasionally I will throw left over money into meme hype coins just for fun. This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It all started with Meme season 2021. Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap. Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap. I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops. Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience). Follow my journey - so you won't have to! Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x. Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/18iavmbdu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=015ec783d2ecb55aafdef77fe65e5544227898e4 Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\\You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.) &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/q7svktefu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb98d3a642d489e0c69c47d6b79c811a9e02b9c3 Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lcftvtfgu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13536ae9cc585cf91b2ca81577ba24c9fd5d6715 &#x200B; Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum. And I don't blame you. I have given up on Ethereum. Total Fee cost for the experience $55\~ Total loss $250 ($200 of Wrapped Eth sitting on UniSwap). Its 2023.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

Bridges themselves require liquidity. Anyone can build a bridge and wrap tokens from one chain to another. So they'd have to manage to support the bridge that each wrapped token used because when an asset is bridged to one chain, it has to be locked on the parent chain and it will only unwrap a token it knows as valid - as in it's a token that was wrapped with the bridges contract. It should be relatively easy to accomplish because each L2 has a canonical bridge that almost everyone uses between L1 and L2 but still a design issue for when that doesn't happen to be the case that the bridged asset is from an entirely different bridge ecosystem They can launch a Uniswap version 4 that has a contract that supports, in one contract, authorizing the ability to do the DEX swap and do the bridging but it'll be a more expensive transaction as well as taking longer to execute because of the additional complexity in execution. It would be more streamlined than having 2 web pages to interact with, a DEX and a bridge, but still just as expensive and slow.

This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It all started with Meme season 2021. Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap. Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap. I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops. Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience). Follow my journey - so you won't have to! Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x. Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/18iavmbdu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=015ec783d2ecb55aafdef77fe65e5544227898e4 Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\\You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.) &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/q7svktefu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb98d3a642d489e0c69c47d6b79c811a9e02b9c3 Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lcftvtfgu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13536ae9cc585cf91b2ca81577ba24c9fd5d6715 &#x200B; Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum. And I don't blame you. I have given up on Ethereum. Total Fee cost for the experience $55\~ Total loss $250 ($200 of Wrapped Eth sitting on UniSwap). Its 2023. Eth does not make decentralised money easier IMO."

Ethereum Gas Fees are too damn high!,Just went to stake some more ETH onto Lido and noticed that to do so would cost me around $50 in gas fees. It's insane that these prices are happening because of the meme coin fiasco! I assume this has to do with PEPE coin but surely this isn't a great indicator for crypto if something like this hype can essentially ruin the process for people doing something entirely different? Does anyone have any experience of this beforehand and any way to lower it down to the usual $5ish gas fees I've been paying over the last few months.

Coin with huge potential Angry Pepe $APEPE for all the ANGRYPEPEs who missed their opportunity,,1,0,2023-05-07 02:25:09,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,[],Coin with huge potential Angry Pepe $APEPE for all the ANGRYPEPEs who missed their opportunity
Gas Fees.... OOof,"TL;DR Over the last couple of weeks we have seen ETH gas fees go from \~40-45 Gwei to over 130 Gwei an astronomical increase in such a short time. I feel like I need to say this but I am not against meme tokens but when you account for such a large transaction volume it kinda is the result. One of the biggest causes of this is the meme token PEPE which has led me to wonder about the impact this has to encourage adoption with a higher barrier of entry now existing and the old critique of pricing out people who are only doing $50 to $100 transactions. &#x200B; After months of low transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain users have been hit with transaction costs not seen in over a year. This seems to have generated some unique reactions in my opinion. When Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake (PoS) it seems that some people still think this alone would drive down gas prices. I was surprised to see people still stuck on this idea since this was never the plan for Ethereum. When they first made the move and this rumor even started the developers quickly moved to squash it. Developers pointed to the environmental importance of the move given the political movements against crypto due to power consumption coupled with allowing more users to participate in securing the network. &#x200B; To address the gas fees issues faced other changes were implemented to try and help out the network. I honestly am not sure if they really fully worked to the state that we have given them credit for because crypto was and has been in a winter. Now that it is starting to wake up and move out of it we have seen gas fees go from 30 Gwei to over 140 Gwei a significant change, to say the least. What has led this charge is another meme coin run with PEPE exploding from next to nothing to having a market cap of almost $1.3 billion, larger than The Graph (GRT), the Sandbox (SAND), and even Curve (CRV)! &#x200B; While some people love these episodes and enjoy seeing people end up with windfalls of cash I tend to be much more hesitant about the pros of this. With how much the transaction fees have increased regular Ethereum blockchain users suffer the fallout. People who might have been participating in other ways like DeFi, NFT trading, or investing/utilizing other tokens on the blockchain bear the brunt of this. It also gives people on the outside who could be looking to onboard into crypto pause because the barrier to entry has increased so much. Others who have dogged and hated on crypto as well are given more ammunition to argue against the cause. &#x200B; Arguments can be made either way about the meme token craze and its impact. I am torn between the pros and cons since I love seeing people secure a nice bag odds are new and inexperienced people are the ones who are going to be left holding the bag when the PEPE craze fads as meme token crazes always do. If you made money on PEPE congrats that is amazing! Looking forward though it just seems like it might end up doing more harm than good to the overall crypto industry.",49,211,2023-05-07 02:37:29,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[(""Hey.

OOof TL;DR Over the last couple of weeks we have seen ETH gas fees go from \~40-45 Gwei to over 130 Gwei an astronomical increase in such a short time. I feel like I need to say this but I am not against meme tokens but when you account for such a large transaction volume it kinda is the result. One of the biggest causes of this is the meme token PEPE which has led me to wonder about the impact this has to encourage adoption with a higher barrier of entry now existing and the old critique of pricing out people who are only doing $50 to $100 transactions. &#x200B; After months of low transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain users have been hit with transaction costs not seen in over a year. This seems to have generated some unique reactions in my opinion. When Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake (PoS) it seems that some people still think this alone would drive down gas prices. I was surprised to see people still stuck on this idea since this was never the plan for Ethereum. When they first made the move and this rumor even started the developers quickly moved to squash it. Developers pointed to the environmental importance of the move given the political movements against crypto due to power consumption coupled with allowing more users to participate in securing the network. &#x200B; To address the gas fees issues faced other changes were implemented to try and help out the network. I honestly am not sure if they really fully worked to the state that we have given them credit for because crypto was and has been in a winter. Now that it is starting to wake up and move out of it we have seen gas fees go from 30 Gwei to over 140 Gwei a significant change, to say the least. What has led this charge is another meme coin run with PEPE exploding from next to nothing to having a market cap of almost $1.3 billion, larger than The Graph (GRT), the Sandbox (SAND), and even Curve (CRV)! &#x200B; While some people love these episodes and enjoy seeing people end up with windfalls of cash I tend to be much more hesitant about the pros of this. With how much the transaction fees have increased regular Ethereum blockchain users suffer the fallout. People who might have been participating in other ways like DeFi, NFT trading, or investing/utilizing other tokens on the blockchain bear the brunt of this. It also gives people on the outside who could be looking to onboard into crypto pause because the barrier to entry has increased so much. Others who have dogged and hated on crypto as well are given more ammunition to argue against the cause. &#x200B; Arguments can be made either way about the meme token craze and its impact. I am torn between the pros and cons since I love seeing people secure a nice bag odds are new and inexperienced people are the ones who are going to be left holding the bag when the PEPE craze fads as meme token crazes always do. If you made money on PEPE congrats that is amazing! Looking forward though it just seems like it might end up doing more harm than good to the overall crypto industry."

Why you don't have to listen to people on this sub all the time,"Obviously there are a lot of experts on here who have made decent amounts of profit but please remember that isn't everyone. Also, they might have limited experience or even lost a lot of their money in scams or shitcoins, or perhaps they even trusted the wrong exchange. For some posters there biggest crypto asset might be their moons earned from this subreddit. So you might want to take peoples advice with a pinch of salt. According to Lending Tree: (In a crypto survey where participants took part in a survey posted in Jan '23). The survey is about retail investors: 38% of Investors Have Lost More Money Than Made It Some who've braved the crypto waters have dove deep. After removing the top and bottom 1% of survey respondents, the average amount invested in crypto - according to our research - is $7,738, with a median of $500. Many people have a set amount of money they're able and/or willing to invest. Disclaimer, I do not own much in the way of crypto and now hold only BTC in my portfolio. I read on this subreddit not to trust Binance, but for me as someone with only a small amount on the exchange it's been worth it. I understand the concern, ""not your keys, not your crypto"" but really if you're only holding a small amount, I think you can take the risk and not buy a ledger (which is fairly expensive in itself). I also read that you should not buy PEPE as it's a meme coin and the gas fees will eat you alive. Then another poster posted about how PEPE was being brought to Binance. They also warned not to buy PEPE. I bought PEPE as a short term hold and sure enough it dipped a fair amount yesterday. Then after that it jumped back to its original price and more recently (a couple of hours ago) it jumped up to 10-11%. Then I swapped PEPE to BTC and accrued some more Bitcoin than I would have had by simply buying BTC. So, I'm not saying shitcoins or memecoins are worth holding for any amount of time or even worth purchasing but I will tell you that people who think they are completely right about every topic about crypto are not always on the ball as you might think. They might even have been a bag holder for Solana or might have bought into Bitconnect many moons ago, but you rarely hear about those stories. TL:DR People don't know fuck about shit, even on this subreddit. Although, I'm glad you're all early and congrats to the people who have made it already, but the reality is a lot of people are bag holders or shrimps.

Also, they might have limited experience or even lost a lot of their money in scams or shitcoins, or perhaps they even trusted the wrong exchange. For some posters there biggest crypto asset might be their moons earned from this subreddit. So you might want to take peoples advice with a pinch of salt. According to Lending Tree: (In a crypto survey where participants took part in a survey posted in Jan '23). The survey is about retail investors: 38% of Investors Have Lost More Money Than Made It Some who've braved the crypto waters have dove deep. After removing the top and bottom 1% of survey respondents, the average amount invested in crypto - according to our research - is $7,738, with a median of $500. Many people have a set amount of money they're able and/or willing to invest. Disclaimer, I do not own much in the way of crypto and now hold only BTC in my portfolio. I read on this subreddit not to trust Binance, but for me as someone with only a small amount on the exchange it's been worth it. I understand the concern, ""not your keys, not your crypto"" but really if you're only holding a small amount, I think you can take the risk and not buy a ledger (which is fairly expensive in itself). I also read that you should not buy PEPE as it's a meme coin and the gas fees will eat you alive. Then another poster posted about how PEPE was being brought to Binance. They also warned not to buy PEPE. I bought PEPE as a short term hold and sure enough it dipped a fair amount yesterday. Then after that it jumped back to its original price and more recently (a couple of hours ago) it jumped up to 10-11%. Then I swapped PEPE to BTC and accrued some more Bitcoin than I would have had by simply buying BTC. So, I'm not saying shitcoins or memecoins are worth holding for any amount of time or even worth purchasing but I will tell you that people who think they are completely right about every topic about crypto are not always on the ball as you might think. They might even have been a bag holder for Solana or might have bought into Bitconnect many moons ago, but you rarely hear about those stories. TL:DR People don't know fuck about shit, even on this subreddit. Although, I'm glad you're all early and congrats to the people who have made it already, but the reality is a lot of people are bag holders or shrimps. TL:DR of TL:DR PEPE OK 👌 🐸"

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model.

But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD.

Could this spread as fear in ETH? So the price dumps. High gas fees are a HUGE BENEFIT to Ethereum. How else do you think a blockchain should come up with the money to secure itself, if it doesn't sell blockspace? The base layer isn't for us anymore anyway, just going off the Ethereum roadmap. L1 blockspace is too scarce for every transaction, but it is incredibly secure and decentralized so still very useful. How to utilize that? In the new roadmap - instead of scarce L1 space being consumed to secure one of our transactions it will be consumed to secure an entire blockchain with instead, aka a Rollup. We're meant to use Rollup's now as it will reduce our fees by approx 90% today, and by the end of the summer that will drop potentially to 99% more with www.eip4844.com. That turns a $10 fee to $1, soon to $0.01. Rollups are effectively blockspace compressors and resellers. Since Rollup's are paying that high L1 fee, there's still an insatiable demand for ETH blockspace despite users paying low/no fee. Pretty soon the network will be nearly free to use the same time it's deflationary from so much ETH being consumed, counter intuitive. The IMX rollup is already free to use today, they charge $1 to mint an NFT and use that to subsidise the rest of their network with. Because Rollup's exist INSIDE of Ethereum, if one goes offline or censors you can use the ETH L1 to come get you out. This means a Rollup can be centralized while still inhereting Ethereum's decentralization. A Rollup can't spend or take or mint your money. Fees are all part of the plan. ETH with low fees means it's speculative and very risky/unsustainable, same with BTC with low fees. The new business model is to sell secure blockspace to novel blockchains - they'll pay higher fees than any of us ever could.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high. > > # PRO\'s > > One of the OG Coins > > Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand. > > Transaction Fees and Block Time > > The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies. > > Day-Trader\'s Paradise > > Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.) > > Community Owned > > Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates."" > > Sources: > > [https://dogecoin.com/](https://dogecoin.com/) > > [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y) > > [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) > > [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) > > [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) > > [https://foundation.dogecoin.com/](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) > > [https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) > > [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565) * Would you like to learn more?

"Why Do Developers Create Popular Meme Coins On Ethereum Mainnet Despite Complaints About High Gas Fees From The Majority Of The Investors? Possible Reasons Like Legitimacy, Liquidity, And Forced HODL Explained.","Hi everyone, In the past weeks we saw a lot of meme coins popping up and it turned in to a hype. Yet the majority of these tokens are on Ethereum mainnet which has a lot of gas fees or swapping fees on DEX. Especially when there is a lot of activity on Ethereum mainnet which drives the gas fees up further. But there are a lot of cheaper solutions like L2 solutions which are overlooked for some reason. In this post I try to explain why creators still chose to use Ethereum mainnet. An example is the popular meme coin Pepe: [CoinMarketCap Pepe information and price chart](https://preview.redd.it/vpm4ptoab1za1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f01dae70ce5d31bb4ca40d2b8ab752d2c3a5d79) The three possible reasons (in my opinion) why developers create meme coins on Ethereum mainnet are the following: 1) Legitimacy In the crypto world, Ethereum mainnet is considered one of the most robust chains out there. Additionally, it can make it for example easier for developers to implement complex tokenomics for some particular memecoins. The Ethereum foundation also keeps upgrading their chain. Beside these arguments there are a more legit tokens on Ethereum than on BSC for example. Another advantage is that almost all CEX support Ethereum mainnet, so it's easier for popular meme coins to get listed on big CEX like Binance. For example if a popular meme coin would pop up on Arbitrum Nova it wouldn't list that easy/fast on well-known CEX. 2) Liquidity Ethereum has a lot of liquidity out there since it's the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and it has a big user base. Many whales hold Ethereum in their hot wallets, making it easier for them to buy these tokens with the liquidity in their wallets. Many of these whales are not willing to bridge their ETH to ETH on Arbitrum Nova, for example, just because of the hassle. Don't forget that bridges like Orbiter also have a certain amount of liquidity to bridge, so this could stop a whale from spending (more) money on a particular token. 3) Forced HODL Many smaller investors (or gamblers) only want to invest a small amount of money just in case the tokens pumps. What happens next is that if the token doesn't perform that well, it will cost more in gas fees to convert than the actual value of their holdings to swap back for ETH. This way a lot of ETH stay in the pool and prevents a bigger price drop. This way investors are forced HODLing their meme coin and could potential lead to exit liquidity for whales.

"We were told a that a Bear Market will ""clean"" the market from all of those scams and shitcoins. Now we can see that this was clearly not true...","As a person myself that was present in the Crypto market since 2021 and saw our transition of Bull Market top to Bear market from very close on. Back then, during the first talks of the possible start for a proper Bear Market, there were a lot of expectations. Obviously many negative ones, but some even wanted to turn the narrative into the positives. One of those were about the good side of the Bear Market, the possible ""cleansing"" of the scams, shitcoins and frauds in our Crypto space.

Surging Staking Rewards Rate Generates Record $46M Earnings for Ethereum Validators,"Validators on Ethereum earned a staggering $46 million in the first week of May thanks to a surge in staking rewards rate, which represents the annualized yield of validators. This was a 40% increase from the previous week's earnings of $33 million, with validators receiving 24,997 Ether (ETH) in rewards. The rise of the Pepe memecoin has been a driving force behind the surge in fees on the Ethereum network, with average fees exceeding 100 gwei for the first time since May 2022. As a result, end users are paying over $30 per swap, resulting in increased fee income for validators in addition to their regular rewards. To participate in Ethereum's consensus process, validators are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which is currently valued at approximately $58,000. The current staking rate reflects the expected annualized return for validators. According to Beaconcha.in, validators earned this impressive income by processing transactions on the network. ETH Store, a company that measures reward rates, has identified two types of rewards for Ethereum validators: consensus rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, and transaction fees for processing network transactions.

Best/any resource that gathers crypto centralization data?,"Is there any good resource that compiles crypto centralization data? I'm specifically looking to compare which of my bags are still significantly held by the founding team (XLM, IOTA, ALGO, etc.), and see if there are any promising cryptos I'm not holding that are actually decently decentralized. That's really my TLDR question. The following is a lot of word vomit on the reason I'm asking, so feel free to stop reading here unless you're really bored or trying to avoid work like I am. Anyway- My crypto holdings are mostly BTC at this point, with 0.5-2% bags of a dozen alts (Crypto Jesus and his 12 Altpostles, if you will, though you probably shouldn't). While I will always have a fondness for alts, having gotten lucky essentially revenge investing in previous Reddit darlings like VET and ADA through the 2018 bear, I do want to start fully offloading the ones that are still heavily centralized even after over a decade of crypto's existence. It's still a very young market, but I feel that, in a similar way to how shareholders are really beginning to hold companies accountable for ESG, particularly shitty governance, cryptoholders will eventually say enough is enough and stop condoning centralized blockchains, which is just an oxymoron at the end of the day. I know that day is years away, seeing that stuff like PEPE still happening, but I might as well get ahead of it now since I'm getting old and tired of dealing with crypto's growing pains. And listen, I wasn't immune to the hype either-I was convinced by the claims of impressive technology, such as a vastly superior TPS (though that's not as difficult to achieve on a centralized ledger). I was convinced by the impressive partnerships being formed (though that's not as difficult to achieve if you're essentially giving away your crypto for free or for pennies on the dollar to convince companies to use or even just explore using your crypto). Like I said, I got lucky with some alts, which more than made up for dudsnon-performers that I also kept investing in like ICX and IOTA. I get it, the tech for a lot of these cryptos is still really impressive, which is why I bought in the first place. But the road to hell is paved with great technology with good intentions. I'm no longer impressed by soonTM or ""game-changing"" updates with cool names that people will continue to not use, except for corporations and institutions that are being paid to use the network, and people who want to buy non-fungible rights to GIFs, play games using decades-old graphics and gaming technology (but on the blockchain!), or receive 10% yearly staking/governance rewards on coins that have depreciated 90% in a year. Crypto almost entirely relies on the network effect to create value, and even in the tech world today, promises of ""eye-watering value created by network effects"" are no longer flying with VCs and other investors. I've worked for a long time at a tech company that went public a few years ago, and investors today are really looking for tangible results instead of grandiose promises of potential. Our company also has a significant investor that is struggling financially, so even though we keep beating expectations and producing results quarter after quarter, it's really hard for us to bring on new big investors because they don't want to be the lube for the whale looking to take a massive dump (another reason why I'm wary now of coins with significant foundation holdings. I get that the creators need to be paid, but I don't want to be the one paying a dollar for a penny of current value plus the potential to make a gazillion dollars in the future. I'm happy to reduce potential profits to reduce risk and wait until the founding team shows tangible results that they're building a viable and growing network that could compete or coexist with BTC and ETH). I know I'm sounding really negative right now, but I still truly believe in the vision of blockchain technology, in the same way I still believe in the vision of the U.S., even if the current execution seems FUBAR.

I've worked for a long time at a tech company that went public a few years ago, and investors today are really looking for tangible results instead of grandiose promises of potential. Our company also has a significant investor that is struggling financially, so even though we keep beating expectations and producing results quarter after quarter, it's really hard for us to bring on new big investors because they don't want to be the lube for the whale looking to take a massive dump (another reason why I'm wary now of coins with significant foundation holdings. I get that the creators need to be paid, but I don't want to be the one paying a dollar for a penny of current value plus the potential to make a gazillion dollars in the future. I'm happy to reduce potential profits to reduce risk and wait until the founding team shows tangible results that they're building a viable and growing network that could compete or coexist with BTC and ETH). I know I'm sounding really negative right now, but I still truly believe in the vision of blockchain technology, in the same way I still believe in the vision of the U.S., even if the current execution seems FUBAR. I'll try to shut my trap and wrap this up- TLDR: Is there a good resource that provides info on tokenomics (specifically founding team holdings) for a variety of coins, or are there any promising decentralized cryptos out there?"

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token. > > Doge Pros > > Cult-like community > > In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme. > > Transaction speed and time > > Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use. > > Decentralization > > Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization. * Would you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place. Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state. > > Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities.

Is there any credibility left in the crypto space?,"Many people love to speak like if there is something good in this space. Besides the fast transactions and low fees for moving money around, is there something good left in this space? Shit coins. Alt coins turning into nothing. Scams everywhere. Big exchanges bankrupt every couple of months. Inside trading. Stable coins losing its peg. CeFi platforms destroyed. One man tweeting a meme and sending a coin 11,000 % up, NFTs of rocks selling for millions. Youtubers, influencers and people listening to them (not sure what is worst), multiple copies of projects released on a daily basis, hacks all over the place, zero utility, Web3 nonsense, metaverse and virtual land selling for hundreds of thousands and a year later no one cares any longer. I think the whole idea of crypto had an interesting point when BTC came out. As for today that idea no longer exists because the whole space has been taken over by kids, crypto bros, moon bois, losers and scammers. I'm not saying the traditional financial system works. but I'm wondering if we have any credibility left. How do we really evolve the space into something more serious.

Example: PEPE 🐸 Short term ponzi: The ones developed in Binance Scam Chain (BSC) which when they reach a marketcap the scammers think is fine, they rug pull investors in an instant. Example: SQUID 🦑 * Chameleon ponzi: The ones that change the strategy from short term to long term or otherwise.

He is even killed off in the original comic because Furie felt there was no way to divorce him from the racist associations caused by the memes. Later, he creates a campaign to save and reclaim him, even creating an award winning documentary about the process. It's one of the first examples of the internet really warping a creative work beyond recognition and tearing it from the hands of its creator. Pepe is a character arguably more significant in the ecosystem of memes he spawned rather than the work of fiction itself. Pepe is simultaneously beloved and a hate symbol. Pepe is used everywhere without much controversy but also has an almost unsalvageable reputation. Pepe changes meaning wildly from person to person and bears almost no resemblance to the intent of his original author in a way that is almost wholly unique among literary creations.

This might be a generational thing. I was a teenage edgelord at one point too, but 4chan didn\'t exist yet. I was in some earlier, smaller communities which had similar dynamics, including a few token neonazis in every group who were, regrettably, tolerated by the rest because at the time they seemed like harmless kooks who would never get any power in the real world. I had moved on from such things by the time 4chan started, so I\'m not really steeped in the newer, post-9/11 meme culture. Perhaps if I was 5-20 years younger, I might be inclined to view these memes more favorably. However, I can\'t really imagine trying to keep memes from my teenage edgelord days alive today, so I don\'t understand why the pepe apologists are so intensely keen on keeping the meme alive and denying it\'s a hate symbol.

At this point, pepe is so tarnished that I consider any usage to be suspect, and I treat it as a potential soft radicalization funnel, or deliberate effort to draw young people into the right wing meme-o-sphere.

But please try to step outside your own shoes for a moment, and consider how the perspective might be different for somebody who wasn\'t part of your niche communities where you say positive pepe posts were common for 10 years before the racist ones came along. We don\'t have that prior context, and this character was suddenly thrust into our cultural milieu with very clear and overt far-right associations. > it had an almost decade long history before a bunch of boomers tried to force the ""pepe is racist"" meme I remember the media coverage you\'re referring to, and I didn\'t find anything unreasonable about it. Also it wasn\'t coming from boomers; the typical demographic for those journalists is probably gen X, like myself. They weren\'t trying to ""force"" anything. From my perspective, it was honest and fair reporting about a new and emerging hate symbology. You can draw parallels with the WP hand symbol making a resurgence. People who get caught making this symbol claim that they\'re playing the ""you looked at my hand and now I get to punch you"" game. For me, it doesn\'t really pass the smell test that a bunch of 30-somethings are playing this game when posing for photos. The far more likely proposition is that they are white supremacists signaling their membership so that other members of their in-group can easily recognize them. The media covered this similarly to pepe, and what I observed in the far-right communities where I was lurking at the time, was that posters in these communities ridiculed the media similarly to how they did with the pepe coverage. My point is that it\'s incredibly easy to dismiss a media narrative by saying ""That\'s ridiculous; they\'re just a bunch of out of touch boomers."" You can say that, and it will resonate with people, regardless of whether it\'s true. The far right knows this, and makes a deliberate strategy out of this type of deflection. > (which itself was a 4chan troll but this comment\'s long enough already without explaining that). I\'m not really buying any argument based on ""sorry bro, just trolling"" in 2023. Sorry but this line of rhetoric just doesn\'t fly with me. And my assessment, at the time of that media coverage, was that the faux outrage from supposedly innocent pepe fanboys was the real 4chan troll op. > Aldo just an addendum to that, it\'s not like all the (iirc) Hindu swastikas were dynamited after 1945, nor should they be. Agreed. That symbol has its own, much older, meaning within that culture. However, it\'s pretty much unavoidably tainted within Western cultures due to its close association with Nazi ideology in our culture. Hence, people in our Western society who are not far right extremists, don\'t go around displaying swastikas. Pepe now has similar associations, and it doesn\'t have thousands of years of cultural history to absolve it of the nazi connection. > To do that would be to bend the knee and legitimize the racist context over every other innocuous or even good context. I\'d rather not let Nazis have nice things lol I agree with your sentiment here, and your feelings are perfectly valid, but I would argue that it doesn\'t really reflect reality. You\'re free to like pepe, and you\'re not a bad person if the meme has positive associations for you. But I am honestly telling you how others outside of your bubble will view it. We will suspect you are a far right extremist. Sucks for you, sucks for Pepe\'s creator.

They\'re working on a stricter KYC and they\'re also expanding the legal and compliance teams by hiring many experts in the field. > > The co-operation between Binance and regulators was demonstrated when the exchange [limited its services for people from Russia](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/4887e569afdf4b1e89e024371d3a49b9). > > IT GIVES YOU DISCOUNTS ON BINANCE > > One of the reasons why Binance is so popular is the fact that their [transaction fees are among the lowest](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311). Users pay just 0.1% for most popular types of trades, whereas on e.g. Coinbase (Pro) it\'s 5 times more - [0.5%](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees). One of the benefits of BNB is making those fees even lower - by as much as 25%. Using BNB to pay for transaction fees can save you up to 1/4 of your money on transactions. It\'s a big incentive to hold some BNB. > > IT IS DEFLATIONARY > > In 2021, Binance implemented two important changes to BNB burning mechanism. > > First, [Bruno Upgrade v1.1.5](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-smart-chain-bruno-upgrade-v1-1-5/) took place on 30 November. It introduced real-time burning mechanism. It is similar to [ETH London Upgrade](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/fixing-the-ethereum-fee-market-eip-1559-9109f1c1814b) \\- some of the gas fee collected by validators is burned. As of 15 June 2022, [more than 90 000 BNB were burned](https://twitter.com/BurnBNB). > > Furthermore, on 23 December 2021, Binance announced and implemented BNB Auto-Burn protocol. It replaces quarterly burns which were based on the profits Binance made (they committed 20% of their profit to buy back BNB and then burn it. There were [17 quarterly burns](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/17th-bnb-burn-%7C-quarterly-highlights-and-insights-from-cz-421499824684902908)). Now, the process is automated, which makes it more transparent and predictable. The core idea has not been changed, however, the process will stop when the number of BNB coins in circulation is lower than 100 million. > > MANY TRADING PAIRS, STAKING, FARMING AND OTHER USES > > As an official coin of Binance, BNB also offers a multitude of trading pairs. All transactions made with BNB are lightning fast and secure since it\'s based on one of the most secure blockchains - Ethereum. > > There are also many options of staking BNB on Binance for a very good APY or participating in Launchpools (farming new tokens) and Launchpads (Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) - buying new tokens). > > BNB is accepted by some service providers, e.g. HTC, trip.io, travala.com, BitTorrent or PureVPN. > > Last but not least, BNB can be used to convert ""leftovers"". Very often when you sell a coin, a very small amount of it is left in your wallet. On Binance, you can convert small amounts of coins (called ""dust"") into BNB. > > TWO BLOCKCHAINS THAT WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY > > BNB operates on two chains, the above mentioned Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which was launched in September 2020. While Binance Chain is responsible for transactions made on Binance DEX, BSC was designed specifically for smart contracts, DeFi and dApps. It quickly became one of the biggest blockchains. It is compatible with Ethereum allowing other projects to transfer easily from ETH to BSC and escape high gas fees on ETH. > > This dual blockchain approach combined with the Proof of Staked Authority consensus algorithm (a mix of share proof and authority proof) makes it much more scalable than Ethereum and enables faster and cheaper transactions. While Ethereum runs around 9 000 nodes/validators (before the software bug back in the end of August 2021), BSC needs only 21 validators. > > It is also worth pointing out that Binance allocated $100 million for projects that launch on BSC. > > DECENTRALIZATION AT ALL COST? > > The main argument against BNB is that it is centralized. And it\'s impossible to deny the fact that BNB indeed is centralized compared to Ethereum and many other projects. But every stick has two ends. This is what Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO, has to say about (de)centralization: > > [Many people think of decentralization as absolute; you are either decentralized or not. I think that in reality, there is a gradient scale from centralization to decentralized. Often, a better question is: how decentralized should we (exchanges, societies) be, now and in the future? If decentralization simply increases freedom but decreases security and ease-of-use, there is a point where it becomes a net negative, and may not be worth it.](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/cz-on-centralization-vs-decentralization-301982828007075840) > > If decentralization is also about freedom of choice, then maybe being able to choose a centralized blockchain(s) should be accepted. > > \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ > > ^(Additional sources:) > > [^(https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#COIN-BURN)](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#COIN-BURN) > > [^(https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#BNB-RIGHT)](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb#BNB-RIGHT) > > [^(https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/2af5831727164545b8a2c665fae8bc04)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/2af5831727164545b8a2c665fae8bc04) > > [^(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-coin-bnb-why-interesting-110049570.html)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-coin-bnb-why-interesting-110049570.html) > > [^(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp) > > [^(https://trading-education.com/pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-binance-coin)](https://trading-education.com/pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-binance-coin) > > [^(https://guarda.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-binance-smart-chain/?utm\\\\source=Reddit&utm\\_medium=Social&utm\\_campaign=CryptoCurrency-BSC-article)](https://guarda.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-binance-smart-chain/?utm\\source=Reddit&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=CryptoCurrency-BSC-article) > > [^(https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20815/binance-and-regulatory-scrutiny-changing-times-for-the-crypto-market)](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20815/binance-and-regulatory-scrutiny-changing-times-for-the-crypto-market) * Would you like to learn more?

I foolishly clicked on one of the many ""Pepe airdrop"" links that got spammed on here earlier in the week. I saw the ""spam"" comments, but for some reason still clicked it. I thought just connecting a wallet couldnt hurt to see. I connected my metamask wallet which was empty. nothing happened. For some reason I then connected my main wallet (Trustwallet), with my 0.7 eth and a few other smaller bags. Then came the prompts to approve or reject what I assume now, was the smart contract. I don't know why, or what was going on in my head. I thought it would be more clear what I was giving access to I guess. but I didn't think and clicked approve. nothing happens so I just closed the site and didn't think about it until 3 days later when I noticed what had happened. I am absolutely gutted. I know it's not a huge bag, and it's not financially crippling for me. but I just have a horrible feeling lingering in me now. how could I be so stupid.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token.

Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network.

All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD.

Even i was lucky to get on the hype train at the right time and made some profit. As someone said, great investments doesn't always mean great businesses. This is more true in crypto. Unless you're in it just for the tech which i highly doubt, you have no reason to hate it or the insiders who made profit off of it. Try to understand the ongoing trend and ride the wave. I'm not encouraging anyone to put your money in memecoins now, but just outright hating anything won't make you learn a thing. Just look at those people in buttcoin sub as an example. Don't be like them. Edit: saying this again, I'm not encouraging anyone to buy, even i won't buy any other meme coin again. Its just that i saw people hating it like anything, while at the same time some were putting their money in and took profits. So Just putting out my perspective."

Okay that was a joke, but you see my point. The value of this is going to be directly determined by the whales. What I am trying to incoherently say is, 10 years ago, crypto as a mainstream ideal was unheard of. Today, we see these currencies compared to the biggest markets on the planet. In 30 years time, what side will you choose to be on? Dca and hodl you Muppets, because one day when your kids say daddy, did you buy into US GOV COIN when it was 10 cents?

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token. > > Doge Pros > > Cult-like community > > In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme. > > Transaction speed and time > > Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use. > > Decentralization > > Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization. * Would you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high. > > # CON\'s > > Memecoin Limitations > > Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin. > > Unlimited Supply > > There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code. > > Price Manipulation by Famous People > > It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price. > > Sources: > > [https://dogecoin.com/](https://dogecoin.com/) > > [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) > > [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) > > [https://foundation.dogecoin.com/](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) > > [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) > > [https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) > > [https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) > > [https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) > > [https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) > > [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) > > [https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/) Would you like to learn more?

Also, everytime people like me warn about shit like this, it's always the same people upset ""no no, you don't know what you're talking about"" But I do, obviously. If you sit around a certain sector for many years , you will eventually gain enough foresight to get a good sense of things. I may not know what coin will make you rich , but I can easily see some that won't. That's a start. I told you Bitcoin gold, and cash where garbage that will eventually fall off the charts slowly but surely. I told you about safemoon, Xtrabytes , EOS, and cardano will give you negative long term. It's always the same argument back at me. These coins at this second might give you a return. But once they go higher, it's never going to be the same again. I can't say the same thing for eth or Bitcoin. These are cryptos that prove doubt wrong. These are cryptos that will give you returns holding long term.

Some blockchains make use of a Proof of Stake consensus, but Harmony employs an unique Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) system that integrates sharding and proof of stake to achieve a secure and scalable network - one that makes it a cut above the rest. Not only that, EPoS allows staking from hundreds of validators, which preempts the problem of stake centralisation. > 2. Harmony aims to be interoperable and facilitates transactions between different chains. To this end, it is making inroads. It has integrated with Chainlink since Chainlink's decentralised oracle launched on Harmony. As such, enterprises who wish to use ONE can benefit from trustworthy price feeds of off-chain data provided by Chainlink. Plus. Harmony has integrated with Band Protocol to come up with a secure blockchain for decentralised applications.

PEPE banned address with millions,"[https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html](https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html) Basically PEPE Dev banned an address with more than 20 millions BRL (about 4 million dollars) in PEPE because the address seems to be linked with MEV Bots.

ONE itself is used on the network for all activities like voting, gas fees, and staking.

Rug pull scams are actually crimes, where dev intentionally misled buyers to suck out their liquidity in scam. Pepe is a shitcoin/memecoin. The devs themselves said the coin is useless on their website. They aren\'t promising ""revolutionizing the space with ultra tech"" or delivering some ""kick ass app or protocol"". They made it clear you can\'t have any expectation on them for further development. You trade it for momentum and have to accept your wins/loses as gambling. So it can\'t be a rug based on dev\'s fake promises, because there aren\'t any promises on building. However, there is an implicit promises that the dev won\'t destroy the liquidity pool and you have control of your coins to trade/move around. I think the devs have already burnt their LP and renounced the contract. Furthermore, it is listed on Binance and Kraken soon so the dev won\'t have enough selling pressure to obliterate liquidity.

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining.""

Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary. > > So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good?

One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said: > > The Energy Fud Was Killed > The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed. > Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers. > There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector. > > [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/) > > &#x200B; > > # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug. > > &#x200B; > > Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin.

What kind of coins did you mainly buy?,"According to my observations, there are a few types of coins depending on their market movement and utility. 1. Bitcoin - first cryptocurrency, king of our hearts, leading the market since its creation. 2. Coins that show potential and deliver - projects like Ethereum that are promising novelties, solutions to problems, etc. and actually deliver good services and have great developers. This shows in their market trends as they usually make their way upwards over a longer period. 3. Coins that show potential but fail to deliver - Not all coins are scams. I do believe that some projects really mean to develop as solutions to some problems and are planning to upgrade the existing tech. Unfortunately as the time goes, their roadmap gets posponed and postponed. They might deliver but in a very stretched timeframe. Eventually people lose interest in them and only the religious bag holders still hope for the project's development. 4. Meme coins ""pump and dump"" - we all know these, they usually dont last long on the market, developers hype people into buying and then sell their bags, usually leaving other holders unable to even sell for loss. 5. Meme coins that pump and dump and then somehow stay there - Im talking about Dogecoin for example. First meant as a total meme, but now has its own blockchain and even some utility.

The APY is, since I joined Binance, pretty nice, I would say around 5-10%. With the launchpool, you'll receive those new tokens, and as every crypto, they can boom or get doomed :) . > > \\- Launchpad : basically, let you buy new token before they get listed on Binance at a discount price. Last one was Stepn (GMT token), where you could buy the token for around $0.01. When GMT token was listed, price was around 0.15 so if you sold at that time, you already did a 1500% profit. Now sitting at 0.72, +7200%. You need to hold a high amount of BNB to benefit the more of this program, as only a portion of your BNB can be used to purchase those tokens in the launchpad program. So the more BNB you hold, the more return you'll make with this. > > \\-Binance Card : Binance offers a Visa card, with cashback up to 8% on every purchase you make with the card. Once again, the more BNB you hold, the more cashback you can get, eg. if you hold 1 BNB, you'll be eligible for 2% cashback, 10 BNB offers 3%. To get 8%, you'll have to hold 600 BNB. The cashback you'll get will be paid in BNB, which you can hold to try to get an higher level of cashback, and have more to participate to the next launchpad/launchpool, or just swap/convert it to your preferred crypto. > > Binance pay : it lets you pay for good and services with your BNB, eg. pay for an hotel or even send money to a friend. > > \\-Fees: if you have some BNB in your SPOT account, you can pay for every fees when you make an order with BNB, and save 25% on fees. > > \\-dust convert : it let you convert any dust amount of crypto you might have after trading or withdrawing to your preferred wallet to BNB. Fees apply obviously, but at least you can do something with those 2 cents of xxx tokens instead of leaving them on your spot account. Since you pay your trading fees with BNB, those few cents cumulated can maybe be used to pay for the fees of your next order. > > > Now those are pretty cool, but what if you're not using Binance? > > Well, since its launch in 2017, BNB has been on the rise. In about 5 years, it is around 1,000,000% up. The real rise happened last year during the bull market, when on January 1st 2021, its price was sitting around $38 and went up to $686.31 in 2021 may (info from coingecko). Now we know how the market was last year, with a pretty good start of the year, a fall in may-august, then an uptrend until November, and a fall again. Even with all those events, BNB had performed very well, and managed to climb to the 3rd spot of cryptocurrencies by market cap (stable coin excluded). It has been pretty stable and is holding his seat pretty well since then unlike some other top 10 crypto. > > Last be not least, BNB can be used on DEX, Pancake swap being the preferred option there, where you can use your BNB and swap them for any token available there. Swap fees, transfer fees will be paid in BNB as BNB is the native token of the BNB chain. Fees are pretty low though. BNB is supported on a variety of wallet like Ledger, Trezor, Metamask or Trust wallet.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token. > > Doge Pros > > Cult-like community > > In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme. > > Transaction speed and time > > Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use. > > Decentralization > > Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization. * Would you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place. Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state. > > Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention.

Hardware comparing Model T vs Nano X,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X. Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides. Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods. The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely. Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware? (Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing) &#x200B; Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices. &#x200B; &#x200B; # Security chip The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances). Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this. &#x200B; # Size of the memory Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB &#x200B; # Supported coins Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides. Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods. The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely. Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware? (Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing) &#x200B; Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices. &#x200B; &#x200B; # Security chip The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances). Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this. &#x200B; # Size of the memory Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB &#x200B; # Supported coins Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

But I've never seen any news about Kraken listing PEPE for a week, now I'm here to prove a point. So Kraken listed PEPE in May 16/17 depending on your timezone, and for some reason it didn't made news in this sub. Not in HOT page, nor in TRENDING.

The same PEPE that is by far one of the most well-known and easily in top 100 most valuable tokens by market cap. This is embarrassing for the ""future of finance"" in crypto","PEPE is by far one off the most popular tokens. It was ranked in the top 50 tokens after hitting very nearly a 2 Billion market cap. Even today it still sits in the top 100 after losing over a Billion of market cap. It saw insane price increase of 1000% in a week, even before the Binance listing which again doubled the price. If you ask someone to randomly name a few crypto tokens, PEPE will probably be in that list. There's definitely very few in crypto who haven't heard of PEPE.

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he's lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. However, there's more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it's a little easier to make profits in crypto. He's undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it's still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world's largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it's also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he's unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each. While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling! Edit to add: I should've titled this ""but only in there money he's lost"".

2013 - My first Bitcoin transaction,"Looking back at my very first P2P transaction in 2013, I remembered how nervous I was. But it worked surprisingly easy. I just choose one of the many offerings of BTC and went for it. Until one day in 2017 friends were discussing the price development and I got curious. I was surprised how much my small investment made, and that there are people willing to buy that small amount of BTC from me, which I paid for so much less!

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token.

Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

The nail in the coffin is this: https://preview.redd.it/pgd5c9c8au3b1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e24c127df14fe505f1c8bc0211c83dc4c7fe1b The address 0xA9011e45e70914c52738498c7FBD73760d348DB1 [sent 0.1 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x187701c0e875714fdfc4441b160b26b7b933e549ef54bf815f464ae300fa3fbe) to the ""Official sale address"" on May 7, 2023 and never received any Pepe following the ""sale ending"". The latest transaction to the ""Official sale address"" was 2 minutes ago from the time of me writing this and was 0.01199615 ETH ($30.53 CAD). Perhaps the ad is still attracting the gullible, which is quite unfortunate. Do you believe that Reddit should be allowed to promote scams? Is it up to users of Reddit to recognize the advertisements are just propaganda. Have any of you seen this particular ad or similar ads on Reddit in the past? I have never owned any PEPE!"

"Be careful. Now, when trading volume has fallen off, is when exchanges can start to fail. Already two have frozen withdrawals, another collapsed and several other lose a huge customer base in the US. And a number of exchanges are showing clear signs of stress like dropping nearly all fees to zero","&#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0plrhcbuj74b1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=952fec461cdfb6ff09dd1c3d1e0bdcd4bda31d8f This chart shows Bitcoin trading volume for the past 3 years and the current lows of trading volume are clearly visible. Volume is even lower than during pre-FTX 2022 when exchanges and platforms were freeing withdrawals and falling left and right. It is fairly obvious why this is bad for exchanges as less trading means less fees, that account for the majority of exchange revenue. This tends to put a lot of stress on exchanges and you see it in the promotions offered by them. For instance, FTX ran more than double the amount of trading competition promotions they did in the prior year than they did in the 10 months running up to their collapse in an effort to encouraging trading. Let's go through the activities stressed exchanges are doing to encourage trading. As some examples: MEXC recently has dropped both their spot maker and taker fees to 0%. Futures maker fees are also 0% and futures taker fees are dropped to 0.01%. Now, they only make money off futures takers trades and withdrawal fees. This is in addition to the MANY promotion/trading competition emails they send) &#x200B; [MEXC](https://preview.redd.it/dl2jjkl9m74b1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a33429187f44fe8856506fee1d5748c37d5aae) Gate.io dropped spot trading maker fees and fiat currency trading fees to 0 with 0% maker and taker fees on BTC-margined futures. &#x200B; [Gate.io](https://preview.redd.it/zamcgn3lm74b1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9836d7493a7acf02e7f365697019ea1d301c0c3b) Binance have ramped up activity on their launchpad pushing a lot more new projects. They also have quite infamously listed useless tokens of PEPE and FLOKI. It was quite atypical for them to list such a ew (and useless) token in PEPE and you should also question why they only now decided to list FLOKI as well. Bianance is also still running their BTC zero-fee promotion of the TUSD quoted pair. &#x200B; Remember, things must be pretty extreme for exchange to choose to take ZERO fees for the majority of their products. If people are buying, there'd be no need to drop fees to encourage more trading. A number of exchanges/platforms have also lost access to US markets as platforms like Binance and Nexo have left Canada, due to new regulations. Bittrex, Nexo and MEXC had already closed doors to US customers, while others in the US face uncertainty. Coinbase is the most prominent, has been forced to stop its lending product as well as many Cefi staking service providers have been forced to stop its lending product and Binance's BUSD is a dying coin as their issuer Paxos was ordered to stop minting. All of this obvious take it hit to revenue. Now the dominoes have already begun to fall. Hotbit, an exchange that serviced over 1 million people, has shut down very recently and BKEX, one servicing over 8 million, has frozen all customer withdrawals for some shady reasons that they claim to be aiding in police investigations. Patricia, another platform that service close to 1 million has also frozen withdrawals. It's a little* weird because there were also allegations of money laundering around two of them, and allegations of a hack involved in another but the reality is that exchanges are always dealing with money laundering accusations(because of the anonymity of crypto) and investigations and there are always hacks occurring under the radar. But make no mistake that anytime trade volume is low, fees are low, so revenue is low and that's prime time for a crash.

Now, when trading volume has fallen off, is when exchanges can start to fail. Already two have frozen withdrawals, another collapsed and several other lose a huge customer base in the US. And a number of exchanges are showing clear signs of stress like dropping nearly all fees to zero &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0plrhcbuj74b1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=952fec461cdfb6ff09dd1c3d1e0bdcd4bda31d8f This chart shows Bitcoin trading volume for the past 3 years and the current lows of trading volume are clearly visible. Volume is even lower than during pre-FTX 2022 when exchanges and platforms were freeing withdrawals and falling left and right. It is fairly obvious why this is bad for exchanges as less trading means less fees, that account for the majority of exchange revenue. This tends to put a lot of stress on exchanges and you see it in the promotions offered by them. For instance, FTX ran more than double the amount of trading competition promotions they did in the prior year than they did in the 10 months running up to their collapse in an effort to encouraging trading. Let's go through the activities stressed exchanges are doing to encourage trading. As some examples: MEXC recently has dropped both their spot maker and taker fees to 0%. Futures maker fees are also 0% and futures taker fees are dropped to 0.01%. Now, they only make money off futures takers trades and withdrawal fees. This is in addition to the MANY promotion/trading competition emails they send) &#x200B; [MEXC](https://preview.redd.it/dl2jjkl9m74b1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a33429187f44fe8856506fee1d5748c37d5aae) Gate.io dropped spot trading maker fees and fiat currency trading fees to 0 with 0% maker and taker fees on BTC-margined futures. &#x200B; [Gate.io](https://preview.redd.it/zamcgn3lm74b1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9836d7493a7acf02e7f365697019ea1d301c0c3b) Binance have ramped up activity on their launchpad pushing a lot more new projects. They also have quite infamously listed useless tokens of PEPE and FLOKI. It was quite atypical for them to list such a ew (and useless) token in PEPE and you should also question why they only now decided to list FLOKI as well. Bianance is also still running their BTC zero-fee promotion of the TUSD quoted pair. &#x200B; Remember, things must be pretty extreme for exchange to choose to take ZERO fees for the majority of their products. If people are buying, there'd be no need to drop fees to encourage more trading. A number of exchanges/platforms have also lost access to US markets as platforms like Binance and Nexo have left Canada, due to new regulations. Bittrex, Nexo and MEXC had already closed doors to US customers, while others in the US face uncertainty. Coinbase is the most prominent, has been forced to stop its lending product as well as many Cefi staking service providers have been forced to stop its lending product and Binance's BUSD is a dying coin as their issuer Paxos was ordered to stop minting. All of this obvious take it hit to revenue. Now the dominoes have already begun to fall. Hotbit, an exchange that serviced over 1 million people, has shut down very recently and BKEX, one servicing over 8 million, has frozen all customer withdrawals for some shady reasons that they claim to be aiding in police investigations. Patricia, another platform that service close to 1 million has also frozen withdrawals. It's a little* weird because there were also allegations of money laundering around two of them, and allegations of a hack involved in another but the reality is that exchanges are always dealing with money laundering accusations(because of the anonymity of crypto) and investigations and there are always hacks occurring under the radar. But make no mistake that anytime trade volume is low, fees are low, so revenue is low and that's prime time for a crash. Just remember that it's not your keys."

Here are my versions of what the bear has taught us so far : - Every old saying which are always thought of being true can be Wrong all along all of a sudden. Not your keys , not your coins , Yeah Ledger and Atomic Wallet ? . - Apeing into some hotshots tokens during brutal market will always rekt you. (PEPE). - Crypto market isn't bullet proof / standalone yet and relies to macro economics quite a lot. - Everything can fall no matter how big it is. (do i really need to list out the fallen crypto businesses ? ) - Treat any crypto businesses as Shady, unethical, and guilty unless they are being proven otherwise. - Worshipping an individual instead of looking into their project / business will always rekt you. - Influencers and crypto youtubers has no interest for your investment and treat you merely as numbers. - Nothing is safe, cex , dex, hot wallets , cold wallets , until proven otherwise.

"The bear market is doing an adequate job cleansing the crypto space of bad projects and actors.

Stalking a Scammer: A Game of Shitrugs,"It's been slightly less than a month since I made a reckless purchase of NUT, an event that led me to the discovery of an entire kingdom of shitcoin scams that is ongoing this very second. Since I busted that fateful NUT, I have found myself contacting exchanges, tracking quite literally thousands of Ethereum wallets, and even filing a report to the US Secret Service, all in an attempt to put an end to this serial scammer who I gave the nickname Shitrugger. Most, if not all, of my attempts have proven to be a failure. I am waiting for a response from the Secret Service, but I doubt anything will come of it. The exchange Bybit at first gave me hope, as they responded to my email. But after sending tons of transaction hashes, they simply said they couldn't help. I was able to trace deposits and withdrawals from Binance as well, however I feel their hands are full at the moment and have not found the effort to contact them. I have come to the conclusion that putting a stop to this scam is likely out of my range of abilities. I'm up to about 600 shitcoins created in 3 weeks I've been able to track. The number of trading wallets used to create fake trade volume I've found might be close to 10,000. I've followed Shitrugger from Bybit, through Arbitrum bridges, and to Binance. Stopping this Dynasty of Shit could be done by one of these centralized exchanges, if they have KYC. But me? Me and my NUT? When it comes down to it, I don't even understand how cryptocurrencies actually work. If you look in my Google history, you'll find ""wat is a blockchan?"" in my recent searches. But I have had a hell of a time following all this. I've learned a ton about Ethereum and that has spurred me to learn even more. Despite a likely failure in stopping Shitrugger, I'm still curious about the entire underworld surrounding shitcoin trading. So, I decided to take a gander at the sorts of folks buying Shitrugger's scam coins. My dear Moon farmers, let's see what I find: https://preview.redd.it/hcju2910p35b1.jpg?width=1868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=317554d2767f09eb50e9d765b57a6765f039c60c This first picture is of the transaction history for GANG, just one of the shitcoins in a long line of shitcoins created by Shitrugger. The highlighted ""multicall"" is one of the functions of Shitrugger - it pretty much blacklists a trader's wallet so they are unable to sell. Here's the evidence of that: https://preview.redd.it/7dns2nqip35b1.jpg?width=1208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eeef3292830d66536bbe351915cf48343d13cff Clicking that transaction and scrolling down until you can ""view more"" gets you to some of the raw data of the transaction. Hitting the ""decode"" button makes things a little clearer: https://preview.redd.it/d2szy5hrp35b1.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cf24dc0e1b9bfeb18cfe10e6fbdada08685253b That there is the address of who made the trade. Lets just see what this particular trader has been up to: https://preview.redd.it/08sb6c5xp35b1.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de873bb26e876bcac095c30f7571d6bdae918d93 Well, well, well. This chap seems to have been very lucky with an early PEPE purchase. Nearly $2.5 MILLION in PEPE, plus a metric fuckton of worthless shitcoins. I scrolled through most of their erc-20 tokens, and a good amount appear to be Shitrugger's product. Let's have a look at their most recent swap: https://preview.redd.it/em4aicu4q35b1.jpg?width=1694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf8a5c0581783aa11399b7bb63ec905682113764 Following the top transaction from above, I found they had just bought a token called StarDAO. Sounds fishy. So I looked at StarDAO and wouldn't you know it, it had just been created, seeded with a suspiciously familiar amount of ETH. Shortly after, StarDAO rugged. Looks like I found another of Shitrugger's shitcoins, verified by backtracking until I found a link to previous Shitrugger coins using Arkham Intelligence. However, I noticed something odd: https://preview.redd.it/5y0as1sjq35b1.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78930dad2fd55cfaca9c3c732404a6325555908b Notice above that there are zero ""multicall"" entries, but instead many ""approve"" entries. Looking into those, it appears they do the EXACT SAME THING - it blacklists the wallet when it attempts to trade. It seems Shitrugger has changed up the code a bit. What I did from here is wait to see if an ""approve"" transaction popped up that had a matching address to the PEPE millionaire. Well, there wasn't one, which means that PEPE Boy never tried to sell StarDAO before it rugged (which isn't surprising, it rugged 1 hour after creation). From here, I decided to look at one of the ""approve"" entries in order to see who just got blacklisted. I found something else odd: https://preview.redd.it/lrw9dtbqq35b1.jpg?width=1761&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0731fbe8b6eb3b645918a5f9bf14e201925f9d3 The name of this address is dimethyltryptamine.eth and they have $2.7 million in PEPE - oddly close to PEPE Boy. They also have a metric fuckton of Shitrugger's tokens in their wallet, most of the same ones as PEPE Boy. So what can be learned from all this? I'm still trying to sus it all out, but bottom line: Shitrugger is making a LOT of cash from these shitcoin traders, and shitcoin traders can easily afford to lose that money if just one coin takes off. If PEPE Boy spend $200 on each of the 101 shitcoins in their wallet, the cost basis overall is $20,200, but their profit is $2,395,026 because of that one PEPE swap.

Since I busted that fateful NUT, I have found myself contacting exchanges, tracking quite literally thousands of Ethereum wallets, and even filing a report to the US Secret Service, all in an attempt to put an end to this serial scammer who I gave the nickname Shitrugger. Most, if not all, of my attempts have proven to be a failure. I am waiting for a response from the Secret Service, but I doubt anything will come of it. The exchange Bybit at first gave me hope, as they responded to my email. But after sending tons of transaction hashes, they simply said they couldn't help. I was able to trace deposits and withdrawals from Binance as well, however I feel their hands are full at the moment and have not found the effort to contact them. I have come to the conclusion that putting a stop to this scam is likely out of my range of abilities. I'm up to about 600 shitcoins created in 3 weeks I've been able to track. The number of trading wallets used to create fake trade volume I've found might be close to 10,000. I've followed Shitrugger from Bybit, through Arbitrum bridges, and to Binance. Stopping this Dynasty of Shit could be done by one of these centralized exchanges, if they have KYC. But me? Me and my NUT? When it comes down to it, I don't even understand how cryptocurrencies actually work. If you look in my Google history, you'll find ""wat is a blockchan?"" in my recent searches. But I have had a hell of a time following all this. I've learned a ton about Ethereum and that has spurred me to learn even more. Despite a likely failure in stopping Shitrugger, I'm still curious about the entire underworld surrounding shitcoin trading. So, I decided to take a gander at the sorts of folks buying Shitrugger's scam coins. My dear Moon farmers, let's see what I find: https://preview.redd.it/hcju2910p35b1.jpg?width=1868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=317554d2767f09eb50e9d765b57a6765f039c60c This first picture is of the transaction history for GANG, just one of the shitcoins in a long line of shitcoins created by Shitrugger. The highlighted ""multicall"" is one of the functions of Shitrugger - it pretty much blacklists a trader's wallet so they are unable to sell. Here's the evidence of that: https://preview.redd.it/7dns2nqip35b1.jpg?width=1208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eeef3292830d66536bbe351915cf48343d13cff Clicking that transaction and scrolling down until you can ""view more"" gets you to some of the raw data of the transaction. Hitting the ""decode"" button makes things a little clearer: https://preview.redd.it/d2szy5hrp35b1.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cf24dc0e1b9bfeb18cfe10e6fbdada08685253b That there is the address of who made the trade. Lets just see what this particular trader has been up to: https://preview.redd.it/08sb6c5xp35b1.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de873bb26e876bcac095c30f7571d6bdae918d93 Well, well, well. This chap seems to have been very lucky with an early PEPE purchase. Nearly $2.5 MILLION in PEPE, plus a metric fuckton of worthless shitcoins. I scrolled through most of their erc-20 tokens, and a good amount appear to be Shitrugger's product. Let's have a look at their most recent swap: https://preview.redd.it/em4aicu4q35b1.jpg?width=1694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf8a5c0581783aa11399b7bb63ec905682113764 Following the top transaction from above, I found they had just bought a token called StarDAO. Sounds fishy. So I looked at StarDAO and wouldn't you know it, it had just been created, seeded with a suspiciously familiar amount of ETH. Shortly after, StarDAO rugged. Looks like I found another of Shitrugger's shitcoins, verified by backtracking until I found a link to previous Shitrugger coins using Arkham Intelligence. However, I noticed something odd: https://preview.redd.it/5y0as1sjq35b1.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78930dad2fd55cfaca9c3c732404a6325555908b Notice above that there are zero ""multicall"" entries, but instead many ""approve"" entries. Looking into those, it appears they do the EXACT SAME THING - it blacklists the wallet when it attempts to trade. It seems Shitrugger has changed up the code a bit. What I did from here is wait to see if an ""approve"" transaction popped up that had a matching address to the PEPE millionaire. Well, there wasn't one, which means that PEPE Boy never tried to sell StarDAO before it rugged (which isn't surprising, it rugged 1 hour after creation). From here, I decided to look at one of the ""approve"" entries in order to see who just got blacklisted. I found something else odd: https://preview.redd.it/lrw9dtbqq35b1.jpg?width=1761&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0731fbe8b6eb3b645918a5f9bf14e201925f9d3 The name of this address is dimethyltryptamine.eth and they have $2.7 million in PEPE - oddly close to PEPE Boy. They also have a metric fuckton of Shitrugger's tokens in their wallet, most of the same ones as PEPE Boy. So what can be learned from all this? I'm still trying to sus it all out, but bottom line: Shitrugger is making a LOT of cash from these shitcoin traders, and shitcoin traders can easily afford to lose that money if just one coin takes off. If PEPE Boy spend $200 on each of the 101 shitcoins in their wallet, the cost basis overall is $20,200, but their profit is $2,395,026 because of that one PEPE swap. And with the similar amounts purchased by the two shitcoin traders, I can assume that there is a system to this shitcoin trading: spend a set amount on EVERYTHING NEW. Which also means that these scam projects will continue. Shitrugger is making a fuckton of money by volume of shitcoins created, shitcoin traders only need to get lucky once. I'm fascinated by this culture, but it greatly depresses me as well. How much are ETH gas prices impacted by this? How can anyone look at crypto favorably while this takes place? Is there any way to stop this? For those who have followed my previous posts, I've discovered a very simple but large scale shitcoin operation, and I can only image what deeds are funded by this process. If anyone has any input/theories, please leave a comment. I'm swimming in a sea of shit here. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for another chapter in this saga. Not sure where I'm going with all this, but my recommendation to all of you is to avoid doing what these degens are doing. The odds of hitting the next PEPE are astronomically small, but the odds of hitting one of Shitrugger's spawn are nigh 99% if you are buying something brand new. Stay safe out there."

Why stop DCAing into ALTs?,"Trying to get my head around all the doom and gloom posts regarding ALTs. Looking back on the last bear market, a lot of the top ALTs really didn't do much. Seems a bit like the dotcom boom in 1999 where you only needed to build a website, regardless of your core business, to get investor funds. This time around, top ALTs, even the ALTs being attacked by the SEC look to be, for a lack of a better term, doing stuff. Many of the ALTs have continued to build/progress their roadmaps all through the boom and bust. They seem to be more business focused and have actual structure compared to coins that busted previously. They have been gaining partnerships with large non web3 corporates, and basically seem much better run. So I'm just a bit confused why anyone already investing in one of most risky assets would feel they need to exit completely at a very large loss now compared to other large swings, or even when they ""invested"" in sh!tcoins like safemoon or Pepe.. Guess they believe the tokens wil alll fail? I'm a bit more hopeful for some of these larger ALTs. So will continue to DCA.

Seems a bit like the dotcom boom in 1999 where you only needed to build a website, regardless of your core business, to get investor funds. This time around, top ALTs, even the ALTs being attacked by the SEC look to be, for a lack of a better term, doing stuff. Many of the ALTs have continued to build/progress their roadmaps all through the boom and bust. They seem to be more business focused and have actual structure compared to coins that busted previously. They have been gaining partnerships with large non web3 corporates, and basically seem much better run. So I'm just a bit confused why anyone already investing in one of most risky assets would feel they need to exit completely at a very large loss now compared to other large swings, or even when they ""invested"" in sh!tcoins like safemoon or Pepe.. Guess they believe the tokens wil alll fail? I'm a bit more hopeful for some of these larger ALTs. So will continue to DCA. Would love to hear thoughts on this."

10 Amazing Tools to Help You on Your Crypto Journey,"A post yesterday asking about a tool to monitor addresses inspired me to come up with a list of some of the best crypto tools to help you navigate on-chain data and DeFi. \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # 1. DeFiLlama - The Swiss Army Knife of DeFi Currently, there is no alternative data analytics platform available in the market that offers the same level of comprehensiveness while still being completely free. With DeFiLlama, you can access every DeFi vertical (categories, unlocks, stables, volume) across almost every application today. It aims to offer insights into DeFi projects, such as total value locked (TVL), lending and borrowing statistics, trading volume, and more. Users can explore and analyze data from different DeFi platforms to gain a better understanding of the DeFi ecosystem.

[and note: I'm not referring to projects/devs with a genuine, wholistic road map that demonstrates the intention - with significant, incremental results - to help make a better world a better place. but rather I'm referencing the shady characters with only a vague or no robust road map at all and no utility. where it's a project that only seeks out riches for its founders + maybe a relatively small percentage of early adopters and/or others will be a few of the 'lucky ones.'] re: CEO's: so many of them are never background checked in even the simplest of ways, not even in the free/no money needed ways. but if they had been, beforehand, by at least 90% of its followers who gave up money, most would not have fallen for their grifts. because they wound have known, before it was too late, about those who have scammed before. sometimes they've also changed their names, even if only slightly. and these guys tend to be easy to catch by those doing their due diligence because they're arrogant & have so much hubris that they brazenly show their faces..all the while knowing full well they'll get rich again, scamming. and because they know the majority of those susceptible to their scams don't do much reading, they see them as easy marks. also, they're often playing the long game, seeing 'investors' as the product. and what they advertise will likely leave many down the line holding the bag. knowing this early can help avoid pain - or at least it lets the hopeful know to treat it like nothing more than gambling in Vegas: investors = customers/guests🎯 President/CEO = The House🏦 so, even if a few 'guests' win big, the House is always the biggest winner in many of these cases & such projects - whether it's about a long or short game - are often falling into a category called, 'meme coins.' which are, in reality, usually tokens riding on the coattails of an established already existing blockchain, such as Ethereum. but if someone insists on being involved in the world of meme coins then for sure analytics like the ones the OP included on the list above, even just one or a few of the right ones can be quite helpful."", 3), ('This is good for researching long term holds, but people knowing how to program on chain bots makes me feel like low volume trading is pointless now', 1), ('Nice post, thank you for update', 2), ('Anything else in your save folder that you care to share?', 1)]","10 Amazing Tools to Help You on Your Crypto Journey A post yesterday asking about a tool to monitor addresses inspired me to come up with a list of some of the best crypto tools to help you navigate on-chain data and DeFi. \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # 1.

I think for Pepe it was something that felt like a better time (bull run 2021), I think right place and right time and a lot of people just wanted to feel that excitement of making a profit again. I think Pepe was less market manipulation and hype by influencers at first than say how Safemoon was 100% market manipulation and influencer hype from the start. I was obviously early on Pepe...and almost all the typical NFT influencers or crypto accounts on Twitter just straight up shit on Pepe and said its a rug and it almost did an inverse Cramer effect . Where people that got wrecked in NFTs by NFTs influencers said fuck you I\'m dumping your shit and buying this. If anything I think it was more a movement of people realizing the NFT grift and how they were taken advantage of.

Fomo kicks in with those narratives. But that one trader basically won the crypto Powerball....it wont happen again anytime soon until it does ha.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development.

Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community.

Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have supply deflation and become a positive-sum investment. > In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation. > Polygon PoS distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees. > Solana collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)]. > Cardano rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years. > Bitcoin pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees. > > Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021. > > And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees. > > In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees. > > On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks. > > Competition from other Smart Contract networks (moderate): > > Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

It could have been much, much worse and from what I can tell the scam account I sent it to (literally called ""Phishing_Account_[long string of numbers and random characters]"") has reciebed roughly 20k in etherium in just the last week. Before could call me an idiot I could only see the address name after looking in my transaction details. Don't be me."
Dogecoin's Popularity Wanes As Rivals Emerge: What Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin has been facing struggles as other memecoins gain popularity, causing a significant reduction in its investor community. Despite experiencing a 20 percent spike in value year-to-date, the digital currency has dropped by approximately 5.39 percent this week, trading at around $0.084 on Friday. Other coins such as $PEPE and $WOJAK have emerged and contributed to the decline in Dogecoin's popularity. However, Dogecoin still maintains its position as one of the most traded and liquid digital assets, with around 5.4 million holders, according to on-chain data. The market for Dogecoin is still dominated by whale traders, who execute large transactions worth millions of dollars. In the past 24 hours alone, several transactions involving millions of dollars have been processed on the Dogecoin chain, demonstrating the continued influence of whale traders on the market. According to analysts, traders can expect an altcoin season in the near future, with mapped-out levels for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Despite the challenges, Dogecoin remains a popular cryptocurrency, and its performance in the market will continue to be monitored by investors and traders alike.",1,0,2023-04-21 10:42:40,dogecoin,None,"[('Dogecoin has something I\'ve never experienced with other cryptos; a deeper purpose.

Are you looking for a meme coin to invest in after the success of Pepe? Look no further than Bogdanoff, the latest meme coin taking the crypto world by storm. Here's why you should consider adding BOG to your portfolio: Firstly, the creators of BOG are the infamous Bogdanoff twins, who are known for their cryptic predictions about the future of finance and their involvement in the crypto industry. Their involvement in BOG gives it a level of credibility and legitimacy that many other meme coins lack. Secondly, BOG has a unique feature called ""liquidated locked,"" which means that a portion of the coins in circulation are locked away in a liquidity pool, ensuring that there is always a minimum value for BOG. This feature makes BOG less volatile than many other meme coins, which can experience sudden drops in value. Lastly, BOG has an impressive score of 99 on Dextools, which is a platform that analyzes and tracks the performance of various cryptocurrencies. This high score indicates that BOG has a strong community, high liquidity, and is backed by reliable data. In conclusion, if you're looking for a meme coin with a strong team behind it, unique features that make it less volatile, and impressive performance on Dextools, then BOG is definitely worth considering.

Profiting from Memecoins vs. Building a Solid Crypto Portfolio for the Long Term,"With the recent meme season, we've seen how some people were able to make quick profit by buying and selling meme coins like PEPE. While it's great to see people making money in the crypto space, it's important to remember that investing in a meme coin is about having fun and not getting in with HODL mentality like we do for altcoins. Instead of investing in memecoins, it's better to focus on altcoins with utility. These projects have real-world applications and are more likely to hold their value over time. For example, Allianceblock and Polygon developed ZKPs, which enable decentralized identity solutions for the financial industry. Curve and Aave are coming up with new innovations that are pushing the boundaries of DeFi and helping to pave the way for a more decentralized financial system. These are practical and in-demand use cases for blockchain technology that has the potential for long-term growth. Building a solid crypto portfolio with long-term holdings is a more sustainable strategy than chasing the latest meme trend. While it may take longer to see significant gains, investing in coins with real utility and a strong development team is a more reliable way to build wealth over time. As we look toward the future of the crypto market, it's difficult to predict which area will be the next focus - Gamefi, Defi, or Metaverse.

Suggestion: One name per contract Address might reduce fraud in Crypto,"Confidence is the game, build confidence and see the crypto market boom because people will be willing to invest in crypto. When you type in a certain token name on dextools, you will noticed that that same token will have different names but different contracts addresses. I understand that in a smart contract, a token can only have one contract address, a dev can create multiple tokens with the same name but each tokens will be assigned a new and unique contract addresses everytime a new token is created. As of today, contract addresses are the only ways to differentiate a token with the same name from another. What if smart contracts are updated to make sure, tokens can only be assigned one name across chains just like the way a gmail username can only be assigned to one person, then we will have only one pepe, one satoshiswap, one shiba inu and one gary across all chains. I think this new way of assigning names will give investors more trust and confidence to invest in a certain project and will reduce fraud by 90%. This type of contract will also help in protecting Intellectual properties of crypto projects and will help restore confidence. Also projects will be afraid to rug pull because once they destroy the reputation of a certain IP, the project is gone for good.

Hence, the contract is trusted and is in fact, pepe. About the token name: Currently, we are agreeing to use ERC-20 Standard for fungible tokens.

If you noticed, decentralised domains are the only place that are 90% safe from fraud, yes a scammer can create a token name that sounds similar to another token name by just changing the alphabets of a token name but they wont be able to create the exact token name as that token.

Only if you want to live in reality. Edit: But let's go further: To understand why something won't work, you need to have the mindset to break it. The best system to implement what you discuss would be a validator/voting system that verifies coins and locks names, etc. If I wanted to break this system, I'd simply look into controlling the validators. This is entirely doable and it would destroy whatever you thought you were creating. So how would we fix a takeover? A merit-based validity score? That can be manipulated. It would also be a huge undertaking. So what else could fix this? I don't think there is a mechanism in existence to curtail this behavior so that would need to be made from scratch just to prevent a bad actor from destroying your system and I doubt it would happen for 2 - 3 years."", 2), (""As far as my attitude goes, how would you feel if you had knowledge and experience and tried to help someone understand why their idea wasn't feasible - just to have them argue with you every step of the way and provide examples that don't really apply to the situation.

When you type in a certain token name on dextools, you will noticed that that same token will have different names but different contracts addresses. I understand that in a smart contract, a token can only have one contract address, a dev can create multiple tokens with the same name but each tokens will be assigned a new and unique contract addresses everytime a new token is created. As of today, contract addresses are the only ways to differentiate a token with the same name from another. What if smart contracts are updated to make sure, tokens can only be assigned one name across chains just like the way a gmail username can only be assigned to one person, then we will have only one pepe, one satoshiswap, one shiba inu and one gary across all chains. I think this new way of assigning names will give investors more trust and confidence to invest in a certain project and will reduce fraud by 90%. This type of contract will also help in protecting Intellectual properties of crypto projects and will help restore confidence. Also projects will be afraid to rug pull because once they destroy the reputation of a certain IP, the project is gone for good. What do you guys think?"

"$SWAP and $SSB Update - May 14, 2023","Hey gang, We're back with an update! [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) Beta Has Begun We are excited to share some fantastic news with you all! The beta testing of our token-tracking, price-charting platform, [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) , has officially commenced. We are about a week and a half into this crucial phase, and the progress has been encouraging. Our aspiration for [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) is not just to create another crypto tracking platform. We envision it as a thriving hub for crypto enthusiasts, where you can unearth the next high-performing tokens, participate in engaging AMA's, margin trade your favorite cryptocurrencies, and much more. We have a host of innovative features up our sleeves, and we can't wait to reveal them to you soon. For the beta phase, we have launched the following features: Comprehensive ETH and BNB chain coverage Real-time price tracking Searchability of over 1 million tokens Compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices Daily highlights of top-performing and underperforming tokens A proprietary trending algorithm Lightweight trading chart alongside a full trading view chart Record of historical trades https://reddit.com/link/13hmz2e/video/0slvs0lsvuza1/player We recognize there is work to be done in perfecting the app (we are aware of the bugs). Still, we wanted to showcase our progress and allow the community to provide feedback through hands-on experience. Priority for invites has been given to our active Telegram group members, but rest assured, we'll be dispatching more invites over the coming fortnight as we refine the platform and prepare it for full-scale production. We aim to offer a service on par with Dextools and beyond and then we'll dive into launching our unique features that no other platform currently has, as well as integrating the Satoshi Swap margin dex (next update on that coming later in the month). Note - Dextools coin has surged approximately 500% since the year's start, which highlights the IMMENSE potential in the token tracking space. And don't forget, this is only one facet of our product suite, with leverage trading coming soon and further SWAP utility being integrated into [SSB.io](https://SSB.io). Next invites are being sent out in a few days $SSB Launch (SSB Coin) and Satoshi Street Bets Reboot It's meme season baby! Unless you've been living under a rock the past 2 weeks you can't help but have noticed that meme tokens are BOOMING. It started with PEPE and we also saw two different Wall Street Bets tokens blow up... and then the flood gates opened and the meme coin casino is back in action. So... we are also thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of our official community meme token - $SSB, an integral part of the Satoshi Street Bets reboot! All DERPY holders (our previous meme token) will receive the equivalent dollar amount of $SSB automatically airdropped to their wallet, and everyone else will be able to buy in on launch. Here are the essential details: Launching this week No presale or whitelisting No artificial price inflation to benefit any party 0 transaction taxes. 0 reflections. Ethereum network deployment A fair launch on Uniswap, starting at DERPY's market cap before it was frozen All DERPY holders will receive a proportionate amount of tokens, with no extra supply creation We've been working on an update to the SSB visuals for a while, along with a new mascot and this will be rolled out later this week. And then we'll start building the hype for $SSB and revealing the website and precise launch details! So stay tuned for more updates, including the precise launch details of $SSB and our new website!
