Kitty Meme Coin,"The cryptocurrency industry has been a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. However, a new player has entered the game: meme coins. And one meme coin, in particular, is making headlines - Kitty Meme Coin. Kitty Meme Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the popular internet meme of cats. The coin has been gaining popularity in recent months, with many investors seeing it as a potential new player in the cryptocurrency industry. Some have even gone so far as to predict that Kitty Meme Coin is going to win the meme coin industry. So why has Kitty Coin been gaining so much attention? One reason is its unique branding. The coin is marketed as a fun, lighthearted cryptocurrency that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. This approach has resonated with many investors, who are drawn to the idea of a cryptocurrency that doesn't take itself too seriously. Another reason for Kitty Meme Coin's popularity is its strong community. The coin has a dedicated group of supporters who are passionate about its success. This community has helped to spread the word about Kitty Coin and has even developed its own online forums and social media channels. But can Kitty Coin really win the meme coin industry? That remains to be seen. While the coin has gained a lot of attention in recent months, it is still a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency world. It will need to continue to attract new investors and build a strong community if it hopes to compete with established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Additionally, the cryptocurrency industry is notoriously volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. While Kitty Coin has seen strong growth in recent months, there is no guarantee that this will continue. Overall, it is clear that Kitty Coin has captured the attention of many investors and has the potential to be a major player in the meme coin industry.

Decoding Crypto Memes: A Tale of Two Coins,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the depths of the cryptocurrency meme culture, exploring the enigmatic world of two particular coins that have captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Hold onto your private keys, because this post is about to get wild! In the red corner, we have the reigning meme champ, Dogecoin ($DOGE). Spawned from the legendary Shiba Inu meme, Dogecoin initially started as a joke in 2013, but has since become a formidable force in the crypto world. With a thriving community and Elon Musk as its unofficial mascot, Dogecoin has reached heights that would leave its creators in awe. In the blue corner, we have a newcomer to the crypto-meme world, Garlicoin ($GRLC). Launched in 2018, Garlicoin was inspired by the garlic bread meme that took the internet by storm. Created as a parody, Garlicoin has since built a dedicated community of followers, all sharing a passion for cryptocurrency and a love for garlicky goodness. As these two meme-laden cryptocurrencies battle for supremacy, their respective communities have been engaging in friendly banter and creative content, both online and offline. From Dogecoin-inspired graffiti to Garlicoin's garlic bread giveaways, these two coins have brought joy and laughter to many in the world of cryptocurrency. Despite their memetic origins, both Dogecoin and Garlicoin have inspired real-world projects and charitable initiatives. Dogecoin has funded NASCAR sponsorships, Jamaican bobsled teams, and even water wells in Kenya. Meanwhile, Garlicoin's community has engaged in philanthropic efforts, such as disaster relief fundraising and combating food insecurity. As we witness the ongoing duel between these two meme coins, we can't help but appreciate the levity and humor they bring to the often-serious world of cryptocurrency. So, whether you're a die-hard Dogecoin hodler or a Garlicoin connoisseur, remember that, in the end, we're all part of a larger community that shares a passion for decentralized finance and technological innovation.

How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it's not a reliable ""get rich quick"" scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin.

Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested. I know you can't predict this stuff, but I think it's still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there's always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw. I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off. I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it's now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021. Obviously it's much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL'ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE). Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. I'm not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges.

I'm just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to ""shoot to the moon"", and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they're unavailable on CoinBase.

Let's talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/) So let's talk about Doge V Shiba Inu Utility Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. On-Chain Data Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. Doge's active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba's price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/) So let's talk about Doge V Shiba Inu Utility Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. On-Chain Data Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. Doge's active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba's price."

Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections. I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated. I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space. I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime.

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future.

Aidoge sounds like a good name tho but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm. These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop.

It has grown to become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by marketcap, even surpassing Dogecoin, the first and by far the biggest memecoin since alt coins existed. This is huge because as we\'ve seen with bitcoin, the first mover advantage is huge; no other coin has come close to surpassing bitcoin yet, despite tens of thousands of coins coming to existence in recent years. > > Shiba Inu clearly has one of the largest network effects in the entire industry, which is arguably the most important metric for any crypto. > > You can easily buy Shib on platforms like Webull, so people who are not into crypto can still get in and buy shib, making it far more accessible than all but the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. > > Finally, Shib has great branding. The idea of the ""Shib Army"" and ""Shib to 1 cent"" (or even a dollar) is incredibly good marketing, because it gives the community a common identity, as well as a goal to work towards. If we take any other crypto, people might like the coin and want it to go up, but there is no singular goal that everyone can point to and talk about. Thus, people are much less likely to contribute towards the development and branding of the coin. > > Secondly, the ""shib-lingo"", with LEASH and BONE as well as other parts of the shiba inu ecosystem allows for a much more intuitive understanding of crypto for those who find it too challenging to understand and can\'t be bothered to learn about all of the ins and outs of crypto itself. It is a great gateway for complete beginners to start understanding all of the different crypto terminology in words and concepts they already understand. > > ---------------------------- > > Now in terms of misconceptions regarding value, most people think that you need to have a ""use-case"" for value. But what is a use-case? Really, a use-case is just a ""feature"". i.e they think that every coin has to have some special feature or property that other coins don\'t have in order for it to be valuable. > > This makes sense intuitively, but isn\'t how things actually work. Just because something has a unique feature doesn\'t mean that that feature is useful. For example, if you were to take YouTube\'s source code today and slightly improve the UI, you would have a ""superior YouTube"", but no one would use it. > > Network effects far outweigh any features in terms of importance. Furthermore, the idea that features have to come before value is intuitive, but actually, as we\'ve seen, because of the Shib network being adopted, there are DApps being developed on it, like wallets and exchanges to begin with, and eventually, there will probably be a lot more products and services being built on top of Shib in the future, as long as it continues to hold value. > > Because it isn\'t just feature that create value. Rather, developers chase after the money. Where there is money, where there are incentives, that\'s where people will build, and that in itself will grow the ecosystem. > > disclosure: I do not hold any SHIB and never will. * Would you like to learn more?

Buterin then decided to donate $1 billion worth to an Indian corona relief fund, leading the SHIB owners to subsequently claim some disgusting moral victory that this was somehow thanks to SHIB. Meanwhile the coin plummeted in value after this event, leading to losses for whomever sold. To this day the SHIB owners gloat that Buterin is \'a friend of SHIB\' and that \'SHIB led to that amazing donation\', pissing on the graves of all of those who lost money in the wake of that event. Meanwhile they also pretend that the most important thing about SHIB is the community. But apparently the community can go [expletive] themselves if it means the SHIB team can abuse them for some PR stunt. > > #The \'top secret\' roadmap > > Furthermore, for a coin supposedly centered around it\'s community, the SHIB team speaks of a \'top secret 2021 Ruffmap with a real budget\' that they do not elaborate on. Once more proving that the SHIB team does not care about its community, because if they did this \'Ruffmap\' would not be \'top secret\' but out in the open for the community to know about. It also leads you to wonder if this \'Ruffmap\' is even real or just an empty promise. > > #Decentralisation issues > > Another indicator of SHIB\'s empty speech about community is the [Certik audit page](https://www.certik.org/projects/shib) pointing out that the weakest link of the project is.. decentralisation. Very ironic for a project that starts off and takes pride in being ""an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building"". > > #The mysterious team > > As for the SHIB team mentioned in this post, they are nothing but a mystery. Or, as the [Coinbureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/shiba-inu\\/) review put it: > > > I\'ve seen no mention of a development team, and the founder of the token ""Ryoshi"" fully admits in his initial post on Medium that the token wasn\'t even rolled by him, but instead was created by a friend who locked half the supply in a Uniswap contract and then sent the rest to Ryoshi\'s wallet. > > One could interpret this in the sense of the SHIB community being the key focus here, but as pointed out above the SHIB team or whoever these mysterious figures are seem to care little about their community, despite their claims. > > #Technical documentation > > ERROR 404, page not found > > #Conclusion > > At best SHIB is a ship (pardon the pun) that is indeed community based, but left rudderless by the creators. What seems more likely, however, is that it\'s heavily centralised (despite their own claims) and manipulated from behind the curtains by the (probably deliberately) invisible team. > > Bonus con: their \'Woofpaper\' PDF literally [won\'t open properly](https://i.imgur.com/jkFNlnD.jpg) in my Adobe PDF reader and the Chrome browser version is laggy.

Floki Inu's Listing Skyrockets Price,"After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048. The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday. The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm. Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings. FLOKI's listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US' large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project's next goal. After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday. The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm. Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings. FLOKI's listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US' large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project's next goal. After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project's team and backers. The coin's market cap has since fallen to 116."

Why Moons will never be Top100,"So basically I've seen a lot bullish but quite delusional opinions regarding Moons, as a currency and its potential outcome. Here is my totally bearish opinion on Moons. # Why am I posting this ? A lot of people are talking about seeing Moons in the Top 100, 50 even higher sometimes. So let's get it straight, I do not believe this will ever happen. You'll hear that some shitcoins went parabolic in a few days with less holders and this could send Moons to $100 if it simply matched Doge's Market Cap or something. This is utter madness and not only delusional but showing a true lack of education about the whole ecosystem (In my opinion) # Quick reminder on Moons To make it clear, I must remind you that technically Moons are not supposed to be traded. Also, according to Reddit ToS, Moons are meant to be solely a Governance Token without monetary value. While I totally understand this is a legal stand to prevent any juridic inconvenience, people need to understand that by no means Reddit will support trading, listings or anything related to the fact people can take this governance token out of his way. This is a free market, people are able to trade it and price reflects simply the offer / demand for it. I still don't understand why anyone would want to buy Moons, but I'll get back to it later. # Not your everyday shitcoin Now let me explain why I can't see a lucrative future for Moons holders. First, while it is a shitcoin, Moons can't be compared to others with aggressive marketing campaigns like Shiba did with Vitalik, or Doge being directly pumped by Musk. You can find every example in the world, Moons have no reason to get pumped simply because they are not meant for it. You may then ask why shitcoins like BabyMuskCumBucket on the BSC will pump eventually : because this is their only purpose and people play the greater fool game trying to get in early and get out on time. # No one cares Another interesting stat : there are 6+ million people in this sub, interested in cryptos and for sure knowing about Moons, but we are not even 200K holders. This means barely 3% of the ""biggest crypto community"" care about Moons that are free. So now tell me how someone out of this sub would care more, having to buy them. # Holder repartition is a Red Flag My last point is that even if Moons were to magically pump one day, considering the distribution of wallets, there are already too much Moon whales to maintain a healthy bullrun. As soon as it would break ATH or say reach the scandalous value of $1, most whales will dump their bags and empty out liquidities everywhere. Most liquidity providers would face IL and I bet even arbitrage bots, if there's any focusing on Moons, wouldn't help. On a side note, KM is only creating artificial scarcity, thus making price moves after snapshot and distribution. It is not needed for the governance use of the token and actually penalize liquidity providers. It has been voted by whales to secure their bag and make sure most people are incentivized to hold while they can dump at anytime. # Usecase > Pump Moons value is bound to the fact it is inflationary and airdropped every month. What would be the intencive for buyers ? Why would they throw cash at it if most of the supply is owned by people who had it for free ? As a final word, I think a pump on Moons value would do more harm than good, and it needs to keep a stable value to best serve it's very purpose : governance. * I would love to hear your opinion on this, feel free to share you thoughful insights. ^(tl;dr : read it instead of rushing to comments for farming purpose)",151,536,2023-04-26 20:39:48,CryptoCurrency,MOONS 🌕,"[(""Even if we reach top 200 it would be a win.

We aren't doing enough to help promote moons as a community(and how we can change that),"Now we all know how much hype is important for the growth of a crypto project, and yet all we do here is shill them to ourselves, creating a big echo chamber while making it unlikely for the entire internet to hear about our token. I think one of the strongest points about our token is the size of the community, but unlike other shitcoin communities, we don't really spread the word about ours anywhere we go. For example, I have seen some of my irl friends have doge as their profile pic on facebook, I've personally worked as a writer for a community shiba inu website where they try to promote shib for the internet, and so on and so forth.. Also, I saw many people on reddit recruiting meme posters on 4chan about crypto projects, and some even recruit ""guerilla marketers"" , who try and push certain coins without making it obvious in crypto subs like this one. The thing is , we can do all this to help push our token and grow its adoption. Try to mention moons on crypto twitter like all shitcoin degens do. If you're a 4chan user let them know about your x10 play (moons). It isn't really unethical because I'm pretty sure moons are more of a solid investment han the DogeElonCum kind of tokens shilled around there.

Keeping a single key secret in an enterprise is a massive pain in the patootie, because an enterprise needs to be robust against any one person going zig when the enterprise zags...

After 2 years, 66% of the currencies in the list are still there. Somtimes in a different order of course. I believe this is quite a lot in a volatile market as crypto with many scams going around. &#x200B; Obvious disappearances from the list include: Terra (LUNA), FTX Token (FTT) and Celsius (CEL). Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC). * The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving. As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment! &#x200B; 1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."" 2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change. 3. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now... 4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange. 5. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT. 6. Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don't see a future for it after SEC went after it. 7. Cardano (ADA): another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software. 8. Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon! 9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues. 10. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications. 11. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data. 12. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin's cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees. 13. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance (created by Paxos), tied to USD, for now 14. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on. 15. Shiba Inu (SHIB): also dubbed ""Dogecoin killer"", basically the little meme brother 16. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable. 17. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar. 18. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It's just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications. 19. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct. 20. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an ""internet of blockchains"". 21. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 22. Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it's an exchange like Binance, just decentralized. 23. OKB (OKB): the native token of OKEx exchange. 24. Monero (XMR): if you need drugs (jokes aside, it's a coin focussed on privacy) 25. Ethereum Classic (ETC): technically the original Ethereum network 26. Internet Computer (ICP): blockchain network that aims to provide a decentralized version of cloud computing 27. Toncoin (TON): formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network. 28. Stellar (XLM): fast processing times and low fees 29. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability 30. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services. 31. Aptos (APT): A privacy-focused cryptocurrency, dubbed as ""Solana Killer"", many red flags were mentioned though 32. TrueUSD (TUSD): another stablecoin 33. Cronos (CRO): the native token of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange 34. Hedera (HBAR): a public distributed ledger that uses a hashgraph consensus algorithm 35. Lido DAO (LDO): a decentralized finance protocol that enables staking of Ethereum 2.0 36. Arbitrum (ARB): a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions (for MOONS!) 37. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): yet another blockchain platform that aims to enable decentralized applications with low fees and high performance 38. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they're using it. 39. ApeCoin (APE): a decentralized finance project (if you like bananas, try Banano instead) 40. Quant (QNT): a blockchain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks. 41. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. 42. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data. 43. Fantom (FTM): blockchain platform that enables fast and cheap transactions 44. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 45. The Sandbox (SAND): a blockchain-based virtual world, fading into the ""sands"" of time 46. MultiversX (EGLD): Previously known as ""ELROND"". Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism 47. Decentraland (MANA): A virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain 48. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave. 49. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network. 50. Stacks (STX): a blockchain platform that enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Bitcoin network.",9,22,2023-04-29 12:14:17,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC). * The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving. As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment! &#x200B; 1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."" 2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change. 3. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now... 4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange. 5. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT. 6. Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don't see a future for it after SEC went after it. 7. Cardano (ADA): another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software. 8. Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon! 9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues. 10. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications. 11. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data. 12. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin's cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees. 13. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance (created by Paxos), tied to USD, for now 14. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on. 15. Shiba Inu (SHIB): also dubbed ""Dogecoin killer"", basically the little meme brother 16. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable. 17. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar. 18. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It's just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications. 19. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct. 20. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an ""internet of blockchains"". 21. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 22. Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it's an exchange like Binance, just decentralized. 23. OKB (OKB): the native token of OKEx exchange. 24. Monero (XMR): if you need drugs (jokes aside, it's a coin focussed on privacy) 25. Ethereum Classic (ETC): technically the original Ethereum network 26. Internet Computer (ICP): blockchain network that aims to provide a decentralized version of cloud computing 27. Toncoin (TON): formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network. 28. Stellar (XLM): fast processing times and low fees 29. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability 30. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services. 31. Aptos (APT): A privacy-focused cryptocurrency, dubbed as ""Solana Killer"", many red flags were mentioned though 32. TrueUSD (TUSD): another stablecoin 33. Cronos (CRO): the native token of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange 34. Hedera (HBAR): a public distributed ledger that uses a hashgraph consensus algorithm 35. Lido DAO (LDO): a decentralized finance protocol that enables staking of Ethereum 2.0 36. Arbitrum (ARB): a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions (for MOONS!) 37. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): yet another blockchain platform that aims to enable decentralized applications with low fees and high performance 38. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they're using it. 39. ApeCoin (APE): a decentralized finance project (if you like bananas, try Banano instead) 40. Quant (QNT): a blockchain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks. 41. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. 42. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data. 43. Fantom (FTM): blockchain platform that enables fast and cheap transactions 44. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 45. The Sandbox (SAND): a blockchain-based virtual world, fading into the ""sands"" of time 46. MultiversX (EGLD): Previously known as ""ELROND"". Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism 47. Decentraland (MANA): A virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain 48. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave. 49. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network. 50. Stacks (STX): a blockchain platform that enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Bitcoin network."

Shiba Inu Investors Lose Assets to Fake Shibarium Website,,1,0,2023-04-30 01:56:38,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[],Shiba Inu Investors Lose Assets to Fake Shibarium Website
How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it's not a reliable ""get rich quick"" scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. Solana is currently worth $23.61/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021. SAND wasn't even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021. Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested. I know you can't predict this stuff, but I think it's still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there's always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw. I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off. I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it's now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021. Obviously it's much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL'ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE). Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. I'm not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I'm aware that it's more like gambling, and not a reliable way to ""get rich quick"". I'm just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to ""shoot to the moon"", and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they're unavailable on CoinBase. I couldn't even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren't allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won't allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it's perfectly fine in other risky investments). You can't tell me ALL these ""big winners"" are PURELY blind luck...... And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don't allow a lot outside of well established coins.....",27,290,2023-04-30 08:45:48,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Hello cryptdoh6.

I know it's not a reliable ""get rich quick"" scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. Solana is currently worth $23.61/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021. SAND wasn't even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021. Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested. I know you can't predict this stuff, but I think it's still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there's always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw. I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off. I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it's now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021. Obviously it's much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL'ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE). Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. I'm not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I'm aware that it's more like gambling, and not a reliable way to ""get rich quick"". I'm just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to ""shoot to the moon"", and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they're unavailable on CoinBase. I couldn't even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren't allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won't allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it's perfectly fine in other risky investments). You can't tell me ALL these ""big winners"" are PURELY blind luck...... And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don't allow a lot outside of well established coins....."

This is just sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming shitloads of shitcoins from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich. Then I saw this: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/j4qe60angjxa1.jpg?width=1509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af44502d9554e7b3edd42558ab4d6d80a58cceb $0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers.

This latest meme season has shown me Ethereum is unusable as a Layer 1 and you cannot change my mind,"Opening disclosure: I do not promote you do the same, I have a very balanced portfolio but occasionally I will throw left over money into meme hype coins just for fun. This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It all started with Meme season 2021. Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap. Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap. I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops. Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience). Follow my journey - so you won't have to! Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x. Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/18iavmbdu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=015ec783d2ecb55aafdef77fe65e5544227898e4 Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\\You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.) &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/q7svktefu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb98d3a642d489e0c69c47d6b79c811a9e02b9c3 Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lcftvtfgu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13536ae9cc585cf91b2ca81577ba24c9fd5d6715 &#x200B; Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum.

Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token.

Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network.

But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? > > Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be. > > Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions (major): > > Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions. > > These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users. > > Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption. > > Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses. > > Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers). > > ZK Rollups require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network. > > Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors (moderate): > > The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks. > > MEV and Dark Forest attacks (minor): > > [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners. > > Final Word > > Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network. * Would you like to learn more?

Bridges themselves require liquidity. Anyone can build a bridge and wrap tokens from one chain to another. So they'd have to manage to support the bridge that each wrapped token used because when an asset is bridged to one chain, it has to be locked on the parent chain and it will only unwrap a token it knows as valid - as in it's a token that was wrapped with the bridges contract.

It would be more streamlined than having 2 web pages to interact with, a DEX and a bridge, but still just as expensive and slow.

Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap. Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap. I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops. Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience). Follow my journey - so you won't have to! Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x. Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/18iavmbdu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=015ec783d2ecb55aafdef77fe65e5544227898e4 Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\\You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.) &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/q7svktefu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb98d3a642d489e0c69c47d6b79c811a9e02b9c3 Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lcftvtfgu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13536ae9cc585cf91b2ca81577ba24c9fd5d6715 &#x200B; Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum.

It has grown to become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by marketcap, even surpassing Dogecoin, the first and by far the biggest memecoin since alt coins existed. This is huge because as we\'ve seen with bitcoin, the first mover advantage is huge; no other coin has come close to surpassing bitcoin yet, despite tens of thousands of coins coming to existence in recent years. > > Shiba Inu clearly has one of the largest network effects in the entire industry, which is arguably the most important metric for any crypto. > > You can easily buy Shib on platforms like Webull, so people who are not into crypto can still get in and buy shib, making it far more accessible than all but the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. > > Finally, Shib has great branding. The idea of the ""Shib Army"" and ""Shib to 1 cent"" (or even a dollar) is incredibly good marketing, because it gives the community a common identity, as well as a goal to work towards. If we take any other crypto, people might like the coin and want it to go up, but there is no singular goal that everyone can point to and talk about. Thus, people are much less likely to contribute towards the development and branding of the coin. > > Secondly, the ""shib-lingo"", with LEASH and BONE as well as other parts of the shiba inu ecosystem allows for a much more intuitive understanding of crypto for those who find it too challenging to understand and can\'t be bothered to learn about all of the ins and outs of crypto itself. It is a great gateway for complete beginners to start understanding all of the different crypto terminology in words and concepts they already understand. > > ---------------------------- > > Now in terms of misconceptions regarding value, most people think that you need to have a ""use-case"" for value. But what is a use-case? Really, a use-case is just a ""feature"". i.e they think that every coin has to have some special feature or property that other coins don\'t have in order for it to be valuable. > > This makes sense intuitively, but isn\'t how things actually work. Just because something has a unique feature doesn\'t mean that that feature is useful. For example, if you were to take YouTube\'s source code today and slightly improve the UI, you would have a ""superior YouTube"", but no one would use it. > > Network effects far outweigh any features in terms of importance. Furthermore, the idea that features have to come before value is intuitive, but actually, as we\'ve seen, because of the Shib network being adopted, there are DApps being developed on it, like wallets and exchanges to begin with, and eventually, there will probably be a lot more products and services being built on top of Shib in the future, as long as it continues to hold value. > > Because it isn\'t just feature that create value. Rather, developers chase after the money. Where there is money, where there are incentives, that\'s where people will build, and that in itself will grow the ecosystem. > > disclosure: I do not hold any SHIB and never will. * Would you like to learn more?

ShibaSwap has gone all in on the theme, renaming staple terms to more dog centric names: stake is now bury and provide liquidity is now dig. This helps to immerse users into the ecosystem and provides a unique aspect to those involved. > > Shiba Inu also has an incubator dedicated to ""cultivating an enviromnet which encourages creativity and growth."" This incubator helps those in the community with their NFT aspirations and is a large part of their decentralization movement. > > SHIB also has a psychological advantage not many coins can replicate. This comes from the fact that their are 1 QUADRILLION coins in circulation. Having that many coins helps SHIB maintain it\'s low price and allows users to buy massive amounts of coins for a relatively small investment. While this doesn\'t really mean much in the grand scheme of things since market cap is what really matters, people are easily swayed by large numbers. > > Looking past the technicals, SHIB is a force to be reckoned with on the community front. Following Dogecoins footsteps, SHIB may have figured out the secret to quick growth and utilization: hype. It doesn\'t matter how good your product is if no one has heard of you. SHIB has gained a rabid following through the ShibArmy and taking just one look at their subreddit will show you that they have all drank the kool-aid. If they can keep this hype going, SHIB is a meme coin that will stick around for quite some time. > > Others will argue that these meme coins are a negative on the crypto space and only further the idea that this is all fake money, but it is actually the opposite. Hype leads to growing interest which leads to more users in the crypto world. Dogecoin paved the way for meme coins as an entry point for the average person, and Shiba Inu is just the next evolution of that idea. As more users flow into this space and add their fiat into the exchanges, the crypto world as a whole will continue to grow and head towards our ultimate goal of replacing the current financial system. * Would you like to learn more?

Meanwhile the coin plummeted in value after this event, leading to losses for whomever sold.

Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down.

It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme. > > Transaction speed and time > > Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use. > > Decentralization > > Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time.

It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather.""

Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin. > > Unlimited Supply > > There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code. > > Price Manipulation by Famous People > > It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages.

This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down. Have fun guys and don't forget to never spend more money gambling then you can afford to lose or are willing to lose."

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases. In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice. Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation, even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation.

Obviously there are many other options on the oracle space like Band, Api3, Dia, etc but hardly will reach ChainLink's position due to the network effect. On the oracle space this can be worrying as many have called ChainLink, the Achilles Heel of DeFi, because if it fails, +90% of DeFi dApps are compromised. These are just a few examples... but Economics 101 will teach us how bad monopolies are."", 2), ('Very well-said. I love having the variety. Sure, this makes investing more risky, but it also makes it more rewarding. Placing your faith in one project over another can absolutely reward you handsomely.', 2), (""It's all about risk appetite and how strong one conviction is."", 2), (""It's part of the decentralization, you're not stuck with a monopoly. But this isn't the original reason different coins and tokens started popping up. It has a lot to do with the architecture of the solutions these projects offer, so some projects absolutely need their own tokens. Especially, niche projects like IoT-enabling projects (Iota, Robonomics, Helium, Weaver Labs). But majority of other projects can use existing tokens but then financial renumeration would present problems. Overall, I think the current business system of the crypto world (financially), needs serious overhaul."", 2)]","Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything. Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases. In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice. Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation, even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation. If we would have 2 or 3 coins in total, we would be years backward in terms of tech and usecases."

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he's lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. However, there's more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it's a little easier to make profits in crypto. He's undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it's still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world's largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it's also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he's unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each. While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling! Edit to add: I should've titled this ""but only in there money he's lost"".

This incubator helps those in the community with their NFT aspirations and is a large part of their decentralization movement. > > SHIB also has a psychological advantage not many coins can replicate. This comes from the fact that their are 1 QUADRILLION coins in circulation.

"I can understand why SEC may want to treat the 13 mirror protocols as securities, but ...","I can understand why SEC may want to treat the 13 mirror protocols as securities, but why the regular crpto? What even strange is that while serious projects like Cardano and Algorand are being targeted by SEC, they seems to be fine with meme coins like Dodge Coin and Shiba Inu? Or is this a PoW vs. PoS situation? &#x200B; The US Securities and Exchange Commission has put the financial world on notice: It considers a range of widely traded digital assets to be securities, a position that could impose steep regulatory requirements on digital-asset exchanges. Recently announced legal actions against some of the biggest names in crypto trading will put that proposition to the test. Figuring out what does or doesn't make a coin a security is still a major point of contention. 1. What is the SEC doing? In July 2022, as part of an insider-trading case, the SEC identified nine cryptoassets that it considered to be securities. On June 6, the agency sued Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest US crypto trading platform, over allegations that it illegally listing numerous tokens. In a separate case announced a day earlier, the SEC alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. also listed unregistered securities. All told, as of June 6, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler had signaled that it considers coins worth $120 billion to be unregistered securities. The SEC has said that its securities rules apply as well to crypto staking, which offers customers a return for letting their tokens be used to facilitate blockchain transactions. 2. What does it mean for something be a security? On the simplest level, whether something is or isn't a security under US rules comes down to how much it looks like shares issued by a company raising money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Under that framework, an asset can be under SEC purview when it involves investors kicking in money with the intention of profiting from the efforts of the organization's leadership. In 2020, the agency sued Ripple Labs Inc. for allegedly raising money by selling the XRP digital token without registering it as a security. The SEC claimed that the company was funding its growth by issuing XRP to investors betting that its value would rise. The case is now a massive legal battle, with Ripple having hired a former SEC chair, Mary Jo White, as an attorney. 3. Why does calling a token a security matter? Among other things, it makes running a cryptocurrency exchange more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection requirements for platforms and issuers. That means exchanges would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in a worst case, prosecutions if criminal authorities ever got involved. Supporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors because of the SEC disclosure requirements that would apply. 4. Who's against that approach? Crypto enthusiasts say that their ventures are decentralized in a way that makes old rules a poor fit, and crypto trading platforms argue that the assets they're listing should be considered commodities, not securities. In the US, rules governing trading of commodities and their derivatives are focused more on ensuring that companies, producers and farmers can effectively hedge against risks of price swings in commodities. 5. What does the crypto community want? There have been efforts on Capitol Hill to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives watchdog, more power to regulate cryptoassets directly. Currently it primarily oversees crypto futures and has the ability to take enforcement action if there's fraud or manipulation in the underlying market, as it has in dozens of crypto cases. The CFTC's regulatory regime is considered less onerous than the SEC's, so it's little surprise that the crypto crowd wants to be overseen by the CFTC. In 2022, crypto executives and titans of traditional markets like Citadel Securities joined an industry push behind a bill from top lawmakers on the Senate Agriculture Committee that would give the derivatives regulator more turf - at the expense of the SEC. That effort stalled after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was one of the most vocal companies pushing for the change. More recently, two key House Republicans proposed giving authority to the CFTC to oversee certain tokens and create a pathway for coins that begin as securities to eventually be regulated as commodities. 6. What coins are and aren't considered a security? Beyond the very biggest cryptocurrency, there's a lot of ambiguity. US regulators including the SEC agree that Bitcoin, which is by far the largest digital asset, isn't a security. It was started by an unknown person or persons going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and does not exist as a way to raise money for a specific project. The second-biggest token, Ether, was deemed not to be a security during President Donald Trump's administration; a senior SEC official signaled that while it may have started out as a security - the Ethereum Foundation used it to raise money - it had grown into something sufficiently decentralized that it probably no longer was one. But after Ethereum changed to a system in which coins that are ""staked"" play a role in recording transactions, Gensler said that the fact that staked coins can earn interest might lead regulators to start treating it as a security. The CFTC, however, deems Ether a commodity. 7. Is this an issue elsewhere? Yes. Globally, different regulators have taken a range of positions on whether to treat cryptocurrencies as securities. The UK's Financial Conduct Agency regulates digital assets it considers investments that come with rights to repayment or a share in profits, while ""payment tokens"" like Bitcoin or ""utility tokens"" that provide access to a service are unregulated. Singapore regulates both types but under different laws. It considers coins that are digital representations of other assets, such as unlisted shares, to be securities. European lawmakers in April approved a law imposing common cryptocurrency rules across all 27 member states and calling for a new legal framework to regulate public offers of cryptoassets. • A Treasury Department report on issues related to crypto regulation. • A look at the crypto industry's push in Washington to avoid securities regulation. • Gary Gensler's first interview on crypto after taking over as SEC chair with Bloomberg Businessweek. • A BGOV OnPoint of cryptocurrency legislation being considered by Congress. • A Bloomberg QuickTake from 2018 shows how long these fights have been going on for. • The executive order on crypto regulation signed by Biden. • An article on the SEC's fight with Ripple. • The UK FCA's breakdown of regulated versus unregulated tokens. --With assistance from Ben Bain.",1,0,2023-06-11 14:53:45,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Thank you for submitting to /r/CryptoCurrency, Your post has been removed because the topic you posted about (SEC) is already at the limit of posts allowed in the top 50.

How and Why I came into Investing in $SSB (Previously known as Derpy) and #SatoshiSwap (Might take around 3 to 4 mins of your reading time).,"In late 2020, a friend of my introduce me to the world of Cypto. It took me a few weeks of researching what was it all about and the various coins on the market. I made my 1st purchase in Doge on Feb 3rd 2021 at around $0.04 (FYI I miss my initial entry in Dec 2020 when prices were below 1 cent as I was still not comfortable in investing in Crypto) and subsequently into Shiba Inu, Safemoon, ...etc. I have to be frank I was quite lucky in a sense that I got in early before the real pumps came in and overall made 10x what I put in after offsetting the losses in some shit coins and con jobs (using the 4 points written below). Along the way I refined the basis of of my entries after going into Wall Street Bets and subsequently by chance into Satoshi Street Bets. It was here that I came to set up my personal ""Crypto Investment Philosophy"" or ""CIP"" as I would like to call it 1) Coins with real world utility or striving towards it; 2) Coins backed by Strong Communities (hardcore); 3) A team of dedicated founders and developers; and 4) Good trading volume Along the way I notice a frequent person posting known as Little Eagle and little did I know that that person was actually David Gilbert the founder of this group until subsequently (FYI I was scanning daily through this reddit group and a couple of others for coins meeting my 4 criteria) so one day he mentioned that he wanted to come up with his own brand of Coins with some utility of a margin trading Dex so I decided to keep in view the developments. As the weeks pass by in 2021 and more details were released I come to a decision to invest into Derpy and Swap and did the Whitelisting and KYC and participated in Copper Launch (FYI I did not sleep for almost 48 hours by checking the prices every 30 mins as I am very careful of where I put my money into, I even made a forecast of the price decay and it was almost 95% correct and happy to say I bought in at almost the bottom when the volume and prices started deviating from my forecast.). The actual reasons for me to invest was due to the very stringent criteria needed to buy the coins and the reasoning David gave which was not like those pump and dump coins where whales swoop in and then sell, rekting the small fishes. I studied the entire whitelisting process, search on Diamond Hands Consulting Pte Ltd, the Law firm appointed, ...etc And so the journey started, along the way certain elements of the Margin Trading Dex were altered and deadlines were pushed but it was all explained in a transparent fashion and boy did the evolution of the utility products evolved into a more sophisticated product then what was initially mentioned. Over the months the numbers of Wen Moon/ lambo boys came down and the telegram group was left with a group of dedicated investors. Its frankly very heartening to see David and the developers continuing to build over the crypto winter. The money gained during presale is still around and not rugged and you can check it in the blockchain yourselves. Around late 2022, David came and told us that he had won a lawsuit against the fake SSB coin. I took it up and started searching for whatever information that is publicly available and came across the court proceedings at the New York Circuit Court, the name of the Judge, the Trademark applications and the various jurisdictions the Trademark has been applied for. This put me in a position where my trust in David and the team has risen up a few notches as you know litigations are not a small matter and to have the dedication to see it through and win makes it even more admirable especially is that it was won in America where there is a lot of bias towards crypto recently with operation chock point 2 in progress.

I believe PEPE the frog and all pepe inspired meme tokens will be where most of the profit will be made in the next bull market. In the last bull market, Shiba inu and dogs inspired meme tokens were the talk of the town, many traders made lot of profit from Shiba and dog related meme tokens. Now is the time for pepe and every pepe ( frog) inspired meme token, pepe has already paved the way with its volume and marketcap, that already has sent a signal that there are lot of traders who believe in pepe, it is also signaling that the next bull market will be all about frog meme tokens. I confidently believe frogs will be the animal for the next bull run, let's see how it goes."

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021. Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago. Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility? Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors. Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market. The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market.

Exchanges were lining up to list ICP, On May 10, 2021, it got to an ATH of $700.65, the coverage was massive, marketcap was worth $100 billion, ICP was going to disrupt cloud computing giants like AWS and Google Cloud.it was heaven on earth, those who bought early, couldnt believe their eyes, they were paper millionaires. One morning, rumours started spreading that DFINITY the founders of ICP, has dumped billions of dollars worth of tokens while also barring its early investors from exiting their positions. Price fell from $700 to $500, those who were watching at the sidelines, saw it as an opportunity to get it for cheap, then it fell to $200, then $30, supporters said it was just a correction, so new people bought in hoping to make all time high again. After the price fiasco, some researchers did some analysis, it was noticed that Dfinity treasury and project insiders deposited 18.9 million ICP, worth ~$3.6 billion at time of deposit, to Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, and OKEx and that 94% of the 8.3 million in ICP deposits from the Treasury to exchanges occurred on two days: 3.1 million on May 10th (listing day) and 4.7 million on June 15th.
