Kitty Meme Coin,"The cryptocurrency industry has been a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. However, a new player has entered the game: meme coins. And one meme coin, in particular, is making headlines - Kitty Meme Coin. Kitty Meme Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the popular internet meme of cats. The coin has been gaining popularity in recent months, with many investors seeing it as a potential new player in the cryptocurrency industry. Some have even gone so far as to predict that Kitty Meme Coin is going to win the meme coin industry. So why has Kitty Coin been gaining so much attention? One reason is its unique branding. The coin is marketed as a fun, lighthearted cryptocurrency that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. This approach has resonated with many investors, who are drawn to the idea of a cryptocurrency that doesn't take itself too seriously. Another reason for Kitty Meme Coin's popularity is its strong community. The coin has a dedicated group of supporters who are passionate about its success. This community has helped to spread the word about Kitty Coin and has even developed its own online forums and social media channels. But can Kitty Coin really win the meme coin industry? That remains to be seen. While the coin has gained a lot of attention in recent months, it is still a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency world. It will need to continue to attract new investors and build a strong community if it hopes to compete with established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Additionally, the cryptocurrency industry is notoriously volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. While Kitty Coin has seen strong growth in recent months, there is no guarantee that this will continue. Overall, it is clear that Kitty Coin has captured the attention of many investors and has the potential to be a major player in the meme coin industry. However, only time will tell whether it can sustain its momentum and truly come out on top.",1,0,2023-04-20 09:20:56,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1)]",kitty meme coin cryptocurrency industry hot topic recent years rise bitcoin ethereum cryptocurrencies however new player entered game meme coins one meme coin particular making headlines kitty meme coin kitty meme coin cryptocurrency based popular internet meme cats coin gaining popularity recent months many investors seeing potential new player cryptocurrency industry even gone far predict kitty meme coin going win meme coin industry kitty coin gaining much attention one reason unique branding coin marketed fun lighthearted cryptocurrency easy use accessible everyone approach resonated many investors drawn idea cryptocurrency doesnt take seriously another reason kitty meme coins popularity strong community coin dedicated group supporters passionate success community helped spread word kitty coin even developed online forums social media channels kitty coin really win meme coin industry remains seen coin gained lot attention recent months still relatively new player cryptocurrency world need continue attract new investors build strong community hopes compete established players like dogecoin shiba inu additionally cryptocurrency industry notoriously volatile prices rising falling rapidly kitty coin seen strong growth recent months guarantee continue overall clear kitty coin captured attention many investors potential major player meme coin industry however time tell whether sustain momentum truly come top,0.02

Decoding Crypto Memes: A Tale of Two Coins,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the depths of the cryptocurrency meme culture, exploring the enigmatic world of two particular coins that have captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Hold onto your private keys, because this post is about to get wild! In the red corner, we have the reigning meme champ, Dogecoin ($DOGE). Spawned from the legendary Shiba Inu meme, Dogecoin initially started as a joke in 2013, but has since become a formidable force in the crypto world. With a thriving community and Elon Musk as its unofficial mascot, Dogecoin has reached heights that would leave its creators in awe. In the blue corner, we have a newcomer to the crypto-meme world, Garlicoin ($GRLC). Launched in 2018, Garlicoin was inspired by the garlic bread meme that took the internet by storm. Created as a parody, Garlicoin has since built a dedicated community of followers, all sharing a passion for cryptocurrency and a love for garlicky goodness. As these two meme-laden cryptocurrencies battle for supremacy, their respective communities have been engaging in friendly banter and creative content, both online and offline. From Dogecoin-inspired graffiti to Garlicoin's garlic bread giveaways, these two coins have brought joy and laughter to many in the world of cryptocurrency. Despite their memetic origins, both Dogecoin and Garlicoin have inspired real-world projects and charitable initiatives. Dogecoin has funded NASCAR sponsorships, Jamaican bobsled teams, and even water wells in Kenya. Meanwhile, Garlicoin's community has engaged in philanthropic efforts, such as disaster relief fundraising and combating food insecurity. As we witness the ongoing duel between these two meme coins, we can't help but appreciate the levity and humor they bring to the often-serious world of cryptocurrency. So, whether you're a die-hard Dogecoin hodler or a Garlicoin connoisseur, remember that, in the end, we're all part of a larger community that shares a passion for decentralized finance and technological innovation. And now, for the quote that will have you questioning everything you've just read: ""Why did the cryptocurrency cross the blockchain? To get to the other side...of the meme economy.

How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it's not a reliable ""get rich quick"" scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. Solana is currently worth $22.62/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021. SAND wasn't even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021. Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested. I know you can't predict this stuff, but I think it's still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there's always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw. I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off. I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it's now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021. Obviously it's much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL'ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE). Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. I'm not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I'm aware that it's more like gambling, and not a reliable way to ""get rich quick"". I'm just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to ""shoot to the moon"", and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they're unavailable on CoinBase. I couldn't even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren't allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won't allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it's perfectly fine in other risky investments). You can't tell me ALL these ""big winners"" are PURELY blind luck...... And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don't allow a lot outside of well established coins.....",1,1,2023-04-21 06:45:07,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('hello cryptdoh looks like might found new scam please report scam crossposting rcryptoscams rcryptoscamreport visiting scamalertio tips avoid scams click bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subredditmessagecomposetorcryptocurrency questions concerns', 1), ('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1), ('need get lucky different gambling', 1)]",spot next big coin buy early enough know reliable get rich quick scheme people actually gotten rich pretty quickly coins never even meant taken serious like dogecoin solana currently worth sol may shot mindblowing november sand wasnt even yet end reached november people made thousands millions yes probably much rare dollars initially invested know cant predict stuff think still better bet buying lottery tickets least hodl indefinitely meaning theres always chance skyrocket later unlike lottery ticket expires draw far purchased coinbase allow sale many brand new coins still tons fall already crypto plan hodl longterm numbers barely change daily basis even bitcoin started fractions penny reaching end first month people said stupid scam high april obviously much exciting get rich matter months rather years even worse decades already crypto specifically dedicated longterm hodlng ada algo matic xlm hbar million shiba course worth little even doge passive boring though life fly wait im trying sink thousands probably even hundreds dollars crypto yet centralized exchanges im aware like gambling reliable way get rich quick im asking find coins determine likely shoot moon actually purchase hold theyre unavailable coinbase couldnt even buy bitgert brise binance bitmart arent allowed sell state big brother wont allow risk money certain things perfectly fine risky investments cant tell big winners purely blind luck even actually purchase know buy crypto coinbase dont allow lot outside well established coins,0.12

Let's talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/) So let's talk about Doge V Shiba Inu Utility Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. On-Chain Data Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. Doge's active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba's price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('ping verified users associated payments uatlosio bot

Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections. I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated. I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space. I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away. Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future. I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm. These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget. Is any of this project worth investing cos I guess Shiba Inu and Doge seem to start in this similar fashion some of didn't take it seriously",2,72,2023-04-23

My Trust Wallet was Compromised while staking my shibs,"Hi fellow community members, my trust wallet was compromised while i was staking my shibs. I want to close the account and open a new account. But my issue is what shud i do with my staked coins. I searched wallet hack while staking, but i cudn't find any post explaining what to do with the stake coins.

Floki Inu's Listing Skyrockets Price,"After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048. The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday. The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm. Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings. FLOKI's listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US' large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project's next goal. After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project's team and backers. The coin's market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('listing', 1), ('usual listing big exchanges results pumps thats see', 1), ('always say im going invest meme coins stuff like happens', 1), ('whos gon na jump provide liquidity insiders selling launch scam happens daily kucoin alone people still fall', 0), ('heres shill shit coin know exit liquidity people bought listing exchange right', 1), ('jump provide liquidity insiders unloading launch', 3), ('rugpull loading', 7), ('stop giving shit coins attention', 2), ('stop giving insiders liquidity', 2), ('stuff like happens daily exchanges like kucoin pump dump works buy spike watch slowly correct back insiders sell liquidity provide', 1), ('tale old crypto shitcoin community dreams binance listing shitcoin actually listed binance shitcoin hodlers think rally binance listing shitcoin dumps pretty much immediately following binance listing floki hasnt dumped yet coming guaranfuckingteed', 2), ('may go tomorrow even whale sell shitcoins moved whale makes centralized entities cases whales dump insiders', 1), ('way need chasing meme coins btc', 1), ('really giving attention memecoins thats gambling investment', 2), ('lot wowwww imagine', 1), ('short', 1), ('quick like lightening', 1), ('well said fuck shitcoins', 1), ('moron nope dont care', 1), ('hahaha', 2), ('already dumpingits right', 1), ('pepe doge floki hot topic nowadays dont know people want lose money', 2), ('real pump hasnt happened yet', 1), ('hope shitcoins listed moons listed one day', 1), ('rugpullexe found', 3), ('day happiest person moon', 1), ('rocketing cant see zeroes dude', 1), ('aaaaaaaand', 1), ('op said retraced looool', 1), ('mention dogelon mars thats real sleeper', 2), ('stop giving nice chomp guys', 0), ('error project integrity found', 3), ('binance listing make doge killer', 1), ('remember rockets tend explode thats good outcome board', 2), ('error content', 3), ('sell news', 1), ('like floki dropped nice nft worth eth holding thought rugged waiting entry pump earlier year', 0), ('lets see next week', 1), ('another great day casino', 1), ('', 2), ('posts allowed yet educational posts coins seen shilling get removed', 0), ('discussion people think', 2), ('looked coinmarketcap trading price range past days yeah skyrocketing lmao', 1), ('tokens projects list pick', 1), ('stand delisting', 1), ('chompo gang', 2)]",floki inus listing skyrockets price euphoria subsided price retraced press time according coinmarketcap coin reached intraday high floki team argued launch binanceus deposits endorsed project consummated meme coin trilogy consisting doge shib binanceus listed floki announced usd usdt spot trading pairs coin tuesday move likely result bad blood tamadoge tama community whose token fell announcement bybit would list token rather binance us arm listings boost credibility even wellknown coins floki inu joins dogecoin shiba inu dogthemed coins trusted exchanges tamadoge pepe babydoge yet secure credible listings flokis listing binanceus american branch binance significant binanceus large trading volumes floki gain visibility importantly credibility given difficulty getting binance binanceus listing securing coinbase binance listings seem projects next goal listing announcement token entered top cryptocurrencies market cap ascent marked significant achievement projects team backers coins market cap since fallen,-0.087

Why Moons will never be Top100,"So basically I've seen a lot bullish but quite delusional opinions regarding Moons, as a currency and its potential outcome. Here is my totally bearish opinion on Moons. # Why am I posting this ? A lot of people are talking about seeing Moons in the Top 100, 50 even higher sometimes. So let's get it straight, I do not believe this will ever happen. You'll hear that some shitcoins went parabolic in a few days with less holders and this could send Moons to $100 if it simply matched Doge's Market Cap or something. This is utter madness and not only delusional but showing a true lack of education about the whole ecosystem (In my opinion) # Quick reminder on Moons To make it clear, I must remind you that technically Moons are not supposed to be traded. Also, according to Reddit ToS, Moons are meant to be solely a Governance Token without monetary value. While I totally understand this is a legal stand to prevent any juridic inconvenience, people need to understand that by no means Reddit will support trading, listings or anything related to the fact people can take this governance token out of his way. This is a free market, people are able to trade it and price reflects simply the offer / demand for it. I still don't understand why anyone would want to buy Moons, but I'll get back to it later. # Not your everyday shitcoin Now let me explain why I can't see a lucrative future for Moons holders. First, while it is a shitcoin, Moons can't be compared to others with aggressive marketing campaigns like Shiba did with Vitalik, or Doge being directly pumped by Musk. You can find every example in the world, Moons have no reason to get pumped simply because they are not meant for it. You may then ask why shitcoins like BabyMuskCumBucket on the BSC will pump eventually : because this is their only purpose and people play the greater fool game trying to get in early and get out on time. # No one cares Another interesting stat : there are 6+ million people in this sub, interested in cryptos and for sure knowing about Moons, but we are not even 200K holders. This means barely 3% of the ""biggest crypto community"" care about Moons that are free. So now tell me how someone out of this sub would care more, having to buy them. # Holder repartition is a Red Flag My last point is that even if Moons were to magically pump one day, considering the distribution of wallets, there are already too much Moon whales to maintain a healthy bullrun. As soon as it would break ATH or say reach the scandalous value of $1, most whales will dump their bags and empty out liquidities everywhere. Most liquidity providers would face IL and I bet even arbitrage bots, if there's any focusing on Moons, wouldn't help. On a side note, KM is only creating artificial scarcity, thus making price moves after snapshot and distribution. It is not needed for the governance use of the token and actually penalize liquidity providers. It has been voted by whales to secure their bag and make sure most people are incentivized to hold while they can dump at anytime. # Usecase > Pump Moons value is bound to the fact it is inflationary and airdropped every month. What would be the intencive for buyers ? Why would they throw cash at it if most of the supply is owned by people who had it for free ? As a final word, I think a pump on Moons value would do more harm than good, and it needs to keep a stable value to best serve it's very purpose : governance. * I would love to hear your opinion on this, feel free to share you thoughful insights. ^(tl;dr : read it instead of rushing to comments for farming purpose)",151,536,2023-04-26 20:39:48,CryptoCurrency,MOONS 🌕,"[('even reach top would win

We aren't doing enough to help promote moons as a community(and how we can change that),"Now we all know how much hype is important for the growth of a crypto project, and yet all we do here is shill them to ourselves, creating a big echo chamber while making it unlikely for the entire internet to hear about our token. I think one of the strongest points about our token is the size of the community, but unlike other shitcoin communities, we don't really spread the word about ours anywhere we go. For example, I have seen some of my irl friends have doge as their profile pic on facebook, I've personally worked as a writer for a community shiba inu website where they try to promote shib for the internet, and so on and so forth.. Also, I saw many people on reddit recruiting meme posters on 4chan about crypto projects, and some even recruit ""guerilla marketers"" , who try and push certain coins without making it obvious in crypto subs like this one. The thing is , we can do all this to help push our token and grow its adoption. Try to mention moons on crypto twitter like all shitcoin degens do. If you're a 4chan user let them know about your x10 play (moons). It isn't really unethical because I'm pretty sure moons are more of a solid investment han the DogeElonCum kind of tokens shilled around there. That way we can have a domino effect and have the media covering us ,more people buying our token, and eventually more cex listings and positive price action.

Why cryptocurrency will never be better than fiat (opinion),"First and foremost I am a meme stock trader, and I have so much Doge it hurts. So I want to make sure yall understand the level of legitimacy of which my stock/crypto/asset portfolibro exists. Now this is all in light hearted fun folks. I like both fiat and crypto. But what happens if the internet goes down? What happens if a country's bitcoin mining facilities get blown up during a war? What if I can't access my Doge??? Now I'm not saying banks are going to screw us over anyway lol what I'm saying is: at least for now, if the internet went down, I could go and withdraw fiat money. Or, if you're a silly goose like me and hide cash underneath the uh....I mean.....nevermind..... This is of course an open discussion. I would love more insight from those of you who actually know what you're talking about. Also I want to recognize how crypto is definitely worth it in the long run for stability, transferring funds super quick, etc. Not trying to shill out in crypto. Just sparking some discussion.

"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each with a short explanation (04/2023)","I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) post of 2 years ago and thought it would be interesting to update this for the situation today. After 2 years, 66% of the currencies in the list are still there. Somtimes in a different order of course. I believe this is quite a lot in a volatile market as crypto with many scams going around. &#x200B; Obvious disappearances from the list include: Terra (LUNA), FTX Token (FTT) and Celsius (CEL). Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC). * The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving. As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment! &#x200B; 1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."" 2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change. 3. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now... 4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange. 5. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT. 6. Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don't see a future for it after SEC went after it. 7. Cardano (ADA): another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software. 8. Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon! 9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues. 10. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications. 11. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data. 12. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin's cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees. 13. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance (created by Paxos), tied to USD, for now 14. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on. 15. Shiba Inu (SHIB): also dubbed ""Dogecoin killer"", basically the little meme brother 16. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable. 17. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar. 18. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It's just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications. 19. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct. 20. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an ""internet of blockchains"". 21. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 22. Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it's an exchange like Binance, just decentralized. 23. OKB (OKB): the native token of OKEx exchange. 24. Monero (XMR): if you need drugs (jokes aside, it's a coin focussed on privacy) 25. Ethereum Classic (ETC): technically the original Ethereum network 26. Internet Computer (ICP): blockchain network that aims to provide a decentralized version of cloud computing 27. Toncoin (TON): formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network. 28. Stellar (XLM): fast processing times and low fees 29. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability 30. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services. 31. Aptos (APT): A privacy-focused cryptocurrency, dubbed as ""Solana Killer"", many red flags were mentioned though 32. TrueUSD (TUSD): another stablecoin 33. Cronos (CRO): the native token of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange 34. Hedera (HBAR): a public distributed ledger that uses a hashgraph consensus algorithm 35. Lido DAO (LDO): a decentralized finance protocol that enables staking of Ethereum 2.0 36. Arbitrum (ARB): a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions (for MOONS!) 37. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): yet another blockchain platform that aims to enable decentralized applications with low fees and high performance 38. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they're using it. 39. ApeCoin (APE): a decentralized finance project (if you like bananas, try Banano instead) 40. Quant (QNT): a blockchain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks. 41. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. 42. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data. 43. Fantom (FTM): blockchain platform that enables fast and cheap transactions 44. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 45. The Sandbox (SAND): a blockchain-based virtual world, fading into the ""sands"" of time 46. MultiversX (EGLD): Previously known as ""ELROND"". Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism 47. Decentraland (MANA): A virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain 48. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave. 49. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network. 50. Stacks (STX): a blockchain platform that enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Bitcoin network.",9,22,2023-04-29

"""Community"" Meme/shitcoins are cults and damaging to mental health","Meme/shitcoin communities are cults and damaging to peoples mental health, yeah its true... especially to the mental health of youth. As funny as it may sound it's actually true, we live in a economy where it might be uncertain whether or not you will even be able to buy or rent a house/apartment some day. People will look at anything that can potentially make them money and fomo in. There are so many shitcoin projects and ""memecoin"" projects getting major exposure on social media as well as general media. This gets young people not understanding the risks of investment in these coins to invest mayor funds. You can call them dumb, but really is it their fault when they are so so desperate to make some money to make it in life? As media will say 1000x in just a week! People will fomo in and be basically held hostage by the so called ""community"" and gas fees and those bs ""tokenomics"". Saying don't fear just Hodl. Really? Hodl what? A token with literally 0 utility? The same thing is any other ""community"" token? The ""communities"" of these tokens are so deep into this whole scheme that they will say anything is fud even if it is the truth. And will say just hodl! Whilst watching their money go down the drain. These coins are literally all designed to lure people in and keep them captive, no rugpull needed. Focus and invest in real projects and other blockchains, not shit meme tokens that wont make you any money. It is literally insane to me thet shiba inu is number 15 on cmc based on market cap.

"Be careful with ""Meme Coin Season"" FOMO.","It's back! No not the bull market, not defi summer, not alt coin season, its not even nft's are back season. Its simply good old meme aka shit coin season. It is back and in full force and you degens better be prepared to not be sucked in to dumb coins that are most likely going to leave you with empty bags. Sadly this is a reality for so many. We all remember during the good ol covid days how the beloved squid games token was born, one day went up and the next day went down like a bag of bricks. Well that is exactly what is going to happen to many people with this new overly hyped up ""meme coin season"" Truth is there have been very few meme coins that have with stood the test of time with shiba inu being one of them. For some reason some how when doggy token craze was in full effect shiba inu who was born with 10 zeroes managed to knock of 6 zeroes making a lot of people a lot of money. That was once in a blue moon scenario. Are we going through another blue moon phase? Maybe. But all that would mean is that of the 25-50 meme coins released over the past 2 weeks maybe and only maybe one will be around a year or 2 from now in the top 25, 50 or even top 100 by market cap. It is very difficult for these ""projects"" and I use the word projects loosely to be successful over time. It takes a lot of hype from a community to stir up the pot enough to get millions of users to buy in and fomo. All I am saying is be smart and be cautious. A lot of these meme coins have unknown devs. These tokens / contracts / websites can be made in a matter of an hour by someone no one knows nothing about who could be anywhere in the world. The fear of empty bags is one thing. The fear of malicious contract interaction draining your wallet to zero should terrify you. I am not going to mention any of the recently born meme coins. If you want in and want to play the high risk high reward game that is up to you. My duty here is to remind you all that 99% of all who buy these specially in a bear market end up rekt.

Real talk? I'm sad I missed it (can I say that?),"So much hatred and vitriol. So many people warning against it. And probably rightfully so, eventually. Perhaps. And maybe it won't rug. Maybe it'll do a Shiba Inu. Who knows. It's a damn green frog so it'll hop where it wants to right? But I wonder how much of the hate is just envy? Because honestly, yeah I'm feeling a bit of the green. I'm glad I managed my degenerate instincts but I could have tripled some degen money as well if I'd played. So yeah, I don't disagree with the warnings. Most of these do rug. But I also am not ashamed to be honest. Even tho i know its probably best that I counter these urges. I wonder how many feel the same? Show of hands? And is it taboo to admit to wanting to be in on the ride in here?

This is just sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming shitloads of shitcoins from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich. Then I saw this: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/j4qe60angjxa1.jpg?width=1509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af44502d9554e7b3edd42558ab4d6d80a58cceb $0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers. But less than a penny? Of course, lets look at that gas fee. PEPE volume has been insane lately, so I just knew I was gonna see some pain. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/t7t6n63ogjxa1.jpg?width=1567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36846f33e7c1b0c15d8a353a044860c1684c1f3a That's right folks. Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words. Now lets have a look at this poor soul's transaction history: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/sbe6x0sogjxa1.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=074e78fc8d10ed33d5056c603ad84c8e31dc3db5 Two transactions total. Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows. At this point, it's just sad. This is like watching someone shoot up meth. Friends, please don't DEFI and drive.

Shitcoin platforms?,"I AM NOT LOOKING FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE I can make my own decisions, if they are wrong then that is on me. Stop with the financial advice. So I saw the post here warning people off of shitcoins and naturally I want to do the opposite. Have a job where I do a lot of manual labour for peanuts so I thought what better way to try and make a little extra change each week. Where does everyone start with their shitcoin gambles? Any tips on where to go to gauge sentiment? I'm completely fine with losing $5-10 here and there it really does not bother me. I'm not looking to make millions, just something to make me feel less shitty about my low paid job 😂 I saw pepe before it mooned but I had no idea how to buy it so I've just been watching from the sidelines.

TRON and SHIBA INU are top 15 coins. How can we take the crypto market seriously like this?,"According to Coinmarketcap TRON sits at spot 13 and SHIBA INU at spot 15. If that's not bad enough, we have DOGE at 8, SOL, which is down more than it is running, at 10! Also, Tether, USDC and BNB... To be honest, at the current stage it seems to me 95% of coins in the market has no real utility or intrinsic value. What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How can people not see the crypto market like a large online betting site when everything gains value from short time speculation and manipulation and when the price isn't really correlated with the quality of the product. It's just all the hype (looking at you PEPE). Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever.

This latest meme season has shown me Ethereum is unusable as a Layer 1 and you cannot change my mind,"Opening disclosure: I do not promote you do the same, I have a very balanced portfolio but occasionally I will throw left over money into meme hype coins just for fun. This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It all started with Meme season 2021. Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap. Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap. I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops. Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience). Follow my journey - so you won't have to! Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x. Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/18iavmbdu4ya1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=015ec783d2ecb55aafdef77fe65e5544227898e4 Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\\You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme.

"Crypto is open and (mostly) decentralised, which means that people can do whatever they want. It will never follow any ideology, however reasonable.","Hi everyone, I just need to get this off my chest. There are so many rants about meme coins in this sub. Users are patting each other on the back and everyone seems to know what crypto is supposed to be. Do I think tokens like Shiba INU or that new frog coin are a total gamble? Yes. Do I think we need to change that? No! Open and decentralised doesn't mean you will get it your way. It doesn't mean that we have to follow its inventor Satoshi, he's not Jesus and the bitcoin whitepaper is not the bible (looking at you, r/ bitcoin). Another example for that principle is democracy. In my country, people are outraged by far-right parties in our parliaments. Well, that's democracy, people. There's no point in protesting against a party that has been elected into our government, you should rather educate people and make your country a better place. The same goes for crypto: if you have a good project with real utility then it will eventually succeed. Frog coin owners will sit on their bags and move on to the next gamble - or they will end up with BTC, ETH and a few other tokens they believe in, just like many of us.",8,65,2023-05-06

Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down.

What wallet and Defi apps do you recommend?,"I'm a college student that doesn't have much to invest but I might save up a bit every now and then. I used to use Metamask and Pancake swap for the shitcoin season when Shiba was the thing. Right now, most of my money is in CEX like crypto.com or revolut but I would like to move it to my wallet and stake it in DEX. I won't be needing money soon so I really just want to have somewhere to stake BTC and ETH and have some alts like CRO and DOT and add little money to them every week/month. Revolut seems very comfortable and user-friendly for doing little DCA but I don't like their staking system and I'd rather have it in my personal wallet. As you can probably tell, YES I am still confused with concepts and stuff so any guidance / recommendation / advice would be very helpful.

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases. In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice. Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation, even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation. If we would have 2 or 3 coins in total, we would be years backward in terms of tech and usecases.",22,47,2023-05-15 17:05:31,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('two coins btc eth anyway multiple coins good

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 3. Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 6. Meme Coins - (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap). 8. Liquid Staking Tokens (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap). This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he's lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. However, there's more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it's a little easier to make profits in crypto. He's undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it's still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world's largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it's also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he's unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each. While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling! Edit to add: I should've titled this ""but only in there money he's lost"". I hope it's clear from this post that I think he's a huge manipulator and a problem for our crypto space.

Gensler sues American Kennel Club for promoting dogs,"Gary Gensler at the SEC announced today a new lawsuit against the American Kennel Club (AKC). The suit alleges that the Kennel Club played the major role in promoting and breeding Shiba Inu's and other dogs, from which a large number of crypto tokens - unregistered securities - have been inspired and developed. These have included Dogecoin, Baby Doge, BONK, Nano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Safe Inu, 'and a bunch of other shitcoins.' Gensler was quoted as saying, ""their dogs may be cute, but the Kennel Club needs to come in, sit down with us and register their organization if they want to keep breeding and showing canines, particularly the Inu varieties, as they've been the main reason that the evil of crypto meme coins even exists."" ""These coins and tokens have bred out of control, much like the mongrels that the American Kennel Club loves so much. They need to start taking responsibility for misleading the American public by pretending that they don't have a role in this."" In response, a confused AKC had immediately delisted Shiba Inu breed from its list of recognized dogs, and announced that they would be moving their headquarters to the United Arab Emirates.",1,0,2023-06-10 16:08:17,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY,"[('bearish security dogs rough days ahead ks', 9), ('nobody stop madman gary gensler', 3), ('know comedy post gensler lost every credibility moment knew applied binance advisor board', 2), ('whole industry going shake ks deemed unregistered security dogs likely subject us sanctions', 3), ('good bitcoin', 1), ('gensler sues aubreys wig store due confusion real faux fur claims connections outside wig production feeding leads labor regulated within us guidelines aubreys wig store made colorful accusations towards investigators genitals violent confrontation wig counter suing damages done two acrylic nails', 2), ('almost believed', 4), ('followed wig industry rug industry hit nation wide sec suit folds leaving consumers choice install vinyl planks manage combover', 2), ('yes good', 1), ('everything danger', 2), ('malinois left chat', 7), ('gensler definitely gon na invade poland', 4), ('go buy x leverage akc', 1), ('dam shitzu every time bite ankles loud fuck', 1), ('fact blockchain teacher shilled algorand disqualified long ago', 2), ('cryptskrieg attack', 2), ('need sell mine fast go cats', 2), ('gary dog loves barking wagging tail white collars', 2), ('gary gensler nobody knows next', 1), ('gary gitler', 2), ('way biased', 1), ('gensler type guy sue nose finding unregistered booger claim whatever fuck wants courts decide', 2), ('throws frisbee malinois comes flying back chat', 7), ('accurate', 5), ('scientific fact malinois never let frisbee touch ground', 6), ('medals give literally dog tokens gallows', 2), ('rule suitable titles flairs rule titles satire comedy posts must begin tag satire see expanded rules page details rule sub rules expanded rules site rules', 1)]",gensler sues american kennel club promoting dogs gary gensler sec announced today new lawsuit american kennel club akc suit alleges kennel club played major role promoting breeding shiba inus dogs large number crypto tokens unregistered securities inspired developed included dogecoin baby doge bonk nano dogecoin shiba inu safe inu bunch shitcoins gensler quoted saying dogs may cute kennel club needs come sit us register organization want keep breeding showing canines particularly inu varieties theyve main reason evil crypto meme coins even exists coins tokens bred control much like mongrels american kennel club loves much need start taking responsibility misleading american public pretending dont role response confused akc immediately delisted shiba inu breed list recognized dogs announced would moving headquarters united arab emirates,-0.8

"I can understand why SEC may want to treat the 13 mirror protocols as securities, but ...","I can understand why SEC may want to treat the 13 mirror protocols as securities, but why the regular crpto? What even strange is that while serious projects like Cardano and Algorand are being targeted by SEC, they seems to be fine with meme coins like Dodge Coin and Shiba Inu? Or is this a PoW vs. PoS situation? &#x200B; The US Securities and Exchange Commission has put the financial world on notice: It considers a range of widely traded digital assets to be securities, a position that could impose steep regulatory requirements on digital-asset exchanges. Recently announced legal actions against some of the biggest names in crypto trading will put that proposition to the test. Figuring out what does or doesn't make a coin a security is still a major point of contention. 1. What is the SEC doing? In July 2022, as part of an insider-trading case, the SEC identified nine cryptoassets that it considered to be securities. On June 6, the agency sued Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest US crypto trading platform, over allegations that it illegally listing numerous tokens. In a separate case announced a day earlier, the SEC alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. also listed unregistered securities. All told, as of June 6, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler had signaled that it considers coins worth $120 billion to be unregistered securities. The SEC has said that its securities rules apply as well to crypto staking, which offers customers a return for letting their tokens be used to facilitate blockchain transactions. 2. What does it mean for something be a security? On the simplest level, whether something is or isn't a security under US rules comes down to how much it looks like shares issued by a company raising money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Under that framework, an asset can be under SEC purview when it involves investors kicking in money with the intention of profiting from the efforts of the organization's leadership. In 2020, the agency sued Ripple Labs Inc. for allegedly raising money by selling the XRP digital token without registering it as a security. The SEC claimed that the company was funding its growth by issuing XRP to investors betting that its value would rise. The case is now a massive legal battle, with Ripple having hired a former SEC chair, Mary Jo White, as an attorney. 3. Why does calling a token a security matter? Among other things, it makes running a cryptocurrency exchange more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection requirements for platforms and issuers. That means exchanges would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in a worst case, prosecutions if criminal authorities ever got involved. Supporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors because of the SEC disclosure requirements that would apply. 4. Who's against that approach? Crypto enthusiasts say that their ventures are decentralized in a way that makes old rules a poor fit, and crypto trading platforms argue that the assets they're listing should be considered commodities, not securities. In the US, rules governing trading of commodities and their derivatives are focused more on ensuring that companies, producers and farmers can effectively hedge against risks of price swings in commodities. 5. What does the crypto community want? There have been efforts on Capitol Hill to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives watchdog, more power to regulate cryptoassets directly. Currently it primarily oversees crypto futures and has the ability to take enforcement action if there's fraud or manipulation in the underlying market, as it has in dozens of crypto cases. The CFTC's regulatory regime is considered less onerous than the SEC's, so it's little surprise that the crypto crowd wants to be overseen by the CFTC. In 2022, crypto executives and titans of traditional markets like Citadel Securities joined an industry push behind a bill from top lawmakers on the Senate Agriculture Committee that would give the derivatives regulator more turf - at the expense of the SEC. That effort stalled after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was one of the most vocal companies pushing for the change. More recently, two key House Republicans proposed giving authority to the CFTC to oversee certain tokens and create a pathway for coins that begin as securities to eventually be regulated as commodities. 6. What coins are and aren't considered a security? Beyond the very biggest cryptocurrency, there's a lot of ambiguity. US regulators including the SEC agree that Bitcoin, which is by far the largest digital asset, isn't a security. It was started by an unknown person or persons going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and does not exist as a way to raise money for a specific project. The second-biggest token, Ether, was deemed not to be a security during President Donald Trump's administration; a senior SEC official signaled that while it may have started out as a security - the Ethereum Foundation used it to raise money - it had grown into something sufficiently decentralized that it probably no longer was one. But after Ethereum changed to a system in which coins that are ""staked"" play a role in recording transactions, Gensler said that the fact that staked coins can earn interest might lead regulators to start treating it as a security. The CFTC, however, deems Ether a commodity. 7. Is this an issue elsewhere? Yes. Globally, different regulators have taken a range of positions on whether to treat cryptocurrencies as securities. The UK's Financial Conduct Agency regulates digital assets it considers investments that come with rights to repayment or a share in profits, while ""payment tokens"" like Bitcoin or ""utility tokens"" that provide access to a service are unregulated. Singapore regulates both types but under different laws. It considers coins that are digital representations of other assets, such as unlisted shares, to be securities. European lawmakers in April approved a law imposing common cryptocurrency rules across all 27 member states and calling for a new legal framework to regulate public offers of cryptoassets. • A

"TuzkiEth, new meme token, with the potential to rival Doge and Shiba","Hello Reddit and Crypto Meme Lovers. Get ready for a crazy twist in the Tuzki universe! You all know Tuzki, that adorable bunny meme that makes us laugh, right? Well, here's the deal: Tuzki now has its very own token called TuzkiEth on the Ethereum blockchain. And guess what? The original creator is completely clueless about it! Can you believe the bunny drama that's about to unfold? 😂 Let me fill you in on the details: While the Tuzki creator was busy spreading joy with their cute bunny, some sneaky crypto enthusiasts decided to create TuzkiEth-a token that's gaining popularity faster than Tuzki munches on carrots! Now, before you start worrying about any legal stuff, let's just assume that the original creator is cool with this unexpected turn of events. I mean, who wouldn't want their meme to have its very own crypto, right? It's like Tuzki is taking over the financial world one hop at a time! But hey, just in case the original creator feels left out or confused, let's show them some love. How about rewarding them with some Tuzki tokens? It's only fair, considering that Tuzki's success wouldn't have been possible without their initial brilliance. So, let's spread the word and suggest this idea to the TuzkiEth creators. Maybe they could send a cool bunny-themed care package with carrots, Tuzki plushies, and a bunch of Tuzki tokens. It's a win-win situation! Imagine this: Tuzki and TuzkiEth teaming up like the ultimate bunny duo. Tuzki continues to make us laugh with its funny expressions, while TuzkiEth takes us on an exciting crypto adventure. We could trade Tuzki-themed NFTs, swap tokens like bunnies hopping around, and who knows, maybe even have a Tuzki-themed decentralized exchange. The possibilities are endless, just like Tuzki's cuteness! Remember, this post is all in good fun. We're here to enjoy the hilarity and embrace the chaos. Let's unite as a community and see where this TuzkiEth journey takes us! Disclaimer: This post is purely for entertainment purposes.

I promised to the family I try to fix it ( I thought it ́s an easy assembling job but I didn ́t know the parts are literally broken). I wrote a list for them what I need to repair on the bike ( cost 100-150 €) but They said it ́s too much money but they wouldn ́t accept my money but I know the bike is very important for the boy, So ladies and gentleman I found my old PHYSICAL DOGECOIN and I would like to sell it just for as much as it gonna cover the repair cost. So if someone would donate or buy the coin from me please let me know. Of course I ́m gonna send the receipt from the parts and pictures how the repair goes.

How and Why I came into Investing in $SSB (Previously known as Derpy) and #SatoshiSwap (Might take around 3 to 4 mins of your reading time).,"In late 2020, a friend of my introduce me to the world of Cypto. It took me a few weeks of researching what was it all about and the various coins on the market. I made my 1st purchase in Doge on Feb 3rd 2021 at around $0.04 (FYI I miss my initial entry in Dec 2020 when prices were below 1 cent as I was still not comfortable in investing in Crypto) and subsequently into Shiba Inu, Safemoon, ...etc. I have to be frank I was quite lucky in a sense that I got in early before the real pumps came in and overall made 10x what I put in after offsetting the losses in some shit coins and con jobs (using the 4 points written below). Along the way I refined the basis of of my entries after going into Wall Street Bets and subsequently by chance into Satoshi Street Bets. It was here that I came to set up my personal ""Crypto Investment Philosophy"" or ""CIP"" as I would like to call it 1) Coins with real world utility or striving towards it; 2) Coins backed by Strong Communities (hardcore); 3) A team of dedicated founders and developers; and 4) Good trading volume Along the way I notice a frequent person posting known as Little Eagle and little did I know that that person was actually David Gilbert the founder of this group until subsequently (FYI I was scanning daily through this reddit group and a couple of others for coins meeting my 4 criteria) so one day he mentioned that he wanted to come up with his own brand of Coins with some utility of a margin trading Dex so I decided to keep in view the developments. As the weeks pass by in 2021 and more details were released I come to a decision to invest into Derpy and Swap and did the Whitelisting and KYC and participated in Copper Launch (FYI I did not sleep for almost 48 hours by checking the prices every 30 mins as I am very careful of where I put my money into, I even made a forecast of the price decay and it was almost 95% correct and happy to say I bought in at almost the bottom when the volume and prices started deviating from my forecast.). The actual reasons for me to invest was due to the very stringent criteria needed to buy the coins and the reasoning David gave which was not like those pump and dump coins where whales swoop in and then sell, rekting the small fishes. I studied the entire whitelisting process, search on Diamond Hands Consulting Pte Ltd, the Law firm appointed, ...etc And so the journey started, along the way certain elements of the Margin Trading Dex were altered and deadlines were pushed but it was all explained in a transparent fashion and boy did the evolution of the utility products evolved into a more sophisticated product then what was initially mentioned. Over the months the numbers of Wen Moon/ lambo boys came down and the telegram group was left with a group of dedicated investors. Its frankly very heartening to see David and the developers continuing to build over the crypto winter. The money gained during presale is still around and not rugged and you can check it in the blockchain yourselves. Around late 2022, David came and told us that he had won a lawsuit against the fake SSB coin. I took it up and started searching for whatever information that is publicly available and came across the court proceedings at the New York Circuit Court, the name of the Judge, the Trademark applications and the various jurisdictions the Trademark has been applied for. This put me in a position where my trust in David and the team has risen up a few notches as you know litigations are not a small matter and to have the dedication to see it through and win makes it even more admirable especially is that it was won in America where there is a lot of bias towards crypto recently with operation chock point 2 in progress. I have to admit that I have been interested and invested in this project way before the 99% who came in recently and have seen the progress made over year. To those new investors, currently the progress of the Charting Platform is in its final Beta form and quite a number (more then 50 of them as far as I am aware) of the regulars at the SatoshiSwap telegram has been testing it although I do feel a tad disappointed not to have been one of them but hey thats life and you can't always be at pole position. As for the Dex as far as I know is that it has gone through 2 audits and is almost ready to be integrated with the Charting Platform. I read thoroughly through the 1st Audit Report and the minor issues found. Overall the final product is almost coming to fruition and the bull market is almost upon us, its like Crypto spring at the moment and the products and integration is almost on hand. You should really go read up at [https://ssbcoin.com/](https://ssbcoin.com/) and [https://satoshiswap.net/](https://satoshiswap.net/) for more information related to the 2 coins.

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021. Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago. Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility? Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors. Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market. The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market. If i was you, i would sell all my low liquidity tokens at loss or forget about them and prepare for the next bull market.",20,46,2023-06-19 09:50:22,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion 🦍,"[('stupid post yeah

ICP: The greatest disaster of 2021 bull run,"Internet computer (ICP) was the poster boy of the 2021 bull run, it was launched by a swiss non profit organisation called Dfinity in the start of the bull market,the founder Dominic Williams was called by the world economic forum, the next king of the blockchain, it got lot of support from VC firms, they raised about $166 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. During that period Shiba and co were also trending, but ICP was the most successful utility project, ICP got lot of free coverage because lot of people believed in it, it was the darling of 4 chan forum, they told everyone they could tell that ICP will displaced Ethereum. Exchanges were lining up to list ICP, On May 10, 2021, it got to an ATH of $700.65, the coverage was massive, marketcap was worth $100 billion, ICP was going to disrupt cloud computing giants like AWS and Google Cloud.it was heaven on earth, those who bought early, couldnt believe their eyes, they were paper millionaires. One morning, rumours started spreading that DFINITY the founders of ICP, has dumped billions of dollars worth of tokens while also barring its early investors from exiting their positions. Price fell from $700 to $500, those who were watching at the sidelines, saw it as an opportunity to get it for cheap, then it fell to $200, then $30, supporters said it was just a correction, so new people bought in hoping to make all time high again. After the price fiasco, some researchers did some analysis, it was noticed that Dfinity treasury and project insiders deposited 18.9 million ICP, worth ~$3.6 billion at time of deposit, to Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, and OKEx and that 94% of the 8.3 million in ICP deposits from the Treasury to exchanges occurred on two days: 3.1 million on May 10th (listing day) and 4.7 million on June 15th. So it was an organized scheme to dump on retail investors. The result of the analysis spread far and wide, panic shook the heart of die hard ICP fans, but they still believe,then the end came, ICP pumped no more, in a bull market, a token has crashed massively. Many retail investors panic and sold. those who believe in it and those who bought at the top are still holding. On Aug. 9, 2021, Roche Freedman LLP, a law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against the Dfinity Foundation, Dfinity USA Research LLC and Dominic Williams, in federal court in California. The lawsuit alleges that Dfinity, the company behind Internet Computer, misled investors into believing that Dfinity and its insiders would not - and could not - sell their ICP tokens on May 10, 2021, the day that ICP first became tradable on exchanges, or in the weeks that followed. In reality, as alleged, Dfinity and its insiders could - and did - sell massive amounts of ICP during that period, thus securing substantial profits for themselves at the expense of outside investors, while causing the price of ICP to collapse. Presently ICp is trading at $3.40, those who bought at the top are hoping that ICP can do some magic and beat its ath in the next bull run. They will go on to form a community on various social media platforms telling the world that ICP will be great again.",30,10,2023-06-23 10:18:03,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion 🦍,[],icp greatest disaster bull run internet computer icp poster boy bull run launched swiss non profit organisation called dfinity start bull marketthe founder dominic williams called world economic forum next king blockchain got lot support vc firms raised million andreessen horowitz polychain capital period shiba co also trending icp successful utility project icp got lot free coverage lot people believed darling chan forum told everyone could tell icp displaced ethereum exchanges lining list icp may got ath coverage massive marketcap worth billion icp going disrupt cloud computing giants like aws google cloudit heaven earth bought early couldnt believe eyes paper millionaires one morning rumours started spreading dfinity founders icp dumped billions dollars worth tokens also barring early investors exiting positions price fell watching sidelines saw opportunity get cheap fell supporters said correction new people bought hoping make time high price fiasco researchers analysis noticed dfinity treasury project insiders deposited million icp worth billion time deposit coinbase binance huobi okex million icp deposits treasury exchanges occurred two days million may th listing day million june th organized scheme dump retail investors result analysis spread far wide panic shook heart die hard icp fans still believethen end came icp pumped bull market token crashed massively many retail investors panic sold believe bought top still holding aug roche freedman llp law firm filed classaction lawsuit dfinity foundation dfinity usa research llc dominic williams federal court california lawsuit alleges dfinity company behind internet computer misled investors believing dfinity insiders would could sell icp tokens may day icp first became tradable exchanges weeks followed reality alleged dfinity insiders could sell massive amounts icp period thus securing substantial profits expense outside investors causing price icp collapse presently icp trading bought top hoping icp magic beat ath next bull run go form community various social media platforms telling world icp great,-0.8
