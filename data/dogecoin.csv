What are some promising cryptos and why?,"I am going to start buying crypto again for the next bullrun, which may or may not already be here. I am looking for some suggestions for what to buy. Like most of us here, I am in it for the money, but I would like to know what crypto has promising tech and why/ what genuine use case it has. I believe a genuine use case would attract possible investors. I am looking for crypto that may not be in the top 10 but has potential but also the top 10, if you think they'll stay there and why. As far as use cases go, I can see positives for the following at the moment: BTC as a store of value. Scarce, finite supply. XMR for privacy (looking at its long term chart, it's price movement isn't great) Doge for currency as it has a set amount mined every year, so it's not too scarce and can be used as currency. The downside I can see to doge is that it is a meme.

Crypto Religions,"Bitcoin: Judaism, the original Old Testament from Satoshi Nakamoto (or Yahweh), rigid set of rules, almost cultish, has few sects: Pharisees: Bitcoin cash, Sadducees: Bitcoin Satochi Vision...who all think they're the only truth. Ethereum: Christianity, Vitalik (or Jesus) modified and enhanced Satochi's Old Testament to include a whole new set of possibilities and options. However a reformation happened, and Ethereum was split in two: Ethereum Classic/Catholicism is the old traditional Ethereum, and Ethereum/Protestantism is the new and reformed one. Then there are a bunch of other religions and prophets, here are a few: \- Polkadot: Hinduism, there is a creative entity that inhabits everything called Brahma or Relay Chain, and a variety of other deities specialized in specific tasks called parachains. \- Cardano: Islam, a religion/crypto isolated from the issues of the modern day, with fanatic followers that would bite your head off if you criticize their religion or prophet Charles. \- Doge: or Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a religion that makes fun or other, more serious religions and doesn't take itself seriously at all. \*Additions from comments \- Atheists are no-coiners or butt-coiners, they don't believe in a any cryptocurrencies. \- Safemoon: Scientology, a scammy business disguised in space exploration and sci-fi robes.

"Nasty FTX backdoor dealings involving AMC stock, Doge and LedgerX","This is a cross-post from robotwizard_9009... I have evidence that Robinhood, w/ Jump Trading, tokenized our stonks with FTX for Melvin Firstly, it's important to know that Jump Trading is the crypto arm of RH and the largest holder of dogecoin.. Jan 25th 2021 : Citadel and Point72 give Melvin Capital $2.5b Jan 26th, FTX tokenized our stonks onto Solana and Wrapped Eth with Jump Trading and Binance. Jan 27th, Melvin ""closes"" their positions.. or.. hedges on FTX with up to 100x leverage. Jan 28th, Blockfolio(owned by FTX) tokenized yet another copy of our stonks on eth, into bridges across the crypto landscape. One of those bridges is RenDoge. Doge pumps and media declares doge a ""memecoin"". I'll say it right now, there was no such thing as ""memecoins"" Our stonks now exist in 4 places.. out tradfi, and at least 3 mirrors in crypto. The price crashes and Melvin makes a killing on an overlevered short position. Feb 1st, Elon Musk calls Vlad Feb 2nd, FTX officially partners with Ren Bridge. Dogecoin was never a ""memecoin"".. there's no such thing as ""memecoins"" Dogecoin is inneffecient. Later, SBF is suspected to be the creator of shibu inu. I suspect he made Floki for Elon as well. These were laundry devices. I suspect the end client was XRP Ripple. The official partner of the World Economic Forum, which Ken Griffin sits on the board. It has recently come to my attention that XRP gave FTX over $10m .. and are claiming FTX owes them $93m. XRP is now looking at purchasing FTX assets. Whether that be tokenized stonks.. or I suspect, LedgerX. LedgerX is the only approved perpetual swaps in the USA. Approved by Heath Tarbert, previous admin appointed CFTC chair who joined Citadel less than 27 days of leaving CFTC. He's now Citadels Cheif Legal Advisor. Not only did he approve LedgerX, but he rolled back gary genslers clause in the Dodd Frank Act for foreign swaps reporting. Tarberts signature can be found on a foreign swaps with FTX in mid 2021. LedgerX was close door auctioned last week by Sullivan and Cromwell, who shouldn't be allowed to manage FTX due to conflicts. Who bought LedgerX? To top it off, Metaplex is a combo of Citadel and Jump Trading personel. They minted Degenerate Apes. A rip off of the memestock ape community. Highly suspicious. All of this. I suspect Michael Jordan is the secret VC behind Metaplex and was rumored to sell his NBA franchise to Melvin. He lost over $500m in the memestock event. He just auctioned a pair of Nike last week for $2m.. Melvin just came back from the dead to be a clearing firm starting last monday.Monday.. the day before the LedgerX auction. Jump Trading was involved in the Terra Luna, Mirror Protocol fraud. This was centered around mAssets or Mirrored securities. These were tokenized stock products. Specifically.. tokenized memestocks. This was not only securities fraud, but wirefraud and laundering. Another suspect is LayerZero, whom SBF gave $30m. LayerZero came up with technology that puts smart contracts into basic messages. Once an asset is held in perpetuity, whether on eth, Solana or ledgerX perp swaps... they can mint an infinite supply of mirrors on any connected or bridged chain. This can directly or indirectly manipulate the underlying. They also coded a backdoor for their clients. This involves andreeson horowitz, a16z, point72 and citadel. This is bigger than anyone knows. Oh yea.. I also recently caught Citadel acting as a searcher and validator on the Solana blockchain. Jump trading runs Pyth, an oracle system. Jump and citadel are validating trades on solana and attacking the system with MEV bots to frontrun orders and do order packing. If you are validating trades and providing oracle price feeds, this can directly manipulate prices. Pyth is also specifically designed to allow bogus feeds without disrupting the system. Some data providers were showing our stonks a few thousand dollars away from base, or Trading at 0. Tick tock.. apes aren't leaving. Mismarked short positions are hidden in swaps. They used crypto and swaps to hide from regulators and authorities. DERIBIT handles %100 of solana options and %97 of btc and eth. Paradigm clears those trades. In an interview. Ken griffin talks about how evil crypto is. Less than 2 months later, he's partnering over $1.15b with Paradigm and Sequoia. SBF also gave over $30m to Paradigm and $30m to sequoia. All of this had to go through Deribit. RAY if the FTX bankruptcy had to claw back money and assets from Deribit during the FTX crash and specifically.. the hack that took place that week. Genesis, voyager, FTX markets.. when they say digital ""assets"".. they likely mean counterfeit, tokenized securities. All of this gives SEC authority over crypto markets. All of it. These goons committed more securities violations than most James Bond Villains.

"Twitter wants to become the ""Everything App"" - whats in store for Doge?","Twitter is aiming to become the ""Everything App"" in the future. Twitter will also give users the option to buy and sell stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets at the click of a button. eToro CEO Yoni Assia told CNBC the deal will help better connect the two brands, adding that in recent years its users have increasingly turned to Twitter to ""educate themselves about the markets."" If this is something Twitter could achieve it would make Twitter easily one of the biggest companies to date.

"Controlled DCA advice and the Curious Case of ""Inverse FOMO""","It was March 2021, we were only a few weeks away from my grandma sporting her brand new Doge shirt and your taxi driver handing out killer crypto advice. Memes aside, I soon found out I was a pro at buying high and selling low. After each, fucking, drop. I FOMOed onto the crypto wagon when we were well on our way to last bull market's ATH. And my FOMO, when BTC hit 69k, was hard. One cycle of bagholding later now, I've learned my lessons. I lost some money on bad investments (metaverse coins and much worse, anyone?) but sticking around really paid off. Personally I'm lucky to have finally hit break even again. I really hope most of you are or will do so soon. That early silly FOMO behaviour turned into wisdom and its name was ""DCA"". I thank our sub with some inspiring contributions for it too. DCA has been my motto now and I've been feeling very good about it. Putting in that fixed amount each month now for over a year, not looking at the charts anymore after and I'm happy to report I'm almost at 1 Eth/0.1 BTC now thanks to this ""one little trick"". But, here's the thing. I found it super easy and laidback to DCA during those ridiculously low bear market prices of last year (the famed 16k - 24k range). It really was such a steal. And now with rising pricelevels again, I'm getting nervous. I'm having cold feet about continuing my monthly discipline and even skipped last month's DCA. Yes, 30k just doesn't feel cheap enough anymore to fully buy at (jokes on me, I used to buy BTC at 60k lol). I think I've developed the total opposite of FOMO, something like ""Fear Of Buying At High prices"". FOBAH, just not that catchy. So we all know trying to time the market is a very bad idea. But I'm toying with the idea of scaling back my DCA slowly, the more prices rise. I feel like I've become numb to seeing the market crash to bottom prices, and instead I only see opportunity at sub 25k, whereas I get nervous now that we might be at the start of a new cycle. I hear myself thinking ""damn, I'm late"" and I'm just increasing my average buy-in price too much now. After all, even with the bitcoin halving upcoming I believe too that we will break ATH, but there's no way to tell if the historical cyclical trend will keep on repeating itself. And we're all familiar with the infamous Shakespearian saying here at r/cc about what we actually do know, right? So I'm looking for an open discussion, advice as I think it can help me and many other relatively newer investors. \- Has anyone had experiences with ""controlled DCA"", or do you think it defeats the purpose of DCA? \- Have you been buying at a fixed amount under a certain price level and then scaled back your DCA-amount now that it's going up? (as an example: you DCA at 100% or 100$ when BTC < 26k and at 85% or 85$ around 30k levels) You'd have to be consistent and stick to it, and with inflation levels affecting most of us it might not even be possible at all to keep up with that fixed amount of our timely DCA that we once, determinedly, had set for ourselves. So feel free to share your experience with mitigating the risk of DCA at higher price levels or if you can relate to this ""inverse FOMO""-feeling too now. Let's have an open dicussion for crypto investors of different experience-levels, we can help each other be more aware of the psychological traps of some investment decisions, for better or worse, if we stick together and advice each other.

"As a relative newb, who is reinvigorated by the crypto space, I'm excited for the future... how about you?","Relative newb here - but here's why I'm excited. But first some black story ... I've been holding since around may 2021. Admittedly, I got into it because of doge. I had been aware of crypto and initially wanted to buy some BTC early on, but was too technologically inept. So as Doge hype came in early 2021, I remembered I once was interested and figured why not, so I learned how to buy dodge on Binance and had some fun. Eventually after that all died down and I made a little cash, I invested it all in BTC and ETH and have enjoyed taking profits when I can with those. I toyed with different alts for a while, played with trading and then came the crash. I kept my coins in, believed in BTC and eth and let it ride. Today: the past few months have me reinvested. The market is showing signs of healthy growth and the ETH update went great. I have been toying with an AI trading bot making small amounts every day which will add up over time. But beyond crypt - there is so much to be excited about. With chatGPT 4 getting so much talk, I can't help but think this will help fuel the crypto sphere not only because it will help by furthering the technology and software necessary for mass adoption, but as well as getting people excited about emerging technologies again. In addition, seeing the excitement around Reddit gen3 avatars is a big sign. I bought my first NFT because of it and don't even feel silly about it. It has real use value. I love my little avatar and already can't wait for gen4 to get more to mix and match with. The Reddit avatars really are a relatively unique, shall we say, limited, piece of art that has actual use value on a popular platform, not like some of the stupid images than can just be screen capped and used. Finally, while this is a bit tongue in cheek, I can't help but find it interesting that the rise in crypto market coincides with the fall of traditional banks. ETH with its nearly guaranteed 4% return on staking is really a big threat to the banking industry as we know it. I donno, maybe I'm just high, but I think there are exciting things for crypto headed our way in the next few years. As a newb who really is mostly just interested in the world and how it operates and engaging with new things and not necessarily someone who has a deep and vested interest in cryptos success necessarily one way or another, I just can't help but feel like if I'm recognizing this utility again, there's something in the zeitgeist that says crypto is coming back into vogue.

This is how the Gary Gensler from the SEC decides which token to attack next for being a security,"Ever had the feeling that the SEC randomly chooses which cryptocurrency to attack for ""being a security""?

Whichever cryptocurrency he pops is alleged to be a security. So this is your opportunity to find out which cryptocurrency will be coined a security next.

Timeline of Musk crypto until the recent bear market,"We pretty much all know what happened with this guy after the bull run, but I made some research to remind myself of what was happening pre-doge with him. I remember a lot of people here being excited with Musk shilling Ethereum. But, as we all know, because he is a man-child, he took the Doge freeway. Here a interesting timeline. &#x200B; In 2014, Elon Musk mentioned in an interview that he owned Bitcoin but only a small amount that someone gave him years ago. In February 2021, Elon Musk added ""#Bitcoin"" to his Twitter bio, which led to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price. In March 2021, Tesla announced that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its products.

"1 year on, Florida crypto-themed restaurant closes doors","This is a story of Crypto Street Restaurant which was based in Florida. I take most of my information from their Instagram handle @ cryptostreetrestaurant and certain other news articles/reddit posts. I will avoid putting any links in the post but if anyone wants any sources for any of this, I'll be happy to provide links in the comments. Crypto Street Restaurant had their grand opening on December 9th 2021. They received some media attention, particularly for their crypto theme and having such dishes as Doge Dog and Bitcoinana Split and claiming to accept all crypto. One such example: https://preview.redd.it/v8thls8v1tua1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7e1a29d12503c8a733683560fadd612c1de5d4 Many posts about this were made on this subreddit and the opinions were mixed. Some in the comments hailed this as a big step towards mass adoption while others described this as cringe. &#x200B; At one point, the restaurant also received some attention due to being the interview place for this person accepting cryptocurrency donations for their campaign: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0e9r3gxp5tua1.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3280d95b05be4c00802f6232b244ecf4d72f985a So, it is clear that by this point, most of the attention this restaurant had received was for being a crypto friendly place. But, the million-dollar question is, what about adoption? Did it help to drive up crypto adoption in any way? Were any payments actually made in crypto? Which crypto? And how many? Now, while the restaurant has unfortunately not released any official numbers on this, it is very easy to discern this from their Instagram feed. The reason is that they posted a picture of the customers who paid in crypto. There have been exactly 3 such posts: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/zy0yeqvt7tua1.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=681b53eb9c99eef25aa32446e9a23e59fda1b3ae &#x200B; [Don't miss the Bitcoin pillow in the back](https://preview.redd.it/jlq813iv7tua1.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5de734996a3a35ba2b70b16621945cd1658fb64) &#x200B; [Visible more clearly here](https://preview.redd.it/3aefa5zw7tua1.jpg?width=644&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20ffdce5503acc9cf87257bf5d1d7c40e782c942) So, going by this metric, throughout a year, they had 3 payments using BTC, which is clearly abysmal. Some might argue that they could've had other transactions that they didn't post pictures of, which I can't deny, but I feel that the fact that they even posted these pictures had to mean that this was a fairly rare occurrence. Either way, we have no way of making any claims conclusively unless someone can figure out their wallet address from the bar codes and check their transactions. &#x200B; Even if we leave apart the customer's choice of payments, the owners took great care to make the decor and the vibe of the restaurant crypto themed, but out of all the pictures posted on Instagram of their price boards, not in a single one is the price in BTC or in any other crypto ever mentioned. Here's an example: &#x200B; [Fiat as far as the eye can see](https://preview.redd.it/mthcfdo79tua1.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8ea23e910b4d1096ac6b6c63b545bd3eaa1a6c3) Finally, on March 2nd 2023, they posted this: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/wiu1o7x2atua1.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2e81aea3e35010973b9108ba4d4f96c106a0c88 Now, why any restaurant succeeds or closes down is not something that I am capable of commenting on, much less this particular one. In fact, this restaurant had a Google Maps rating of 4.8 over 84 reviews at the time of writing, so it seems that their patrons were reasonably satisfied with them. This post is not to put anyone down or point fingers, this is just a case study of an attempt at crypto adoption. So is there a moral to this story? I'm not sure, but I sure hope this is of interest to some people on the sub and sparks some discussion.",21,35,2023-04-19 09:59:55,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('ping verified users associated payments

"Which alt coins are showing early signs that they might be popular in the next bull market? Which ones are gonna struggle? Which ones are gonna make a big come back, and which ones will tumble? A look at what to keep an eye on before the alt market wakes up from its slumber:","# Intro: These aren't my favorite coins, nor the best coins, nor all my holdings (see disclosure at the bottom). They are the alt coins I can see the market jumping on, sometimes for all the wrong reasons. I don't have a crystal ball, but I have been in this market for many years and many cycles. And I'm starting to get an idea of what the market likes to jump on, what mistakes it likes to repeat, and type of coins attract hype. &#x200B; # What I think the popular alt coins under BTC, ETH, and USDT will be in the next bull run: To preface, frankly I was disappointed by this list. There's only 1 coin I really like on this list. But I objectively went with what I think OTHER PEOPLE would eat up. And yes, people don't always make the best choices. &#x200B; 1.Matic 40% sure This is probably my boldest prediction. I can see this one being the most shilled alt coin. That's because most people will be coming from a stash of either Bitcoin or Ethereum, or both, before jumping on alts. And coming a little more from Ethereum, I can see them going for Matic. 2- XRP 50% sure All the negative things about centralization seem to have been forgotten. It's starting to look like XRP is portrayed as the hero coin fighting the SEC. 3- Doge 70% sure Don't expect that people will have learned anything about the big pump and dump, and the hype. And don't expect that they will turn to other meme coins instead. Doge is the established meme coin. 4- ATOM 65% sure This one is gonna be easy to shill for those shilling the tech side. There's too many positives and good numbers. And there's a reason why it's already showing signs of being the sub's darling for the next bull market. It has quickly moved up in the top mentioned coin on here. But watch out, it means it will also eventually tumble hard, if inverse r/cc still holds true. 5- ADA 55% sure The ""scientific"" blockchain will strike again with a new generation of crypto nerds. Every cycle Cardano gets ruled out, and every cycle it keeps coming back strong. And for some reason, the bull market has a boner for this coin. &#x200B; Other top coins: BNB, Polkadot, Link, Avax, Algo, Shib, FTM, AAVE, Vet, GRT, Uni. People are gonna eat those up again, despite some of them having some shortcomings. Also, each cycle the alt landscape changes less and less. So we're not gonna see that big of a dramatic change in popular coins. &#x200B; # Biggest surprises, that will do well: Alt coins that will surprisingly be strong: 1- SOL At this point, it doesn't seem like the market cares about a coin being down or being shut down. Just look at ETC who got 51% attacks multiple times, and keeps coming back in the top 50. A new batch of people will jump in and go ""but it's so fast"". So don't be surprised if SOL has a strong bull market, despite its shortcomings. 2- Casper Labs I think this will be one of those new hot coins full of powerful tech, like Harmony was in the last cycle. Hopefully without the bridge hack. 3- Moons Not to shill Moons, but objectively, bull markets helped boost Moons in the past from $0.009 to over $0.40, thanks to increased activity. And this time around, Moons will have mainnet, much more utility, and could draw more hype from outside Reddit. &#x200B; # Coins that will remain too underrated. 1- Monero Monero has gotta to be the most underrated crypto of all cycles. And I think this next bull market won't be that much diffferent. 2- LTC Despite a high market cap right now, I think it will be overtaken by several coins, and not receive that much hype. 3- XLM I think it will be overshadowed by XRP. Despite being one of the most useful for transactions. It won't get much hype. &#x200B; # The comeback kids. Coins that will make the biggest comeback. 1-Nano Just from already a few shill posts about Nano, I can already see some foreshadowing, a return of the annoying Nano shills, and this one making a big come back. There is already the same narrative ""why is a coin that's so fast and with no fees, not a top 10 coin?"". Don't bother explaining it, they will still buy it. 2- LRC Same thing. I think the shills and the hype never truly died, they just went into hibernation. 3- Harmony This is another bold prediction. A new generation will come in and just see the really impressive tech side, and impressive numbers for TPS, finality, low fees, and see the big potential in their smart contracts. And when we'll try to explain to them the bridge hack, they'll just go ""that's it?"". However, there will need to be some revival on the team side for that to happen. &#x200B; # Coins that might tumble and crumble. 1- Tron This is a risky prediction. People could eat up Tron, and it's managed to do well despite all its issues. But I'm gonna wager Tron will finally tumble like BSV. 2- SNX This one could potentially explode and do really well. But because of the regulatory climate right now, I would lean more on SNX facing some real danger from regulation. 3- \[Insert the next coin that will pull an FTT, CEL, LUNA, etc\] There's already several potential candidates, and I don't know which one to chose. But I'm willing to bet we'll see history repeat itself again, and many people who didn't learn their lesson. &#x200B; # How biased I am: Here are my holdings for full disclosure: My 3 main and large holdings are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Moons. My small bags, but still significant enough: ATOM, LINK, XMR, XLM. And then I hold a really small amount of over a dozen more alt coins.",1,0,2023-04-19 13:05:37,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('pepe apparently', 6), ('ctsi clearly missed doubled price since last week

Moonshot small-cap coin - price analysis based on Market Cap multiples,"Today, I encountered a very interesting post about PEPE coin - a new coin that emerged a few days ago. Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe\_mooning\_meme\_coins\_exceed\_caution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe_mooning_meme_coins_exceed_caution/) Many people caught it early and made a multiple of their money. In this post, I'll try to explain why you're most probably too late to do a 100000% return on it. # Let's do some maths The current market cap of PEPE is $100m as per: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/) How much of a multiple can we expect? Well, the largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $11b. I'll round it down to $10b. So: If PEPE overtakes DOGE, it will do ""just"" a 100x. If PEPE overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x. * If PEPE reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x. So, is it worth it to throw $100 right now? Maybe it's a bit late - it's highly unlikely that it will overtake DOGE, and even if it did, you'll have $10k - not nearly enough even for a lambo, not to even speak about retiring early. On the other hand, I think it's realistic for PEPE to reach $200m or $300m market cap, which will 2-3x your money. If you want to gamble, be my guest. But you're not retiring from this. Exercise caution and be careful. Once a coin is mentioned on this sub, it's already too late.

Have some casino money- what meme coins do you think I should throw it in for the coming bull cycle?,I know it's a taboo topic but I wanted to enjoy some meme coins if I can. Doge and shib seem so boring now. Any new meme coins you think it would be fun throwing in around 1000 dollars in? I have a healthy ETH/BTC and Atom portfolio already.

"I bought $1k of the Top 10 Cryptos on January 1st, 2023 (MARCH Update/Month 3/+40%)","&#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/oneyjs9ngvua1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb9e315e3d7504417873982e770737947641d20 Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3). Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 2nd monthly report for the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, and LTC. SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 APRIL Snapshot). tl;dr What's this all about? I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include stablecoins) [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/). Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/). MARCH Highlights: \- XRP outperforms the field in March by far, BTC takes overall lead from February and takes the overall lead from MATIC. The 2023 portfolio is +40% so far this year. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period. New feature: for the third straight month, AMKT outperforms my Top Ten in March and is +63% vs. the Top Ten's +40% in this year's friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). ## Month Three - Up +40% https://preview.redd.it/tittxtmugvua1.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=463ffe4a47a6020ba5f2a26bf837c20e5bcbe702 The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC. March highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: After an all-green [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), two straight mixed months for the 2023 Top Ten XRP (+34%) outperformed the field this month. BTC turned in the second best performance of March and is in the overall lead. All cryptos in positive territory for the year ## March Ranking and Dropouts Here's a look at the movement in the ranks three months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment: https://preview.redd.it/wz5bk10wgvua1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a10767e268a07718e88a4ec22a8dec32076edf Remarkably steady so far during the first 90 days of 2023 and no dropouts yet. ## March Winner and Loser March Winner - XRP rose +34% in March, significantly outperforming the other Top Ten cryptos. . March Loser - After a strong first couple months of 2023, MATIC lost some momentum, falling -11% this month. ## Overall Update: BTC overtakes MATIC for the lead, all crypto in the green. Every crypto in this year's Experiment is in positive territory. BTC overtook MATIC this month to take the top spot. This is the first time this year that Bitcoin has held the overall lead. The initial $100 invested in BTC ninety days ago is worth $171 today. ADA is next, +59% since New Year's Day. DOGE is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, but is still in the green at +12% for the year. ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023: https://preview.redd.it/ivvsf7aygvua1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0ee6a10cc473892567dacce33c88f85c4595ec The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio gained $60 in March. The initial $1000 investment on New Year's Day 2023 is now worth $1,402. Here's a visual summary of the progress so far: https://preview.redd.it/azghe2dzgvua1.png?width=252&format=png&auto=webp&s=c395058b629410f8da5f34d48f98a4485a548a9d ## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT). New feature this year - The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market. Much has changed in the last 5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market instead of manually buying coins and tokens ([like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)). This year's friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). AMKT is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index. Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market - exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start. Here's the question I'm tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund? On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT. Three months into the Experiment, here's the AMKT snapshot: https://preview.redd.it/d4jnmwr0hvua1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=892e9e3d9ca6ce44d08502d28eecd6f3b394dbf6 March Performances: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: +4% AMKT: +14% The March monthly victory goes to: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) Overall since January 1st, 2023: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: current value $1,402 (+40%) AMKT: current value $1,631 (+63%) Overall lead: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) For the more visual, here's the table I'll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. AMKT competition this year: https://preview.redd.it/93395m12hvua1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5ca9a30e3254f0b8e42c22c71335364f03e6aa ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios So, where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -35% (total value $646) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +228% (total value $3,284) [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +388% (total value $4,883) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +94% (total value $1,937) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $313) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +40% (total value $1,402) Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $12,465. That's up +108% on the combined portfolios. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021's all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%. Here's the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals: https://preview.redd.it/dyobuj43hvua1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7994a36685d5b8151495b74d0ceeb9c732ea0c In summary: That's a +108% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/35jo6s84hvua1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e36f6d6c66d03f6fdd248af42682d594e70574 The S&P 500 is up +7% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year's Day would be worth $1,070 had it been redirected to the S&P. Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I've been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,540 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,070 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,470. That is up +25% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +108% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: https://preview.redd.it/59v4ake5hvua1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0e47b0e2514497367e7f3051bc0394c3acb38a ## Conclusion: To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. A reporting note: I'll focus on 2023 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.

Most decentralized cryptos by number of full nodes,"We hear all the time about how some coin is more centralized than others, but the question is how centralized? A good way to measure this is the number of ""full nodes"" in the network. I compiled a list of the top 10 market cap coins by number of ""full nodes"" plus added a few I know to have a large network even if they have a smaller market cap. Full nodes are computers or servers with an entire copy of the blockchain that can participate in consensus. Node count is important for security, decentralization, and network resiliency.

Decoding Crypto Memes: A Tale of Two Coins,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the depths of the cryptocurrency meme culture, exploring the enigmatic world of two particular coins that have captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Hold onto your private keys, because this post is about to get wild! In the red corner, we have the reigning meme champ, Dogecoin ($DOGE). Spawned from the legendary Shiba Inu meme, Dogecoin initially started as a joke in 2013, but has since become a formidable force in the crypto world. With a thriving community and Elon Musk as its unofficial mascot, Dogecoin has reached heights that would leave its creators in awe. In the blue corner, we have a newcomer to the crypto-meme world, Garlicoin ($GRLC). Launched in 2018, Garlicoin was inspired by the garlic bread meme that took the internet by storm. Created as a parody, Garlicoin has since built a dedicated community of followers, all sharing a passion for cryptocurrency and a love for garlicky goodness. As these two meme-laden cryptocurrencies battle for supremacy, their respective communities have been engaging in friendly banter and creative content, both online and offline. From Dogecoin-inspired graffiti to Garlicoin's garlic bread giveaways, these two coins have brought joy and laughter to many in the world of cryptocurrency. Despite their memetic origins, both Dogecoin and Garlicoin have inspired real-world projects and charitable initiatives. Dogecoin has funded NASCAR sponsorships, Jamaican bobsled teams, and even water wells in Kenya. Meanwhile, Garlicoin's community has engaged in philanthropic efforts, such as disaster relief fundraising and combating food insecurity. As we witness the ongoing duel between these two meme coins, we can't help but appreciate the levity and humor they bring to the often-serious world of cryptocurrency.

Study reveals most popular crypto payment methods on Bitrefill,"# Study reveals most popular crypto payment methods on Bitrefill ### ETH is responsible for the highest financial usage values, while LTC, DOGE and DASH are used more than BTC's Lightning Network; according to researcher. Data Scientist and Market Research Consultant Matt Ahlborg published a [study](https://twitter.com/MattAhlborg/status/1647966698845208576) on Monday (17) on the popularity of payment methods used on the leading cryptocurrency commerce platform: Bitrefill. Bitrefill is an e-commerce site for digital products that uses crypto-only as a means of exchange for the purchase of: Gift Cards, Mobile Recharges, Gaming and Travelling. The company in question is a leader in the segment, with more than 400,000 customers worldwide. According to Matt Ahlborg - who describes himself as ""a Data Scientist with an obsession for emerging financial technologies and their corresponding impact on our world. Specifically, I study utility usage of cryptocurrency and other financial technology within informal markets of developing countries."" - His study aims to boost the cryptocurrency payments industry. https://preview.redd.it/4ihsr9pv24va1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=32ab7eb888d882a83e66b3afa558d2d01bc10650 In general, the scientist points out that, despite maintaining the leadership in number of users on Bitrefill, Bitcoin (BTC) has been losing ground to other crypto payment methods in the last four years. He explains that there are several nuances to the phenomenon and dives into each asset group to understand the meaning behind this data. In general, the scientist points out that, despite maintaining the leadership in number of users on Bitrefill, Bitcoin (BTC) has been losing ground to other crypto payment methods in the last four years. He explains that there are several nuances to the phenomenon and dives into each asset group to understand the meaning behind this data. # Ethereum is responsible for transactions with the highest financial value Payments in Ether (ETH) have the highest average value among all competitors. Which means that, on average, payments in ETH are responsible for the highest financial values of purchases on the Bitrefill platform. According to Matt, this can be explained by the high capitalization in the Ethereum ecosystem. Not just considering the market cap of ETH, but also the entire ecosystem with ICOs, IDOs, NFTs, DeFi, etc. - which end up returning value for the base token (ether) and then for its use on the platform. The researcher claims that this large functional ecosystem is further enhanced by the existence of stablecoins such as USDT and USDC in ERC-20 token - which creates a self-sustaining circular economy, which keeps capital within the network. Ether usage is prominent in the northern western hemisphere, with higher usage in North America and Europe. # Litecoin, Dogecoin and Dash are more used than Bitcoin's Lightning Network The scientist-consultant then draws a comparison with the Lightning Network, Bitcoin's second layer network, with other altcoins that he calls ""Legacy Coins"" - such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dash (DASH). https://preview.redd.it/k6rpy09334va1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=747856ddbbffcb7602bb447c75d77312ca9ee6aa Matt Ahlborg points to visible growth in payments via Lightning, but comments that it is probably lesser than expected by many enthusiasts in the Bitcoin community. In 2019, for example, co-founder of bitcoin wallet BlueWallet Igor Korsakov [claimed](https://twitter.com/fulmolightning/status/1139451260539568128) that ""The Lightning Network makes 99.85% of all Altcoins obsolete. I did the math myself."" However, in February of this year (2023) the wallet [announced the shutdown of its Lightning Network custodial service](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio/status/1628733798438281216). And four years later, the data found at Bitrefill seems to point in the opposite direction. The researcher responsible for the study points out as a possible explanation that the vast majority of payments in ""Legacy Coins"" are not carried out by self-custodial wallets, but directly from known addresses of exchanges. According to Matt, the lack of support for Lightning by exchanges can be a decisive factor in choosing payment methods with lower fees and confirmation time than BTC. Another evidence of this is the increase in these means of payment during times when bitcoin fees are higher or when transactions take longer to confirm. The scientist works with the hypothesis that Bitcoin investors who keep their coins on exchanges, make the swap to some of the ""legacy coins"" in order to save on fees and reduce the operating costs of their investments. However, he also points out that these coins benefit from a lot of liquidity and trading volume in the spot market, which makes them interesting means of payment tools - with DOGE and LTC ranked at number 4 and 5 in liquidity, ahead of other cryptocurrencies. https://preview.redd.it/bhqxnnla34va1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=db85e60ec1c2da30fbd47b8484275d87ba41f40e Finally, Ahlbourg cites payments in USDT on the Tron Network as one of the favourite choices of Bitrefill users, very close to payments made through Binance, using Binance Pay. In conclusion, the researcher shares the opinion that more centralized solutions should suffer attacks and lose space for more decentralized solutions.",5,20,2023-04-20

A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency - 2023 Version,"What is a blockchain? It is an ""immutable ledger."" Now before I go on, we should pause here and really think about what that means. An immutable ledger. And really today its more then a ""ledger,"" which implies its only use is financial, its more a ""record book."" A record book that can never be changed. Wow. Can you imagine if society had a record book that could never be changed? At least then we'd know the sphinx was originally a lioness for sure. But when you think about blockchain, think about it like a record book that lives in the sky. Every time there is a transaction, like Laszlo sent Jeremy 10,000 BTC, it's written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever manipulated, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry. In a deeper, non-technical sense, Blockchain, is also the reinvention of ""trust."" This ted talk from more then 5 years ago is still super illuminating for those first entering this space. (Tedtalk - Blockchain Massively simplified) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53LUZxUF50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53LUZxUF50) What is proof of Work? While most think that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, there was actually many attempts before Bitcoin. Dating all the way back to 1990. But regardless, they could all be considered ""first generation"" cryptocurrency. First generation cryptocurrency worked of the concept of Proof of work. Here, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward for running the expensive hardware, and using your own electricity, you get coin. ""Mining."" Mining, however, has it's draw backs. First, it's slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute. Second, it's wasteful. Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin has been notorious for the amount of energy used. When I first wrote this (2021), I sited an article that said Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina. Now its Norway. But it's not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many would ague, more secure because of it. [https://originstamp.com/blog/here-is-why-bitcoin-transactions-take-so-long/](https://originstamp.com/blog/here-is-why-bitcoin-transactions-take-so-long/) [https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/) [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952) [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) [https://etherplan.com/2019/10/07/why-proof-of-stake-is-less-secure-than-proof-of-work/9077/](https://etherplan.com/2019/10/07/why-proof-of-stake-is-less-secure-than-proof-of-work/9077/) What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer) ""Second Generation"" cryptocurrencies introduced the idea of smart contracts. Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist and cryptographer was the first to introduce Smart contracts - back in 1994. But it was really our favorite 19 year old (At the time he founded ETH) hero Vitalik Buterin that would popularize the concept with Ethereum. But what is it? First let us start with what most people say. ""Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code."" Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party ""trusted agent,"" like a bank. But when I think about smart contracts, and what they could be, its really ANY CODE, that you could think of, that would be written to the blockchain making it also immutable. Any traditional application you could think of, like a warehouse inventory app, or commercial trucking tracker, could be potentially written with code that can never be changed. Which isn't to say new versions of the smart contract can't be created with changes, but having the complete audibility, forever, is invaluable. To the developer, and the customer. In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can't be manipulated.. Ever.. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) What is proof of Stake? ""Third generation"" cryptocurrencies introduced the concept of Proof of Stake. The idea was first introduced with Peercoin back in 2012, but widely popularized by Cardano in 2017. POS aimed to solve the ""cryptocurrency trilemma,"" decentralization, security, and scalability. But specifically, they wanted to create faster transactions, and for the system to use less energy, all while maintaining a high level of security. It's important to note that not all POS systems achieve ""consensus"" in the same fashion. I'd say the one I know best is Ouroboros. A protocol, created by IOG (Formerly IOHK) and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians. They created a secure ""lottery"" consensus mechanism to ""elect"" the next ""slot leader"" to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. POS is so superior, at least in the view of Ethereum development team, that they too moved from POW to POS in 2022, after a multiyear effort. Again stating that ""it is more secure, less energy-intensive, and better for implementing new scaling solutions compared to the previous [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) architecture."" Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on. Each have their own way of doing things. Each system has different philosophy and implementation of POS features. Like, ""locking,"" and ""slashing."" So, it's important to understand the ones you choose to invest in. What you should remember is that for POW, POS, and others, are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no ""decentralized network of immutable ledgers.""

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. MCap = $ \ Supply That is, it. But very important. BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million. Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you'll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway) Currently there are 19,351,768 BTC out there at a cost of $28,241. That means, the market cap is $546,513,280,088 (547B) = $28,241 \ 19,351,768 Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 34,788,770,948 at the current cost of 40 cents. $13,915,508,379.2 (14B) = $.40 \ 34,788,770,948 Cardano would have over a 1 trillion dollar market cap if the price went to $29. $1,008,874,357,492 (1T) = $29 \ 34,788,770,948 To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names. Apple - 2.6T Amazon - 1T Tesla - 516B Visa - 493B Bank of America - 238B It's very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. At times coins are ""burned."" Try to take the time to learn how your investment will change over time, and what the implication of supply has on your price goals.

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds. Day traders, H.O.D.L.'ers, Whales, and weak hands. Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically. Then there are those that ""Hold On for Dear Life."" These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dip, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or ""Dollar cost average (DCA)"" by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only ""take profit"" buy selling a small portion when price is really high. Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often ""test"" the market by either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you're reading this, you're probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace. Then there are ""weak hands."" Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Each has its own risks and rewards. Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implications with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing. HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your ""Return on Investment (ROI)"" improves significantly in crypto. Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

A lot. First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering. Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever. Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this. But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them. When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack. Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. But it will not be like that forever. Chains will eventually be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges. Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn't much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now. But more important than the ""dream"" is that they can be hacked. They are a web 2.0 application. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way. This crypto-winter has been chalk full of these examples. Lastly, there is the notion of ""passive income"" and ""interest."" With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to ""stake"" their coin by earning interest. With POW systems, like bitcoin, you'd have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With coins like Cardano Ada you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, that only you can access, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins. And that last sentence is really the ""key."" You'll hear a lot ""not your keys not your crypto."" What that means is that the wallet address associated to you is secured by a cryptographic asymmetric key pair. The whole reason this technology is secure, is because it uses cryptographic certificates in order to authenticate and authorize the user. When you use an exchange they hold these keys. They can lose them, or they can shut down and hold them. When you setup your wallet, the private key is stored on your device.

NonFungible Tokens are ""metadata"" attached to an ""asset,"" that is written to the blockchain. The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset. The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs. It's a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file. But it's not stored in the blockchain like most assume. Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage. IPFS is very cool, but it's not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable."" So what's the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today. The big deal is twofold. First, you are not uploading anything to the ""internet."" That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, mutable, and gated. What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time. Or at least as long as the blockchain is still running. Let us sit and think about that for a second. De Beers is going to have to get a new slogan. ""A diamond NFT is forever"" Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents. It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb through chains. Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first. Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and never again dispute who owns the land after a conflict. Gaming is also another area where NFTs have potential. Its not fair that you can pay for things in game, but that you don't own them. That you can't transfer them. I should be able to buy a skin, and a dope sword, play with it for a while, then later put it up for auction. Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world. That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs. Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today. The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain. What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if it's not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there. The second problem is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first. Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs. Fortunately, there are people looking to solve these problems.

Crypto phases I wish had skipped...,"We've all had our low points, and crypto is no exception. I'd like to share some of the different phases I went through in crypto, all of which I wish I never went through. Hopefully this will save some of you from wasting your time and money like I did... &#x200B; Trading on the Crypto dot com app As most of you know, the CDC app has high fees, and high spreads. If you must, use their exchange (unless you are in the US) The app has a nice UI that works (kinda) well, and is best suited for brand new investors. Frequent buys and sells in app will result in losses that would have been easily preventable. Full-porting into dog tokens If you say you've never bought Doge or SHIB, you're a liar. I for one have bought them, and at one time had most of my portfolio sunk into them. We all already know how this turned out. Meme tokens are fun, and if you want to hold them, do so sparingly. Not understanding Market Cap This one goes along with the bullet above. The appeal to most shitcoins is the extremely low price, which tricks new investors thinking they have gotten in at ""such a low price!"" I bought a few million SHIB a few years back thinking it could reach the price of Bitcoin, oh how wrong I was. Neglecting blue chips (BTC and ETH) Pretty self explanatory. Sure, alts may make you more money, or may not... Too frequently sending your money off the exchange This one is for my broke boys out there. When I started investing in crypto, I never had much, and gas fees were noticeable to my holdings. I'd send my crypto off each time I bought, dwindling my holdings little by little. I will never preach keeping your money on the exchanges, but you also don't need to send it off each time you buy. So unless you buy thousands at a time, maybe consider keeping your money on the exchange for a couple weeks, and send 7-21 days worth of buys to save on gas. It sure would have saved me some money. Keeping your money on the exchange I am well aware this appears to contradict the above point, but what I meant by this one is having the exchange hold your money forever. When you buy on the exchange, the money is never really yours. You are essentially given a carnival ticket that says the exchange owes you the money whenever you'd like to withdraw. The money is never yours until it is back in your bank account (up for debate after SVB), or withdrawn to your personal crypto wallet. I have never personally been effected by and exchange collapse, and I don't plan to. This is the only way to ensure you have control over your crypto. Having high expectations for returns Expecting insane returns on your investments will leave you waiting for a day that may never come. You won't ever take profits, and will be left holding the bag. I'm looking at you CRO. Setting realistic expectations will help you take profits when the time comes. * Staring at the charts all day I can almost guarantee nothing will happen if you step away for a few hours, or even days. Rest those eyes, get some sleep. Everything will be okay. &#x200B; There you have it. I am in no way a Crypto vet, but man I have done some dumb shit.

How do you spot the next big coin (and buy in early enough)?,"I know it's not a reliable ""get rich quick"" scheme, but people have actually gotten rich pretty quickly on coins that were never even meant to be taken serious like DogeCoin. Solana is currently worth $22.62/SOL, was $0.51 May 10, 2020, but shot up to a mindblowing $260.00 on November 5, 2021. SAND wasn't even $0.01 yet at the end of 2020, but reached $7.43 November 24, 2021. Some people have made thousands, if not millions (yes, probably much more rare) from just a few dollars initially invested. I know you can't predict this stuff, but I think it's still a better bet than buying lottery tickets, because at least you can HODL indefinitely, meaning there's always chance for it to skyrocket later, unlike a lottery ticket which expires after that draw. I have so far only purchased on CoinBase, and they do not allow the sale of many brand new coins that still have tons of .0s to fall off. I already have crypto I plan to HODL for the longterm. But those numbers barely change on a daily basis. Even Bitcoin started in the fractions of a penny, reaching $0.08 at the end of the first month. People said it was stupid, a scam, but it's now over $23,000, and was at a high of $64,899 on April 13, 2021. Obviously it's much more exciting to get rich in a matter of a few months, rather than years, or even worse, decades, but I already have crypto specifically dedicated for long-term HODL'ng (1,000+ ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, 2,500 HBAR, over 10 million SHIBA [which of course is only worth a little over $100] and even 1,000 DOGE). Being passive is boring though, your life will fly by if all you do is wait. I'm not trying to sink thousands, or probably not even hundreds of dollars into crypto not yet on centralized exchanges. I'm aware that it's more like gambling, and not a reliable way to ""get rich quick"". I'm just asking how to find these coins and determine how likely they are to ""shoot to the moon"", and where and how to actually purchase and hold them, because they're unavailable on CoinBase. I couldn't even buy Bitgert (BRISE) on Binance, or Bitmart. They aren't allowed to sell it in my state, because big brother won't allow you to risk your own money in certain things (but it's perfectly fine in other risky investments). You can't tell me ALL these ""big winners"" are PURELY blind luck...... And even if so, how and where can I actually purchase them? I only know how to buy crypto on CoinBase, and they don't allow a lot outside of well established coins.....",1,1,2023-04-21 06:45:07,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('hello cryptdoh looks like might found new scam please report scam crossposting rcryptoscams rcryptoscamreport visiting scamalertio tips avoid scams click bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subredditmessagecomposetorcryptocurrency questions concerns', 1), ('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1), ('need get lucky different gambling', 1)]",spot next big coin buy early enough know reliable get rich quick scheme people actually gotten rich pretty quickly coins never even meant taken serious like dogecoin solana currently worth sol may shot mindblowing november sand wasnt even yet end reached november people made thousands millions yes probably much rare dollars initially invested know cant predict stuff think still better bet buying lottery tickets least hodl indefinitely meaning theres always chance skyrocket later unlike lottery ticket expires draw far purchased coinbase allow sale many brand new coins still tons fall already crypto plan hodl longterm numbers barely change daily basis even bitcoin started fractions penny reaching end first month people said stupid scam high april obviously much exciting get rich matter months rather years even worse decades already crypto specifically dedicated longterm hodlng ada algo matic xlm hbar million shiba course worth little even doge passive boring though life fly wait im trying sink thousands probably even hundreds dollars crypto yet centralized exchanges im aware like gambling reliable way get rich quick im asking find coins determine likely shoot moon actually purchase hold theyre unavailable coinbase couldnt even buy bitgert brise binance bitmart arent allowed sell state big brother wont allow risk money certain things perfectly fine risky investments cant tell big winners purely blind luck even actually purchase know buy crypto coinbase dont allow lot outside well established coins
"After these past couple of days of meme coins rocketing off and people bashing them (for mostly correct reasons) I think we should have another look at the king of meme coins, Dogecoin","After these past couple of days of meme coins rocketing off and people bashing on them (for mostly correct reasons) I think we should have another look at the king of meme coins, Dogecoin. As I believe there is a lot of misunderstanding behind Dogecoin. Problem 1) First and foremost is its inflation. How bad is Doge's 'infinite' inflation? Dogecoin is mined at a rate of 10,000 DOGE per minute, which results in 14,400,000 DOGE created per day. Yearly, 5,256,000,000 Coins are added to the supply. Though this looks like a massive number, how does it compare to Doge's current Circulating Supply? Doge right now rounded down has a circulating supply of just over 139 Billion DOGE. If we were to add these newly minted coins then (making the circulating supply 144,275,086,383), 3.58% DOGE is added to the supply in a year's time. Because there will always be 10,000 DOGE added per minute, the % rate of new Doge created will continuously go down. So how about the years that follow? 2023-2024 - 3.58% 2024-2025 - 3.45% 2025-2026 - 3.34% 2026-2027 - 3.23% 2027-2028 - 3.13% 2028-2029 - 3.03% In 6 years, we will see Doge slowly drop to around 3% inflation, and will continue to lower as long as it uses this system. To this end it seems that DOGE's only use-case argument is as a store of value to be used for transactions. In other words, it wants to compete with fiat currencies to be used in stores (not as an investment). Also of note, the inflation for Doge serves a few key purposes; It allows for lower fees (mentioned above), it encourages spending, it replaces DOGE locked/lost over time, and it helps to keep the price low over time. Inflationary assets encourage spending/using as opposed to deflationary assets which encourage hoarding (why sell BTC for 35k today when you could sell it for 100k later?). If Doge was widely accepted as a currency, there would be a higher demand and with that a higher price. The inflationary nature of DOGE replaces coins in existence that are no longer accessible and helps to keep the price of DOGE from skyrocketing to a price that it becomes difficult to understand/spend in relation to an underlying FIAT value (BTC currently has this problem and is trying to convert people into thinking of BTC in terms of Sats). What is Doge daily Rate of Inflation (RoI) and how does it compare to a few other top coins? Doge RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about .0109% inflation every day. (3.58% a year) DOT RoI varies but currently is roughly between .016 -.027% (6-10% a year) BTC RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about 1.96% a year Litecoin RoI decreases over time but currently stands at about 3.66% a year Some perspective: the annual inflation rate of the U.S. dollar in 2023 stands at around 6.4% (this can change drastically if they turn the money printer on or off) Problem 2) It has no use case/it's just another meme/shitcoin. For anyone looking to invest in Dogecoin the long term use case of Doge is most likely as stated above a global way to transact (I.E. Buy, sell, tip). Yes Doge might get some additional use cases but the long term goal of DOGE is a global transacting cryptocurrency. Doge has low fees, you can send/spend/use doge for pennies The reason that Doge can have such low fees is that the network is secured through new coin issuance (inflation) paid to the miners - NOT end user fees. Worth Considering: The richest person in the world supports the long-term adoption of DOGE as a global currency. Problem 3) Doge is highly centralized to a handful of wallets and thus is a rugpull waiting to happen. The top 16 wallets own 44.9% of the supply. 5 of the current top 16 wallets owning roughly 30% of Doge are suspected to be RobinHood through various Cold/Hot storage wallets that are linked together. It is inherently difficult to prove who is the owner of a wallet without the owner coming forward, on most coins (including Doge) it's often expected the top wallets are usually exchanges. Additionally the current number 5 wallet is a burn wallet and owns 1.41% of Doge. If we count the top 16 unknown wallets, they own roughly 17.54% of the Doge (which again likely includes other exchanges) in existence. A far cry from the 44.9% that gets thrown around. &#x200B; Thanks for reading through this post, however you should know that I'm just the messenger and all of this was mostly taken from previous posts on reddit.

Thank you reddit users r/Gabester and r/Justdowninthemines for your work. You guys (gals) deserve all the upvotes! Lastly, I just wanted to state the obvious, that this post is by no means an endorsement for Dogecoin. I think it's probably the best of the meme coins, however my main beef with it is that it is manipulated by the king of pump and dumps, Elon Musk. I can't stand that Musk uses Doge as his plaything and therefore have little trust in Doge because of Musk's backing.",5,68,2023-04-21 14:00:00,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('dam degen moons win 🤣',

Let's talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/) So let's talk about Doge V Shiba Inu Utility Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. On-Chain Data Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. Doge's active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba's price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('ping verified users associated payments uatlosio bot

How a subreddit might have actually made at least one millionaire,"So, I am not sure how many of you here are actually aware of the /r/millionairemakers subreddit and how it works. But basically, the idea behind the subreddit is that if there is a single winner and everybody else in the subreddit sends them a single dollar this money can pile up real quick and change somebody's life. Sounds too good to be true right? And by having a quick glance at the [table](https://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/wiki/index/past_winners) of past winners you would probably find what you would expect, in some cases still a pretty nice sum of money, but nowhere near the million from the subreddit name... Well, there is a catch. A lot of these winners accepted donations in various cryptocurrencies, most notably BTC, LTC, and DOGE... but that was 8 years ago. Now you might see where this is going. I do not want to dox anyone who didn't already take security precautions so I will only make a single example (with a now cleared reddit account of all post history) - u/grendelwasamommasboy who, in a [now-deleted winner thread](https://www.unddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/2q9ung/santa_is_real_thank_you_all_so_much_i_am_still_in/) received more than $11K by various means. But the crazy thing is, this madman actually held their coins for close to 7 years and almost perfectly timed the top of the last bullrun cashing out multiple bitcoins AND one and a half million doge coins. This might as well be the first official millionaire made by /r/millionairemakers.",257,375,2023-04-22 20:16:37,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('interesting concept im willing bet cc made many

Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections. I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated. I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space. I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away. Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

As crypto continues to become more and more common as a tool for investment - what do you think the makeup of a crypto index fund modeled after S&P Index Funds would look like?,"When you take a look at many of the common low fee index funds that are based on the S&P and have particular leans, you'll see that companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google and NVDA are common names to be found and make up significant chunk of many of the most popular index funds in the stock market. Obviously Bitcoin and ETH would be 2 of the heavy hitters that would make up large chunks of a potential crypto based index fund. I'd exclude any tether or USD coin from the top 10 which would give you BNB, XRP, Cardano, Doge, Polygon (Matic), Solana, Polkadot, and Litecoin. Seems like some ideas for ETFs have included Bitcoin miners but those seem to be hit or miss in bull/bear markets. Are we going to get to a point where 99% of the alt coins go to near zero while the money flows into the largest coins (similar to what we're seeing with cash flowing out of small/regional banks and into the big 3 or 4)? Having a formalized index fund through Fidelity or Vanguard that allows direct exposure to crypto coins would legitimize the investment for people who may still be sidelined from wanting to expose themselves to such a seemingly volatile sector. I know I'd love it personally just to be able to divert some of my 401k into a crypto vehicle for the long haul. What are other means of exposure to crypto outside of spot buying coins that could be packaged into an crypto based index fund or ETF?",3,32,2023-04-23 22:54:34,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('sorry sub

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future. I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm. These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget. Is any of this project worth investing cos I guess Shiba Inu and Doge seem to start in this similar fashion some of didn't take it seriously",2,72,2023-04-23

What is Market Cap? And How To Use it For Analysis (Explained For n00bs),"In summary, market cap is the product of the price and the circulating supply of a coin. In other words, it's a measure that shows how large a project is. It's not a specific term for crypto and it's commonly used in traditional markets as well, such as stocks. Let's use a hypothetical company X for example: The price per share is $5 There are 1,000,000 shares outstanding The market cap is the price \ the shares = $5M # Finding the Market Caps for Coins The best places to find the market capitalizations (market caps in short) for crypto projects are: 1. CoinMarketCap 2. CoinGecko Just type in your project of choice and take a look. Here's an example for Bitcoin: https://preview.redd.it/yp7g2vl3m1wa1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef05af954c30b4b2acea8a039a4ad343dbabf40 As you can see above the chart, there are the relevant fields: The market cap - how big is the project currently, expressed in USD The ""fully diluted"" market cap - how big would the project be if all units are in circulation (remember, there is still Bitcoin that will be mined, so we don't count those in the market cap) Volume - how much BTC was traded in the last 24h, expressed in USD Circulating supply - how many BTC are in circulation at this particular moment. As you can see, currently we have 19,355,918BTC out of the 21M that will ever exist. The market cap is the reason why Bitcoin is #1 largest project. Not the price. You can find the same information for stocks on Yahoo Finance. # A Common Misconception (You Probably Have) A common bad habit many people have is looking only at the price. I'm referring to thinking that a coin can 1000x because its price is under $1. This is incorrect. To see the potential of a coin, you have to look at the price, but also at the market cap and the circulating supply. Many already understand why, but I'll give an example. # Analysis of a Hypothetical Coin: X INU Let's say there's a new meme coin called X INU. Its current price is $0.001. Before going all in thinking ""If it hits just $1, I'll make a 1000x!!1"", check whether it's possible for it to do such a multiple. You take a look at the market cap, and you see that it's $100M (i.e. there are 100,000,000,000 tokens in circulation). Now, what's the possibility of X INU doing a 1000x? Well, that would mean that the market cap would become $100B. Is it realistic to expect that the market will value a meme coin at 100 billion dollars? Let's check what the market says: # Comparing to Market Caps of Similar Projects We know that X INU has a market cap of $100M. The largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $10B, rounded down. So: If X INU overtakes DOGE, it will do a 100x. If X INU overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x. * If X INU reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x. So, in the highly unlikely scenario that this new meme coin jumps to one of the top positions per market cap, it will be just a 100x. And I'm saying ""just"" because the n00bs' dreams of retiring after throwing their life savings of $17 in a meme coin disappear after reading this. Basically, if you see that a coin already has a $100M market cap, you might expect a 2-3x if the conditions are great, but you're not even getting a lambo nor retiring early with such a project. # TLDR A $100M market cap meme coin won't do a 1000x. If it were to, we would see it right next to DOGE, among these titans:

Memecoins and you,So memecoins/ Shitcoins are the talk of the town at the moment due to PEPE and less so to Floki. But what is your personal relationship with them. Do you invest/hold them if and if so why. If you don't what are your reasons. Me personally I own a small bag of Shiba and Doge this is my don't eat a burger meal money thrown into here.

Floki Inu's Listing Skyrockets Price,"After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048. The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday. The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm. Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings. FLOKI's listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US' large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project's next goal. After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project's team and backers. The coin's market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('listing', 1), ('usual listing big exchanges results pumps thats see', 1), ('always say im going invest meme coins stuff like happens', 1), ('whos gon na jump provide liquidity insiders selling launch scam happens daily kucoin alone people still fall', 0), ('heres shill shit coin know exit liquidity people bought listing exchange right', 1), ('jump provide liquidity insiders unloading launch', 3), ('rugpull loading', 7), ('stop giving shit coins attention', 2), ('stop giving insiders liquidity', 2), ('stuff like happens daily exchanges like kucoin pump dump works buy spike watch slowly correct back insiders sell liquidity provide', 1), ('tale old crypto shitcoin community dreams binance listing shitcoin actually listed binance shitcoin hodlers think rally binance listing shitcoin dumps pretty much immediately following binance listing floki hasnt dumped yet coming guaranfuckingteed', 2), ('may go tomorrow even whale sell shitcoins moved whale makes centralized entities cases whales dump insiders', 1), ('way need chasing meme coins btc', 1), ('really giving attention memecoins thats gambling investment', 2), ('lot wowwww imagine', 1), ('short', 1), ('quick like lightening', 1), ('well said fuck shitcoins', 1), ('moron nope dont care', 1), ('hahaha 😝', 2), ('already dumpingits right', 1), ('pepe doge floki hot topic nowadays dont know people want lose money', 2), ('real pump hasnt happened yet', 1), ('hope shitcoins listed moons listed one day', 1), ('rugpullexe found', 3), ('day happiest person moon', 1), ('rocketing cant see zeroes dude', 1), ('aaaaaaaand', 1), ('op said retraced looool', 1), ('mention dogelon mars thats real sleeper', 2), ('stop giving nice chomp guys', 0), ('error project integrity found', 3), ('binance listing make doge killer', 1), ('remember rockets tend explode thats good outcome board', 2), ('error content', 3), ('sell news', 1), ('like floki dropped nice nft worth eth holding thought rugged waiting entry pump earlier year', 0), ('lets see next week', 1), ('another great day casino', 1), ('👏', 2), ('posts allowed yet educational posts coins seen shilling get removed', 0), ('discussion people think', 2), ('looked coinmarketcap trading price range past days yeah skyrocketing lmao', 1), ('tokens projects list pick', 1), ('stand delisting', 1), ('chompo gang', 2)]",floki inus listing skyrockets price euphoria subsided price retraced press time according coinmarketcap coin reached intraday high floki team argued launch binanceus deposits endorsed project consummated meme coin trilogy consisting doge shib binanceus listed floki announced usd usdt spot trading pairs coin tuesday move likely result bad blood tamadoge tama community whose token fell announcement bybit would list token rather binance us arm listings boost credibility even wellknown coins floki inu joins dogecoin shiba inu dogthemed coins trusted exchanges tamadoge pepe babydoge yet secure credible listings flokis listing binanceus american branch binance significant binanceus large trading volumes floki gain visibility importantly credibility given difficulty getting binance binanceus listing securing coinbase binance listings seem projects next goal listing announcement token entered top cryptocurrencies market cap ascent marked significant achievement projects team backers coins market cap since fallen

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 6 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV, and Tezos. tl;dr: What's this all about? I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and again in 2023. Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question) [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/). XRP wins March, followed by BTC. BNB in overall lead (by far) followed distantly by Ethereum. 2020 Top Ten is best performing of the six Experiments (+388%) 2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +108% vs. 25% if invested same amount and frequency with S&P500 ## Month Thirty-Nine - UP 388% https://preview.redd.it/zf1raxcjg2wa1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=786a79be9c32be491ff426027c560d7f4a21efb4 The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV, and Tezos. March highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: XRP wins March, followed by BTC. BNB is in the overall lead, by far, followed by ETH. The 2020 Portfolio is the best performing of the six Top Ten portfolios, up +388%. This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the +388% return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index. Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into Binance Coin and/or Ethereum would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style. ## March Ranking and Dropout Report https://preview.redd.it/q42kl9ykg2wa1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=97c13df7bbd8979ee2e74eff902dc3bcdaa09d8f Top Ten dropouts since January 2020: after thirty-nine months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out: EOS, BSV, Tezos, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash have been replaced by Cardano, DOGE, MATIC, SOL, and USDC. At #66, BSV has sunk the lowest since January 2020. ## March Winners and Losers March Winners - XRP easily outperformed the field, up +34% this month. Second place was BTC, +19%. March Losers - The forks had a bad month: both BSV (-14%) and BCH (-7%) underperformed their Top Ten peers this month. ## Overall Update - BNB in first place, nearly doubling the ROI of second place ETH. Majority of cryptos are in positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is best performing Portfolio. At +388%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the six [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 60% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, BSV, BCH, Tezos, and EOS the exceptions. Binance Coin continues to hold a dominating lead, followed distantly by ETH. The initial $100 investment thirty-nine months ago into first place Binance Coin? Currently worth $2,253, an increase of +2,152%. In second place is Ethereum, up +1,311%. BSV is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -64% since January 2020. ## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector: https://preview.redd.it/lbsg64img2wa1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=49e6929c0e2c0e15c063acc2a72bfb36944cf1e6 As a sector, crypto is up +523% over the thirty-nine month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment. If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+523%), you'd be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment's Top Ten approach (+388%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+27%) over the same time period.

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [70.4% in December 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/). ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020: https://preview.redd.it/hzxu934pg2wa1.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=48a0477ec71b26c95a35b49d5dbfbd72dd1047bd The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth $4,883 (+388%) from the initial $1k investment. The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the six Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along: https://preview.redd.it/mx997u9qg2wa1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=d78c3baa4db4aeb65c2c704fe3afb5a472055f2f ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios So what about combining six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -35% (total value $646) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +228% (total value $3,284) [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +388% (total value $4,883) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +94% (total value $1,937) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $313) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +40% (total value $1,402) So overall? Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After six annual $1k investments ($6,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth$12,465. That's up +108% on the combined portfolios, down from a +533% [November 2021 all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23) for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments. Lost in the numbers? Here's a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios: https://preview.redd.it/sfgp0n8tg2wa1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a982fa62adcb3c3f7c816252e8c49836bad7479 In summary: That's a +108% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/ngyu8bnug2wa1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b927a7431a43e49c6b77e27494c0b9799b091d0d Since the S&P 500 has returned +27% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,270 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning +388%, worth $4,883. That's a difference of $3,613 on a $1k investment. But that's just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world's slowest dollar cost averaging method? Here are the figures: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,540 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,070 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,470. That is up +25% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +108% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. To help provide perspective, here's a look at the combined five year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point. https://preview.redd.it/8fksj4cwg2wa1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ffe4a0e4b9e5b67d9b3c5cc92cdf3d05caf33ad ## Conclusion: For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, think long term, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

Will Doge really go to the moon?,"Since we all know that dogecoin is getting backed by Elon Musk and people also want him to accept payment in dogecoin for his Tesla cars. And since his single tweet can give a boost to the price of dogecoin, what do you think? Does Elon really take doge to the moon?

Do you think the future of Doge is tied to what happens with Elon?,"This topic is an idea I thought might be fun to discuss regardless of if you think Doge is the best thing since sliced bread or the worst thing to happen to crypto. Doge has had a strange trajectory and while it has down slid from the top 5 cryptos, it is still in the top 10 as of this post anyway. I started to theorize that Elons messy dealings like he's been having with Twitter may have some tie to Doges relatively dwindled popularity. So that's made me wonder if say for example Twitter went bankrupt, does that effect Doge or does the crypto/meme community not care. To be clear this thread isn't praising anyone or any crypto just kind of a market speculation curiosity, considering doge still ranks up there.

Portfolio input,"Looking for some honest feedback and/or criticism on my portfolio. No pissing match here, just want to make sure I'm setup for success over the next 2 years. I don't have false hopes of being a multimillionaire overnight, but I want to capitalize the next bullrun as much as possible. Nobody knows me here so I don't care about sharing rough figures. Right now I have roughly 55k invested. Also full disclosure, my figures below won't represent what I currently have locked in Celsius due to chapter 11. Not sure how much of that I'll get back, but hopefully a decent amount once that nightmare wraps up. Out of the coins I have full access to at the moment this is the rough breakdown: BTC: 62% DOT: 12% LINK: 8% VET: 4% AUDIO: 3% NEAR, HBAR, SAND, DAI: each ~2% DOGE, SHIB, FIL: each ~1% Locked on Celsius I have another .25 btc, about 8 ETH, and a good amount of stables I intended to buy the bottom of the market with (thanks a lot Mashinsky). Obviously if I added that to my available portfolio, the percentages of everything will be adjusted. As of right now, I'm considering it a loss until we are out of ch.11. Every month from now until the halving I plan to add an extra 1-2k to continue to DCA. Once the halving hits I'll likely sit on my hands for a year. With that additional money I plan to purchase new coins as well as strengthen my positions in some of the lower cap coins on my list. Coins I plan to add are: THETA, XRP, ADA, FET, MATIC, SOL, QNT, BAND. I'd like to knock my btc exposure down to 40-50% by time I'm done. I know my portfolio is not loaded with coins that have 50 X potential. I'm looking for growth, but I'm also looking for safety. I don't really want shit coins that have tremendous risk (I understand risk is relative in this sector). I don't mind throwing a grand or two in something as a YOLO play, but I want majority of my pics to be blue chip, or at least in the top 25 or so coins. Im a big fan of passive income so I love stakable coins. That's essentially the reason DOT is currently my #2 holding. I'm not going to fall for your scams, so don't bother messaging me. I won't reply to private messages.

My crypto investments is my healthiest investment that I've ever made!,"Here's my personal story about crypto: Before I knew about crypto (or investing at all!) I used to spend the few money I had left for smoking. I did not see any financial difference if I would kept the fiat (which inflates in such high rates in my country) saved or if I would buy cigarettes and literally put all these money into smoke. Then I've heard about DOGE back in 2021, I wanted to get some profits, too. But I didn't have money to invest, so I've thought. The only money I could afford to lose was my smoking money. So I've stopped smoking (believe me, the first months were hard to withstand) to invest in crypto. It's would be an own story to tell you how my crypto investments went (spoiler: I am in a total loss, monetary wise), but my belief that crypto will one day enter a bullmarket again kept me going on. While I cannot say that I've made profits with crypto in terms of ""money gains"", but I made health gains!!! Investing in crypto means for me, investing in myself, in my health and in my financial future.

Why Moons will never be Top100,"So basically I've seen a lot bullish but quite delusional opinions regarding Moons, as a currency and its potential outcome. Here is my totally bearish opinion on Moons. # Why am I posting this ? A lot of people are talking about seeing Moons in the Top 100, 50 even higher sometimes. So let's get it straight, I do not believe this will ever happen. You'll hear that some shitcoins went parabolic in a few days with less holders and this could send Moons to $100 if it simply matched Doge's Market Cap or something. This is utter madness and not only delusional but showing a true lack of education about the whole ecosystem (In my opinion) # Quick reminder on Moons To make it clear, I must remind you that technically Moons are not supposed to be traded. Also, according to Reddit ToS, Moons are meant to be solely a Governance Token without monetary value. While I totally understand this is a legal stand to prevent any juridic inconvenience, people need to understand that by no means Reddit will support trading, listings or anything related to the fact people can take this governance token out of his way. This is a free market, people are able to trade it and price reflects simply the offer / demand for it. I still don't understand why anyone would want to buy Moons, but I'll get back to it later. # Not your everyday shitcoin Now let me explain why I can't see a lucrative future for Moons holders. First, while it is a shitcoin, Moons can't be compared to others with aggressive marketing campaigns like Shiba did with Vitalik, or Doge being directly pumped by Musk. You can find every example in the world, Moons have no reason to get pumped simply because they are not meant for it. You may then ask why shitcoins like BabyMuskCumBucket on the BSC will pump eventually : because this is their only purpose and people play the greater fool game trying to get in early and get out on time. # No one cares Another interesting stat : there are 6+ million people in this sub, interested in cryptos and for sure knowing about Moons, but we are not even 200K holders. This means barely 3% of the ""biggest crypto community"" care about Moons that are free. So now tell me how someone out of this sub would care more, having to buy them. # Holder repartition is a Red Flag My last point is that even if Moons were to magically pump one day, considering the distribution of wallets, there are already too much Moon whales to maintain a healthy bullrun. As soon as it would break ATH or say reach the scandalous value of $1, most whales will dump their bags and empty out liquidities everywhere. Most liquidity providers would face IL and I bet even arbitrage bots, if there's any focusing on Moons, wouldn't help. On a side note, KM is only creating artificial scarcity, thus making price moves after snapshot and distribution. It is not needed for the governance use of the token and actually penalize liquidity providers. It has been voted by whales to secure their bag and make sure most people are incentivized to hold while they can dump at anytime. # Usecase > Pump Moons value is bound to the fact it is inflationary and airdropped every month. What would be the intencive for buyers ? Why would they throw cash at it if most of the supply is owned by people who had it for free ? As a final word, I think a pump on Moons value would do more harm than good, and it needs to keep a stable value to best serve it's very purpose : governance. * I would love to hear your opinion on

Poor folks getting rich in crypto? Myth vs. reality possibility vs. probability?,"We've all heard the Otis Spunkmire story about those delicious cookies that took Otis from homelessness and poverty to a wealthy household name and the story of the American dream. The tales of sudden Bitcoin millionaires and lost treasures in long forgotten wallets flood the crypto ethos like urban legends and bring new blood, and new funds to the space daily. Like miners panning for gold people from all walks of life flood the crypto space and provide fuel for market and make great targets for the well equipped scammer and the next rug pull. Like walking into a casino after having read one book on how to play poker, then getting eyes drawn to the new high tech slot machines individuals are quickly reminded of P.T. Barnum's quote, ""there's a sucker born every minute,"" as they attempt to explain to their families where the Christmas bonus went. Dejected and dismayed they vow unwittingly to get the money back and then some. After all they've heard Pepe is the new Doge and the old Doge is about to do it again. All they need to do is swap they current bags and Hodl and in time they'll moon, right? Or at least that's what the latest YouTube guru says as they point out ""life changing gains."" Is it real? I'm of the belief that 90% or more of the recognized ""outliers"" have had way more going for them besides a dollar and a dream. Things like exposure to market, ability to read charts, above average financial literacy and a decent financial cushion certainly have allot to do with so called ""overnight successes."" Rags to riches stories are enticing however. How many have hodled while they watched their dream come true then crash into oblivion? Sucked in by community hype and under the illusion that the superior tech was going to take their coin to the next level those who don't know what volatility really means are destined to find out. There's a learning curve to anything worthwhile. Education is rarely free. It demands to be paid for one way or the other. Exchange fees, transfer fees, gas fees, transaction, fees, and taxes take the poor man for a ride, and by the time all is said, and done how much better off were they? I suppose it's more of a question than a statement. Because I'd love to hear about the natural fortunate, genuine, lucky, crypto millionaire.

We aren't doing enough to help promote moons as a community(and how we can change that),"Now we all know how much hype is important for the growth of a crypto project, and yet all we do here is shill them to ourselves, creating a big echo chamber while making it unlikely for the entire internet to hear about our token. I think one of the strongest points about our token is the size of the community, but unlike other shitcoin communities, we don't really spread the word about ours anywhere we go. For example, I have seen some of my irl friends have doge as their profile pic on facebook, I've personally worked as a writer for a community shiba inu website where they try to promote shib for the internet, and so on and so forth.. Also, I saw many people on reddit recruiting meme posters on 4chan about crypto projects, and some even recruit ""guerilla marketers"" , who try and push certain coins without making it obvious in crypto subs like this one. The thing is , we can do all this to help push our token and grow its adoption. Try to mention moons on crypto twitter like all shitcoin degens do. If you're a 4chan user let them know about your x10 play (moons). It isn't really unethical because I'm pretty sure moons are more of a solid investment han the DogeElonCum kind of tokens shilled around there. That way we can have a domino effect and have the media covering us ,more people buying our token, and eventually more cex listings and positive price action.

"I want some sound, logical, reasonable, technical, and factually backed Bitcoin fud - where should I look?","It's hard to find it here cuz most have made up their minds for/against Bitcoin already, and the majority of posts lately are Marco reposts or comedy flairs for the moon farmer's market stand. The Bitcoin sub is too bullishly cracked on memes and the Buttcoin sub is an echo chamber of ragers who missed the bottom. I don't want philosophical or moral or conceptual or dollar to zero stuff. I want to know the technical limitations Bitcoin currently has in achieving what all the bulls say it will someday achieve. Some examples of what I want to dive more into: Bear : tps too low Bull: lightning network Bear: opening/maintaining channels is weird/difficult because of xyz Bear: halvings eventually won't reward miners Bull: fees will generate mining revenue Bear: exorbitant fees on a deflationary asset will further discourage transactions volume and monetary velocity meaning less revenue to secure the pow network and perhaps less economic gdp. Bear: privacy? Bull: mixers and utxo w/ diff addresses Bear: govs eventually sanctioning protocols potentially used for tax evasion or money laundering which may lead to cutting off fiat on-ramps for wallet addresses that have interacted with such protocols. It's my understanding that Bitcoin set out to replace fiat currency and become the ultimate store of value. If it can't outdo the current tps for the modern digital economy, can't maintain a stable store of value with its speculative volatility, and may or may not have its security compromised with the lack of capitalist incentives in a non decentralized mining environment down the road (like 1-4 major miners cherry picking what makes it into each block), how will it ever achieve anything more than it already has? Will it forever be an open infrastructure with a hodl strategy peddled by speculative and euphoric OGs, shills, and cultists? I like the idea of Bitcoin as well as the philosophy behind it, but there's a long road between 1BTC = $X? and 1BTC=1BTC and I don't yet know enough to not talk out of my a$$ so I want to know what technical arguments may be holding it back and could forever keep it in the speculative, quasi religious sector of the crypto asset class. Even tho the idea of a decentralized, unhackable network providing a medium of exchange for value transfer sounds and is amazing, I'm not quite sold that Bitcoin, being the first answer, is the final and best answer. Bitcoiners like to think they picked the next world reserve currency but doge coin, shib, and xmr folks think that too which is why I've been leaning away from crypto as a CURRENCY and have been focusing on token projects providing infrastructure, utility and interoperability with today's economy. Anywho it would be great if someone could plz point me to the ultimate Bitcoin fud post/comment/subreddit so I can weigh the bull case against an educated bear case.

Reality is a perception! -Elon Musk influence!!,"I've been in crypto for a while. I've seen many things ,but beyond all I was amazed by the fact how can a single man influence an entire industry,so this question occupied my mind all the time. How can Elon musk have such a big influence on crypto market, i did some research i looked some of his popular tweets and the charts, what i found out changed my way of thinking forever,i will never look at the world the same way i did especially financial markets. On Apr-May 2021 Elon made a move on doge coin the markets started crashing, at the meantime i had a analyse of btcusdt with some basic concepts like market structure and wyckoff distribution scheme,eventually i was correct on the analysis,and the volume divergences indicated that the market will fall rapidly. Sooooooo??? What if Elon doesn't influence the markets,he just knows the markets ,at least he has some good proffesional guys who knows the markets,everything is about timing,he knows there is a high probability that the markets will fall,he posts something about it to make it look like he is the captain and he makes the ship sink. With this move everybody will think he has influence in cryptomarkets, increasing his overall reputation ,benefiting him in other areas. FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT. Is this evil??? Non at all.He is definitely manipulating everybody,but at least he gives people a clue where the markets are going,since he can't give financial advice publicly, he does it in a indirect way, he acts like a strong indicator to crypto investors community with a high probability of being a good financial advice. If he tweets again i'll jump in his advice with no hasitation.",1,0,2023-04-27 10:10:55,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1), ('think silly blindly follow influencer especially elon', 2)]",reality perception elon musk influence ive crypto ive seen many things beyond amazed fact single man influence entire industryso question occupied mind time elon musk big influence crypto market research looked popular tweets charts found changed way thinking foreveri never look world way especially financial markets aprmay elon made move doge coin markets started crashing meantime analyse btcusdt basic concepts like market structure wyckoff distribution schemeeventually correct analysisand volume divergences indicated market fall rapidly sooooooo elon doesnt influence marketshe knows markets least good proffesional guys knows marketseverything timinghe knows high probability markets fallhe posts something make look like captain makes ship sink move everybody think influence cryptomarkets increasing overall reputation benefiting areas fake till make evil non allhe definitely manipulating everybodybut least gives people clue markets goingsince cant give financial advice publicly indirect way acts like strong indicator crypto investors community high probability good financial advice tweets ill jump advice hasitation
Why cryptocurrency will never be better than fiat (opinion),"First and foremost I am a meme stock trader, and I have so much Doge it hurts. So I want to make sure yall understand the level of legitimacy of which my stock/crypto/asset portfolibro exists. Now this is all in light hearted fun folks. I like both fiat and crypto. But what happens if the internet goes down? What happens if a country's bitcoin mining facilities get blown up during a war? What if I can't access my Doge??? Now I'm not saying banks are going to screw us over anyway lol what I'm saying is: at least for now, if the internet went down, I could go and withdraw fiat money. Or, if you're a silly goose like me and hide cash underneath the uh....I mean.....nevermind..... This is of course an open discussion. I would love more insight from those of you who actually know what you're talking about. Also I want to recognize how crypto is definitely worth it in the long run for stability, transferring funds super quick, etc. Not trying to shill out in crypto. Just sparking some discussion.

Going to be DCA another $10k or so over the next 3-6 months. Would you expect a 20x overall return by 2025 even if one of these goes bust? I feel like 20x would be conservative and would hope for closer to 50x. If that's the case should I reallocate or just start investing in more alt coins throughout the year Should I also scrap BTC because realistically from here we will probably only see a 3x Guessing I should stick to more alts",1,0,2023-04-27 19:45:16,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1)]",need x thoughts started k last month portfolio breakdown btc eth doge sol pepe rate portfolio would add going dca another k next months would expect x overall return even one goes bust feel like x would conservative would hope closer x thats case reallocate start investing alt coins throughout year also scrap btc realistically probably see x guessing stick alts
Was Mike Novogratz of Luna tattoo fame a guest Lecturer for Gary at MIT?,"A couple of years ago, while on Bloomberg Mike Novogratz name-dropped his old buddy Gary Gensler [he worked at Goldman with](https://twitter.com/LitecoinMag/status/1475288658194411524), and their connections, claiming (around 2m35s) that he was a guest lecturer for Gary at MIT. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GTj\_ciethI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GTj_ciethI) [Apparently one of the lectures, number 18, is missing and unseen](https://twitter.com/ZK_shark/status/1651316973832228865). I haven't noticed Mike lecturing in any of the old Gensler videos I've seen, so I wonder if perhaps it's this one, seemingly taken down for some reason. The search for this number 18 continues. I find this interesting as big fines hit celebrities and influencers for pitching unregistered securities. Many of these are people with little to no financial expertise, whose jobs are looking good, being tough or goofing off, being held to a pretty high standard by regulators. Meanwhile here's a wall street veteran running a publicly traded financial services business with, at a glance on google, what appears to be nearly $2 billion AUM, who is constantly going on international financial television and not only pitching things like EOS, LUNA and SOL, but I remember back in the day his main and sometimes only argument for EOS was Block One's $4 billion warchest. He was explicitly favoring coins FOR their centralization, which is precisely the thing most likely to get it flagged as a security. I remember when he suddenly got quiet about EOS, after it became clear blockone wasn't going to use that warchest to help it much, and also at the same time it got a decent number of users playing blockchain games on it. I.E., once it decentralized at least a little, he wanted nothing to do with it anymore. Did Mike Novogratz receive preferential allocations never available to the public from the progenitors of these centralized chains? In the dozens of interviews of him I've seen, I never saw him asked. Not his buy price, not where his stops were so that when they dumped, he wouldn't hurt like the muggles he was pitching these projects to. [Meanwhile actual journalists were begging stations not to feature Mike, because they knew his scam](https://twitter.com/laurasgoldman/status/1591560432715976704). And yet, no fines like the bobble headed celebs got. In a rational world you'd expect the financial expert and veteran to be held to a higher standard than the pretty celebrities. One thing is for sure, any special treatment mikey gets is NOT related to his friendship with regulators. I just want to make that clear. Take your tinfoil hat off. Interesting too are the projects Novogratz shorts. Love or hate Dogecoin, joke or not, it's at the very least a maximally decentralized joke. He openly claims to short it in the video at the top of the post. Novogratz has also ranted many times especially since 2019 about Litecoin, and contacted the community donation funded litecoin foundation then looking to either borrow coins from them or for names of litecoin whales he could borrow from off book (so it wouldn't show up on public order books) and shortly thereafter, once they explained they were a poor org working for donations not instafunded from massive premines like the foundations Mike is used to, and that they obviously wouldn't help him even if they had coins, he tweets out at a strategic moment in litecoin's last halving rally that it makes no sense and everyone should sell ltc. Gee, I wonder if he was short. When his long strategy started to waver (and coincidentally, just as LTC was starting to outperform, I suspect he had a long ethkiller, short ltc/doge strategy), he went on CNBC to demand they take Litecoin off their price chart and replace it with one of his projects, specifically naming SOL and LUNA. [They complied, for a while at least](https://twitter.com/LitecoinMag/status/1475288658194411524). Why short those? Precisely because there are no preferential allocations for guys like him to get early access to. They're legitimately decentralized chains where every coin went to secure the network, and thus wasn't available to hand out to hedgies. He can't even compete on even ground with poor randos like you and me despite the massive pile of cash he has and the ability to hire researchers and buy supercomputer time and privileged access to leverage and capital. He needs an extra guaranteed edge. Centralized chains that instantly mint massive percentages of their coins to hand out to insiders and wall street pushers are very distinct from Bitcoin and it's closest cousins. And while Bitcoin is too big for mike to push around, he has the resources to attack doge and ltc. At least for a while. TL;DR Why does it all matter? Everyone knows they're all corrupt, can't do anything about it. Maybe not. But sunlight ought to fall on these guys from time to time. Maybe at an absolute minimum someone here will remember who Novogratz is and not fall for his next dozen centralized garbage chains when he's pitching them with the help of friendly anchors on bloomberg, cnbc and yfi.",0,11,2023-04-27 22:46:01,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('hello noduhcache looks like might found new scam please report scam crossposting rcryptoscams rcryptoscamreport

Here are the potential prices Moons could reach!,"Have you ever wondered if Moons could moon? Well, it's possible and very likely to happen! Moons have a low market cap, which means that they still have a lot of space to grow even more! Here are the prices moons could reach if they had the same market cap as other big cryptocurrencies: # MONERO: If moons had the same market cap as monero, they would be worth around $26.40! That's a 118x price increase! &#x200B; # SHIB: If moons had the same market cap as shib, they would be worth around $56.72! That's a 256x increase in its price! &#x200B; # SOLANA: If moons had the same market cap as SOL, they would be worth $84.36! That would be a 381x price increase for moons! &#x200B; # DOGECOIN: If moons had the same market cap as DOGE, they would be worth approximately $104.45! That is a 472x price increase! &#x200B; Before heading to the top 3 market caps (excluding stable coins), here are some honorable mentions: Avalanche: $53.56 Litecoin: $60.91 Matic: $86.30 Cardano: $132.56 XRP: $228.79 The honorable mentions list is over, now let's head to the top 3! &#x200B; # BNB: If Moons had the same market cap as BNB, they would be worth an amazing $477.24!

Anyone think 90-96% of the time it's the whales who make bank?,"A lot of people enter crypto as a potential way to make big money and don't get me wrong, that is clearly still possible. With the right long term hold you never know- if you have an early equivalent like something like Google or Microsoft used to be, you could technically be early enough on something for big rises in the future. 📈 That said there are no guarantees like with most things. But I imagine historically it is usually the whales who walk away laughing with big blobs of money. To add to that I think a lot of times they may be what's manipulating the market- including even regular stocks. 👕 To give the most simple analogy- This fat whale put 10 million dollars into doge or bitcoin- the market gets excited- over a number of days, weeks or months depending on market conditions, people start to poor money, especially shrimps like many of us and the next thing you know the market dipped like a volcano while the 🐋 walk away happy with literally 10's or 100's of thousands dollars in easy profit while many of us feel bad about the few hundred or thousands of dollars we

After 2 years, 66% of the currencies in the list are still there. Somtimes in a different order of course. I believe this is quite a lot in a volatile market as crypto with many scams going around. &#x200B; Obvious disappearances from the list include: Terra (LUNA), FTX Token (FTT) and Celsius (CEL). Surprising newcomers that were not in the top 50 two years ago include Shiba Inu (INU) and Polygon (MATIC). * The Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) are also still surviving. As stated in the original post, It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list. If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment! &#x200B; 1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ""online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."" 2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change. 3. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, for now... 4. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange. 5. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT. 6. Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don't see a future for it after SEC went after it. 7. Cardano (ADA): another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software. 8. Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! Good job Elon! 9. Polygon (MATIC): provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues. 10. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications. 11. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data. 12. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin's cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees. 13. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance (created by Paxos), tied to USD, for now 14. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on. 15. Shiba Inu (SHIB): also dubbed ""Dogecoin killer"", basically the little meme brother 16. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable. 17. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar. 18. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It's just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications. 19. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct. 20. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an ""internet of blockchains"". 21. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 22. Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it's an exchange like Binance, just decentralized. 23. OKB (OKB): the native token of OKEx exchange. 24. Monero (XMR): if you need drugs (jokes aside, it's a coin focussed on privacy) 25. Ethereum Classic (ETC): technically the original Ethereum network 26. Internet Computer (ICP): blockchain network that aims to provide a decentralized version of cloud computing 27. Toncoin (TON): formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network. 28. Stellar (XLM): fast processing times and low fees 29. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability 30. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services. 31. Aptos (APT): A privacy-focused cryptocurrency, dubbed as ""Solana Killer"", many red flags were mentioned though 32. TrueUSD (TUSD): another stablecoin 33. Cronos (CRO): the native token of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange 34. Hedera (HBAR): a public distributed ledger that uses a hashgraph consensus algorithm 35. Lido DAO (LDO): a decentralized finance protocol that enables staking of Ethereum 2.0 36. Arbitrum (ARB): a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions (for MOONS!) 37. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): yet another blockchain platform that aims to enable decentralized applications with low fees and high performance 38. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they're using it. 39. ApeCoin (APE): a decentralized finance project (if you like bananas, try Banano instead) 40. Quant (QNT): a blockchain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks. 41. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. 42. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data. 43. Fantom (FTM): blockchain platform that enables fast and cheap transactions 44. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 45. The Sandbox (SAND): a blockchain-based virtual world, fading into the ""sands"" of time 46. MultiversX (EGLD): Previously known as ""ELROND"". Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism 47. Decentraland (MANA): A virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain 48. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave. 49. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network. 50. Stacks (STX): a blockchain platform that enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Bitcoin network.",9,22,2023-04-29

Thoughts on keeping meme coins on exchanges,"So lately we have all seen how important is to have coins in self custody. And I agree with that. But I did notice something. 2 times so far when Elon did something connecting Twitter and Dogecoin, DOGE pumped. And I had my DOGE in a hardware wallet tucked away somewhere inconvenient so I prevent myself from impulse selling stuff. I could sell at the spike, there was quite a low chance that the price will remain there. But it would take some time to get my Ledger and send it to exchange and sell it. So I didn't do it because I am a miserable hodler (with the exception mentioned in my other post). I realised something. If you own a memecoin, it might be actually smart to keep memecoins such as SHIB and DOGE on exchange in order to react to those ridiculus spikes. At least to take advantage, sell and maybe later buy more at lower price, ergo accumulating said coin. So you wanna say: ""What if the exchange goes to shit and I lose my funds?"" First of all: You have to be a special degenerate and gambler to have a high percentage of your portfolio in memecoins. Second: If you do have a large amount in meme coins, that would mostly mean you also have a lot of money already to be playing around with it like that so I guess a potential loss like that wouldnt change your life for the worse.l So tell me if I missed something important here?",14,86,2023-04-30 15:40:13,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE,"[('first probably shouldnt memecoins case agree keeping exchanges

Dragon Ball Z Meets Crypto: Comparing top Cryptocurrencies to DBZ Characters,"Inspired by [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/134141d/lets\_play\_a\_game\_which\_anime\_character/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/134141d/lets_play_a_game_which_anime_character/) I decided to make my own list of some of the top cryptos and how they match DBZ characters. https://preview.redd.it/nlwcnpzaa7xa1.png?width=2480&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c37d6ad00167d9ce9fc594e4a154ff3a76797f17 1. Bitcoin (BTC) - Goku: Just like Goku, Bitcoin is the strongest and most powerful crypto currency in the world. It has survived multiple attacks and has proven to be extremely resilient. 2. Ethereum (ETH) - Vegeta: Like Vegeta, Ethereum is the second strongest crypto currency in the world. It's constantly striving to be the best and improve itself, even if it means taking risks. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) - Piccolo: Piccolo is a powerful and reliable ally to the Z fighters, just like Binance Coin is a reliable cryptocurrency for traders and investors. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) - Hercule: Hercule is a lovable but often underestimated character in the DBZ universe, just like Dogecoin is a meme-based crypto currency that people initially thought was a joke but has since gained a following. 5. Cardano (ADA) - Gohan: Gohan starts off as a timid character but grows into a strong and powerful fighter, just like Cardano is a relatively new crypto currency that has shown great potential. 6. XRP (XRP) - Frieza: Frieza is a powerful villain in the DBZ universe, just like XRP has been embroiled in controversies and legal battles. 7. Polkadot (DOT) - Android 17: Android 17 is a powerful and versatile fighter who can adapt to any situation, just like Polkadot is a platform that can connect multiple blockchains. 8. Internet Computer (ICP) - Cell: Cell is a powerful but unpredictable villain in the DBZ universe, just like the Internet Computer is a new and innovative crypto currency that has yet to prove itself. 9. Solana (SOL) - Future Trunks: Future Trunks is a character from a dystopian future who comes to the present to prevent disaster, just like Solana is a crypto currency that aims to solve scalability issues. 10. Chainlink (LINK) - Krillin: Krillin is a reliable ally to the Z fighters and is known for his resourcefulness, just like Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable data to smart contracts.

Crypto disappoints me greatly with meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even. I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with. I think it makes the space look immature and basically slows adoption by directing focus onto such nonsense. Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing. If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso. And I really know deep in my heart a rug is coming, either that or they just suck the life out of it as more liquidity replaces the old suckers. If you want to contribute to something like this, you are the reason we are laughed at as a community. They don't see the good projects in the mainstream, only the jokes. And this is one of the biggest jokes yet, same as any meme coin before it. If you want to actively work against the community as a whole, what better way than to support this crap. Downvote me all you want I'm just sick of these shitty meme coins dominating the news when we should be focusing on more important matters, like the fucking recession coming. But hey let's just get distracted by a fucking frog right? Edit: I legitimately think pepe people are coming into these posts and downvoting them to keep this stuff silent.

It needs 1 bull market and 1 bear market to learn the ropes,"Crypto was a trial and error story for me. I was aware of crypto since 2017, but crypto and even financials doesn't interest me. This changed 2021 with the mem coin hype around DOGE and the bullmarket back then. It caught my attention, I wanted to profit like all those tubers and influencers did and started investing gambling into crypto. Why I say gambling? Because I had zero knowledge what crypto is or what it is about. Zero. My trials and errors included falling victim to pump&dumps, rugpulls, hacks, wrong transactions, paying insane gas fees, paying insane gas fees twice (...because signing this and confirming that or putting too low gas fee so tx doesn't go through...), buying the tops and buying into dipping dips, FOMO. But the most important lesson, I've learnt in the bear market...DYOR, steady investment, keeping emotions out of it. I'm not saying that I am an expert now, still learning. The next lesson I hope I can master (and hoping that I will be able to) is to actually take profits in a bullmarket.

"Is the COLLECTIBLE side of NFTs market getting a little delusional? Can peak hype and ATHs be reached again? Here's why it may no longer reach those highs, even with a crypto bull market, and why the NFT collectible market is still struggling despite the crypto rally.","# Intro. While I think NFTs have some potential in some areas like ticketing, I'm talking here about the collectible side, where you have a JPG attached to it, and trade them like Pokemon cards. The NFT collectible market has been spiraling down, with value plummeting. Its own bull market and hype train was actually pretty brief, spiked quickly, and then months later people were already struggling with even the hot collections. But a lot of people have said ""Don't worry, it will bounce back"", ""we will get back to ATH, just like Bitcoin"", ""once crypto exits its bear market, we're gonna start seeing huge spiked in NFT sales"". I'm starting to really doubt it, and maybe even see some delusion in that line of thinking. We've had more than 3 months of cryptocurrency rally, and still no sign of the NFT market stopping its downfall. &#x200B; # Misunderstanding of NFTs as something being able to follow the rest of the crypto market. There's already a big flaw in that thinking, and in believing it will be just like cruptocurrencies. That if Bitcoin goes back to ATH, then why not some of the big NFT collections? NFTs aren't currency. They're not fungible, and don't act like a digital currency you can easily trade like Bitcoin, or use to buy a coffee. NFTs act more like something you trade on eBay. You don't go on an exchange like Coinbase to trade them, you go on a marketplace like Opensea. The dynamics are different, and the market is different. &#x200B; # It's already showing signs that it no longer follows the crypto market, and is behaving differently. I wouldn't rely too much on the hopes that a crypto bull market will make many NFT collections go back to their peak prices again. At best, the bull market will introduce new collections that will spike and fall quickly. But it might not necessarily resurrect old ones. The big spike in the NFT market happened during the crypto bull market. For a brief time, it looked like it could be in tandem with the crypto market. But it increasingly looked like it was more of the initial hype coinciding at the time with the height of the last bull market. But not actually following crypto's double top. And then the hype quickly fizzled out. This heavily depended on NFT being a new thing. Now, we're starting to get a better picture, and are seeing early signs that NFTs can't keep up with the crypto market. Despite the crypto market emerging from the bear market, and rallying for the past few months, NFTs hasn't been able to do the same, and keeps losing momentum. &#x200B; # They depend too much on hype and novelty. While it's true that some cryptos, like meme coins like Doge also have a big dependency on hype, with NFTs it's on a much bigger scale. With Doge, if the hype dies down, you still have a currency, and you can go spend it at AMC, Newegg, Gamestop, etc... With NFTs, if the hype dies down, you are left with a collectible that no one wants to collect. It's now a paper weight with no weight. &#x200B; # The market keeps getting more over saturated. In the beginning, hype was able to fuel massive price and sales spikes. It was a brand new type of collectible and a new type of technology. There weren't that many well known collections. That's why the big collections like Bored Apes, were able to initially get all the focus and sales. And be the ""household names"". But that didn't last. The market quickly turned from one collection to the next. And pretty soon, people started to realize that anyone and their dogs could make their own collection. The market became over saturated with one collection after another. And it hasn't stopped. &#x200B; # Even stars are struggling to sell their collections now. When the market became saturated, and collections struggled to sell, and prices started to plummet, the ones still able to sell their collections were stars. Having a famous name serve as an influencer helped some collections stand out. But that also didn't last. Musician Grimes who was Elon Musk girlfriend, also saw her NFT collection drop by 84%. Snoop Dogg's NFT initially had a floor price of $1.9K, now the floor price dropped to $81. Collections from many football (soccer) starts from Paul Pogba to John Terry, have seen the value of their collection drop 70%-90%. Even celebrity endorsed collections like Bored Bunny, Trollz, Rich Dwarves Tribe, all tanked. Now celebrities from Paris Hilton to Gwyneth Paltrow, are being sued for shilling NFTs that all tanked and lost people a lot of money. &#x200B; # What will it take for collectible NFTs to bounce back? It's very possible that a crypto market rally won't be enough on its own. The last few months of Bitcoin rallying hasn't even been able to stop the NFT market bleeding. Even the star power is no longer able to lift the NFT market. The big spike we saw in 2021, was depending too much on hype, star power, and collectible NFTs being this new thing. It had the ""new tech"" factor, which has now mostly faded. And overall, it depended too much on one thing: being a collectible. It might be time for a new generation of NFTs to offer something a little more of value, with actual functions and utility. We've seen how NFTs can be used to download music, enter special events, own something in the real world, etc... This is really where NFTs need to go, if they want to be more than Beanie Babies that will fade away.",9,41,2023-05-05 15:02:32,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('think nft world need utility instead hype

It is kind of discouraging to see that tech and utility doesn't mean close as much as hype and memes.,"Today's memecoin surge just once again proves that tech and utility of the token doesn't matter much to people investing into coins. How many great and exciting projects with so many new utilities and uses have been nothing but disappointments with their constant price decreases over the time, and then comes a stupid frog token that clearly states in its whitepaper it has no utility, that it's a shitcoin, and it just goes to the moon in few days. Currently this coin is in top 40 of market cap and keeps rising.

You think the current memecoin frenzy is dumb now? I have a dumb prediction for when the next bull run comes and crazier amounts of dumb money inevitably flow in.,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It's time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun. Look, you can scream ""scam"" and ""rugpull"" all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market's euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino. Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat. There currently aren't many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there's a good chance the next memecoin king doesn't even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can! While it's uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today's memecoin investors are tomorrow's BTC and ETH investors. TL;DR - I'm making a dumb prediction for a dumb market.",73,151,2023-05-05 18:26:43,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY,"[('hello turbulentmoon looks like might found new scam please report scam crossposting

TRON and SHIBA INU are top 15 coins. How can we take the crypto market seriously like this?,"According to Coinmarketcap TRON sits at spot 13 and SHIBA INU at spot 15. If that's not bad enough, we have DOGE at 8, SOL, which is down more than it is running, at 10! Also, Tether, USDC and BNB... To be honest, at the current stage it seems to me 95% of coins in the market has no real utility or intrinsic value. What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How can people not see the crypto market like a large online betting site when everything gains value from short time speculation and manipulation and when the price isn't really correlated with the quality of the product. It's just all the hype (looking at you PEPE). Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever. The longer I'm in the crypto market the more I'm leaning toward just BTC and ETH and the more I lost hope in the community.

I made the mistake of putting some in doge back in the day so I really don't want to burn money and do that again... but my question is: How do people research and find these super low, unheard of coins? Where are they? And most importantly, if they're not listed on big exchanges, how do you invest in them? I really have no idea how people are finding Pepe at a fraction of a dollar, investing, and selling all before it's mainstream and listed on popular sites. I realize you're all geniuses on here so this question is like an insult, however the internet isn't telling me much and I'm no trying to click on a scam link just to answer this question for myself

"Thinking back, what would you have done if you could have anticipated the fall of the bullrun and the beginning of the bear winter?","I think it's pretty simple. From September 2020 to April 2021, there was a big surge in crypto values, followed by a big drop until July 2021, and then the resumption of the rise until November 2021. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lb8ex1pl60za1.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8362170eb8cdeb0ea874a9c167f501920d7f808f So imagine coming back at the end of 2021, to a time when DOGE and the incredible rise in crypto values had brought in a lot of new people, to a time when Terra Luna was just starting its rise and SHIB was exploding. A time when BTC was almost at $70,000 and all the ""influencers"" were selling the dream with an explosion of values until the end of the year. Nothing seemed to stop the crypto anymore. One morning, while looking at your wallet, and watching the news, a feeling takes you to the stomach, for you, some signs are alarming, you feel the end of the bull run, and you foresee the end of the cycle with a severe and brutal fall over several years.

Is it dumb to invest in Doge?,"It's probably the second or third most well-known coin in the world mainly due to the hype it accumulated. It's still sitting in the top 10 by market cap even after a long time of a bear market. I think it's safe to say that you could invest in it a bit because inevitably people are going to ape into it again. Right now it's sitting at 1/10th of its ATH which, to me at least, could mean that it could 10x again. I know it's a pretty useless coin, but to be honest the most important aspect of a coin is for it to get hype, at least that's how I see it... I mean look at Pepe, everyone, especially mainstream people, sees crypto as coins with pretty logos and they'll invest in whatever they think makes them money, which is why I was thinking of getting a bit of Doge every now and then. What do you say? I think it's a gamble, but a safe gamble to say the least.

"We call them ""memecoins"" but there's no meme or fun in them as it is.

And the house always wins.","Maybe back in the day many years ago these used to be memecoins. Dogecoin was funny when no one paid attention to crypto and prices were super low. Back them most people actually viewed it as a joke. But no one was FOMOing life savings in Doge hoping to get rich. Maybe. But today it is definitely different. There's no fun, there's no meme. Most of the 'investors' are throwing significant portions of savings, even all of it into these tokens hoping to get rich. Most of whom end up broke and/or heavy bags. At the end of the day these are not ""memecoins"". They are high risk gambles or a bet. The only people who really benefit are the insiders and devs who act like the house.

Yea, yea, I know that we're still in a bear market, but it won't last forever. Now more use cases are found on the older proof of work chains starting with the ""Ordinals"" and BTC-20 tokens. Now LTC and its LTC-20 token comes. Will soon DOGE get its DOGE-20?! When people try out this, discover new possibilities; we maybe will slowly and steadily enter a bullmarket.

People on this sub don't get this.,"I'll make this short and to the point. This post is about memecoins and the hate surrounding it. Everyone is saying that the only people who profited off of pepe are insiders and early investors. In reality, normal people who didnt get any inside info actually made money on coins like pepe and doge and other shitcoins. Even i was lucky to get on the hype train at the right time and made some profit. As someone said, great investments doesn't always mean great businesses. This is more true in crypto. Unless you're in it just for the tech which i highly doubt, you have no reason to hate it or the insiders who made profit off of it. Try to understand the ongoing trend and ride the wave. I'm not encouraging anyone to put your money in memecoins now, but just outright hating anything won't make you learn a thing. Just look at those people in buttcoin sub as an example. Don't be like them. Edit: saying this again, I'm not encouraging anyone to buy, even i won't buy any other meme coin again. Its just that i saw people hating it like anything, while at the same time some were putting their money in and took profits. So Just putting out my perspective.",0,161,2023-05-13 16:07:17,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('memecoin maxi cones', 11), ('normal people didnt get inside info actually made money coins like pepe doge

Who Accepts Dogecoin as Payment? 8 Places You Can Spend DOGE,,1,2,2023-05-13 19:16:04,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL,[],accepts dogecoin payment places spend doge
Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down. Have fun guys and don't forget to never spend more money gambling then you can afford to lose or are willing to lose.",77,479,2023-05-13 23:37:17,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('hello mkultrahigh looks

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases. In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice. Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation, even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation. If we would have 2 or 3 coins in total, we would be years backward in terms of tech and usecases.",22,47,2023-05-15 17:05:31,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('two coins btc eth anyway multiple coins good

Why I'm short since 31k yet not bearish overall,"I haven't made a TA post in here for a long time but I've seen a lot of people being a bit confused about recent price action so I thought I share my thoughts. DISCLAIMER: This is not a financial advice. Technical Analysis is just a part of a traders arsenal to take positions and predict future price action. Investors & market sentiment, macro economic conditions & sudden news always require to stay sharp and possibly change strategies. Although this is representing a current technical analysis things can always change completely tomorrow. This is an educational & entertaining post but not to take serious as a guaranteed outcome of future price action. WHY The main reason for my short positions was the heavy rejection of 30k+. The current macro conditions are uncertain. Although you could argue that a chance of a mild recession and declining inflation is priced in, we are still in uncertain territory. What if the recession comes in hotter than expected? What if inflation doesn't cool down and it requires the fed to remain more hawkish? Although Bitcoin is known as ""the bluechip of Crypto"" it still remains a very risky asset when you consider all assets. Uncertainty is usually driving investors to less risky assets such as bonds or bluechip stocks ( which is a reason for the recent AAPL & MSFT strength ) but also other high market cap stocks. If BTC bleeds over the next week I expect it to also further drag down the alt coin market.On top of that Liquidity is still a very underappreciated indicator reflecting price action and it remains low and on a decline current trend on the BTC 4h chart: https://preview.redd.it/f6y9e30ss70b1.png?width=2537&format=png&auto=webp&s=821e44a9c97242297e963620b8bd71f2a71d78c8 First the 31k area was rejected. I've exited my longs there from the oversold ( ridiculous ) USDC drama and decided to sit on the sidelines from there and watch. No short position yet. Afterwards there was another run up to the 30k area and the rejection was even heavier especially with the sharp drop that one day that some of you might remember causing a -7% dip. The days after it continous to fail breaking through and holding the 30k area. After the last attempt and another clean rejection on high Volume I've decided to take my short positions on BTC & mutliple Alt coins. The orange circle shows a called ""Liquidity clear out"" known term & move by market makers or general oversold condition in the trading world. It moves the price sharply for a short period of time below the ""support area"" that retail uses for their stop losses. Market Makers & traders are aware about this and move purposely the price below that area causing a liquidation cascade. The high volume is very attractive for larger players to buy up and fill their positions while traders notice it and jump in scalping the reversal. This is why we saw a sharp bounce immediately after and an uptrend since then. Short positions have been opened on the way up coming from a short chasing retail sentiment which have been squeezed towards the 27,500 area.visible short squeeze towards 27,500 https://preview.redd.it/5z9bzyejx70b1.png?width=2504&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c8024fb56c0557289b788cb58311bc98c0552a9 the 27,500-27,600 area is an important one for traders. What used to act as support has now become ressistance which is why many traders have taken profit around that area. I was waiting for it to break and hold above as well but unfortunately it was again rejected and fell below. If broken & price held above it might indicate a reversal in the trend. long term chart showing the importance of the area https://preview.redd.it/zigc1zhnx70b1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=83a792a4b682ca8a94e474fd93e5d3748d5004b5 closer look at the chart yesterday proving the point how much of a ressistance that area is : https://preview.redd.it/lugk72xdy70b1.png?width=2549&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd7f04242bf663e3bef92b9678c0780e192739c The main reason for my short positions was the heavy rejection of 30k+.

Also visible on the VIX chart which is referred to as the ""fear gauge"" which hit this month a low last seen in the middle of the bullrun 2021. VIX chart ""fear gauge"" https://preview.redd.it/cposx5x3u70b1.png?width=2491&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffa5abd035a16c4015e2e8d894e43c1092ac4505 The NQ100 ( top 100 tech stock ) chart also approaching the last year august highs: https://preview.redd.it/jsf26s8f380b1.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcaa83cfcbfedc57284f7946059807f64f05e26d The SPX has been struggling reaching 4200 for quite some time https://preview.redd.it/o82t43ok380b1.png?width=2541&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8bb878731beb58d3b6e55e37aa6a29573c763c2 The DXY chart also looking like it's recovering here with a potentially double bottom. DXY represents the Dollar Strength. Bitcoin but also the stock market usually react inversed to it. ( falling DXY -> rising assets, rising DXY -> falling assets ) https://preview.redd.it/gdmk76d2980b1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e018af24bd545d0e9ec3468a7854771486c9e75 So I've taken a short position in BTC, ETH but mostly in alt coins. One of the main reason is the strong shift towards Bitcoin in the general crypto sentiment. Although some alt coins have outperformed BTC there is a clear trend visible since the start of the bear market if you exclude stablecoins: BTC dominance chart excluding stablecoins: https://preview.redd.it/fobn7jfgv70b1.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c759c5b8817ab29e7af0e72c5c9dbcba36be9e Which is even more visible when you compare the BTC chart with the Altcoin chart excluding BTC & ETH BTC chart: https://preview.redd.it/4ldg7satv70b1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f9c54daf5880f6a0f889f0e0e74771bd7c7d218 Alt coin chart excluding BTC & ETH https://preview.redd.it/gb5jb2qpv70b1.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=18ece39a2ec6e0cf61814e2dc4e8217d5feebd90 My target My target would be the 200 moving average indicator on the daily chart which should be reached around \~24k in the next week if the trend continous. Then I'll pay attention whether it breaks or bounces off as strong support. https://preview.redd.it/hdg14ao4280b1.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=367e71615a5b5c904f19a42a6efeb4c819f1c128 my bullish counter arguments against my own play: That being said I'm still skeptical about my own positions. There is still a high chance that the recent interest in BTC will continue and trigger a reversal. Very interesting to me was the strength during the banking crisis and the correlation with Gold. I think this is something very underappreciated & undervalued that many people haven't noticed yet. In case you diddn't know yet GOLD is the ""most valueable asset"" globally with a market cap of $13.1+ Trillion. When investors treat BTC with a market cap of ""only"" 524 Billion similar to GOLD there could be way more demand coming during a crisis. https://preview.redd.it/mfez8r6uy70b1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=940499f1431ea2d8fdbc00778864abbc089d250b BTC & GOLD correlation during the banking crisis https://preview.redd.it/6apg5kdnz70b1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1776b8b88a934b4a867ebbd1c30f24a8bf53f83f Inflation Something also important to keep in mind is that although inflation is cooling down, it remains high.VENEZUELA 155% ARGENTINA 104% TURKEY 43% NIGERIA 22% UNITED KINGDOM 10.1% Germany +7.4% FRANCE 5.9% INDIA 5.6% UNITES STATES 4.9% BRAZIL 4.6% CANADA 4.3% INDONESIA 4.3% RUSSIA 3.5% JAPAN 3.2% Bitcoin: 1.74% https://preview.redd.it/mhy50su5080b1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=08945f3236880863ed0a51a7dc975ea905931d43 And that is before the halving. So overall BTC is still winning the race in value against majority of currencies. Remember, the super wealthy target stability not really becoming richer. They want to win the race against inflation and not sit on their wealth that loses buying power overtime. BTC will remain attractive especially with the incoming halving. CONCLUSION: For me personally we had a nice little bear market rally that brought back some beautiful and enjoyable bull market vibes. We had Memecoins & Shitcoins pumping, Musk tweeting NFTs that catapult in prices same as changing the Twitter Logo causing a huge DOGE Pump & Dump. However the macro conditions and fundamentals are still not looking great. This isn't 2020 / 2021 and the outlook for it to be similar in the near future is just not there. Therefore I remain bearish on crypto overall, neutral on BTC with a short term bearish outlook but bullish overall for the future of crypto. Thanks for reading and always remember - it's a marathon not a race. Growing capital overtime and increasing your buying power on low risk strategies will most likely benefit you way more than trying to take a short cut with high risk strategies that end up decreasing your buying power / capital.",37,64,2023-05-16 16:45:51,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('measuring inflation basket goods demand goods services purchased urban consumers excluding food energy inflation

Friends in the US who visit companies such as AMC or Starbucks. Do you pay with Crypto?,"A question for our US friends really, just wondering if you use Crypto day to day at companies that offer payment by this route? Something jolted in my memory whilst at the Cinema the other day that AMC, made news a year or so ago about taking cryptocurency payments (BTC/LTC/ETH). They also sell giftcards via Bitpay and accept Doge. But I can't see any update on how this has gone, if it's used and adopted better or if it's just almost a 'gimmick' of the chain to appeal to it's retail investors back in the memestock heyday. The CEO tweeted when it was announced something that seemed bullish at first, reading as if 14% of online transactions were from Crypto.. ""Big newsflash! As promised, many new ways NOW to pay online at AMC. We proudly now accept: drumroll, please... Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin. Also Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal. Incredibly, they already account for 14% of our total online transactions! Dogecoin next."" But I think reading it properly it means Crypto/Apple Pay/Google Pay/Paypal combined account for 14% of their total transactions? TechCrunch had an article in April last year pointing otu that the AMC App now accepts DOGE/SHIB [https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/the-amc-mobile-app-for-u-s-theaters-now-accepts-dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-other-cryptocurrencies/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/the-amc-mobile-app-for-u-s-theaters-now-accepts-dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-other-cryptocurrencies/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALgj-barFmHRaHw20J4RmvFNDThLyfW1Cp-4IgUDfyBy9ZiP7fOYZjua-hY2QPJTmX4Pej9S8QLEXdW_JsDbUntzoOaWP4LSbfEW3Pz3rjpxqGvwljRZhH7iKf93Wme591DwDEtvBK_D7ReZEu1bD3cnEWPbdky2yT1tZm05XKnd) There's also other large companies in the US like Starbucks and Wholefoods that take payments so just wondering if people do actually pay with Crypto or not? It seems a good thing that would only help adoption, but I'm not sure how easy it is to do with this companies or the fees involved, or if there are third party apps involved.

"I bought $1k of the Top 10 Cryptos on January 1st, 2023 (APRIL Update/Month 4/+36%)","https://preview.redd.it/j8ess4v4i01b1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=3edcc90abcfd4c1cb40990b56adfa1d9d6c089d5 Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4). Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 4th monthly report for the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, and LTC. SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAY Snapshot). tl;dr What's this all about? I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for almost 5.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include stablecoins) [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/). Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/). APRIL Highlights: \- BNB wins the month. Bitcoin is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by ADA in second place. The 2023 portfolio is +36% so far this year. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period (see below for details). New feature: for the fourth straight month, total market cap token AMKT outperforms my Top Ten in April and is +63% vs. the Top Ten's +36% in 2023 in this year's friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). ## Month Four - Up +36% https://preview.redd.it/eldew7vxi01b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1fd8eaad773aefb08a1b89df4a3fc0946170414 The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC. April highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: Another mixed month for the 2023 Top Ten, the third straight after an all-green [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1). BNB's \+6% was enough for an April victory. ETH and BTC were the only other two coins in positive territory. Bitcoin is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by ADA in second place. ## April Ranking and Dropouts Here's a look at the movement in the ranks four months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment: https://preview.redd.it/zlp9nxdzi01b1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0f94d9c18abfd0863b606d3e629891a1af06b74 Remarkably steady so far during the first 120 days of 2023, with only BUSD dropping out of the original portfolio, replaced by SOL. ## April Winner and Loser April Winner - BNB's modest gain (+6%) was enough to win in April. April Loser - For the second time in a row, MATIC was the worst performing crypto of the group, falling -12% this month. ## Overall Update: BTC maintains lead, ADA moves into second place, all crypto in the green. Every crypto in this year's Experiment is still in positive territory. BTC holds on to the top spot after overtaking MATIC for the lead last month. The initial $100 invested in BTC four months ago is worth $172 today. ADA is next, +57% since New Year's Day. DOGE is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, but is still in the green at +12% for the year. Much wow. ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023: https://preview.redd.it/6igkssr0j01b1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9fa6b3bd33ebcf8726cf2d16e2b19b252b64951 The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio lost $40 in April. The initial $1000 investment on New Year's Day 2023 is now worth $1,362. Here's a visual summary of the progress so far: https://preview.redd.it/hyg2kvw1j01b1.png?width=247&format=png&auto=webp&s=b32f7bfe999e85c7de03eb810abf31f93c1c360c ## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) New feature this year - The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market. Much has changed in the last 5+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)). This year's friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). AMKT is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index. Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market - exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start. Here's the question I'm tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund? On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT. Four months into the Experiment, here's the AMKT snapshot: https://preview.redd.it/0t86tfg3j01b1.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7654a696f40ab34b5db232f112ebc33b6151d18 April Performances: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: -3% AMKT: +0% The April monthly victory goes to: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) Overall since January 1st, 2023: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: current value $1,362 (+36%) AMKT: current value $1,628 (+63%) Overall lead: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) For the more visual, here's the table I'll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. AMKT competition this year: https://preview.redd.it/z0chnsq4j01b1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e66f8c5380f7c6fb70fc9077778c2e616d6dd74 ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios The 2023 Top Ten is one of six concurrent experimental portfolios. Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -36% (total value $639) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +227% (total value $3,267) [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +399% (total value $4,989) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +95% (total value $1,955) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $311) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +36% (total value $1,362) Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $12,523. That's up +109% on the combined portfolios. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021's all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%. Here's the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals: https://preview.redd.it/096sow16j01b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1f6b64569cf7a5d837dc5438fa19706f832f9a In summary: That's a +109% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/55dqgn97j01b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b5fefb64f3859059474f587e886d184293fc716 The S&P 500 is up +9% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year's Day would be worth $1,090 had it been redirected to the S&P. Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I've been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,560 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,660 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,290 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,110 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,090 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,580. That is up +26% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +109% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: https://preview.redd.it/4gugoer8j01b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7e1fb7292ab8993358eefc3b27e40087ef7e50 ## Conclusion: To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. A reporting note: I'll focus on 2023 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.

"I have recently left a post(why newbies hate crypto) here and saw too many negative comments about cryptocurrency so I only have one question to most people who are in this sub, '' What the HELL are you doing here? ''","1. Commenter 1: I don't own any crypto and I don't think I'd leave money or crypto on an exchange except for short term trading. But if I ever buy crypto again I will keep it on a hardware wallet 2. Commenter 2 : Why? Because most of it is straight garbage, and the amount of garbage in the crypto space multiplies every day. It's getting worse as time goes by, not better. Seriously. It's taken far more steps backward than forward over the past few years 3. Commenter 3: TA? Come on man 4. Commenter 4(replied to another commenter who said people hear what they do not know) : People also fear the blood-covered naked guy running down the street with an assault rifle in each hand 5. Commenter 5: Deep down you know it's mostly bollocks 6. Commenter 6: Put down the pipe 7. Commenter 7: Cryptocurrencies are dead assets that do no work and buying them is speculation, not investment 8. Commenter 8: Bitcoin is the exact same as doge, do you consider bitcoin just as bad? The only differences are block sizes and how much can be mined but doge has not been hitting artificial limits yet. Aren't I supposed to believe in crypto now that I am in the market? Aren't we supposed to believe in it and support it? What if newbies read negative comments and think of it as scam while it's not and you know it! I have no problems with warning people about shitcoins and scam coins in the market but DON'T YOU tell me that Btc is not legit, Eth is not legit, I know 99% are scam coins but still there are many legit projects out there, why do many people hate on crypto at the same time they spread FUD and call it scam? Wouldn't it mislead the noobs? I know we're in the bear market and I clearly know that I(as crypto investor) will be getting bullied until the beginning of the bull market.

Hardware comparing Model T vs Nano X,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X. Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides. Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods. The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely. Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware? (Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing) &#x200B; Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices. &#x200B; &#x200B; # Security chip The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances). Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this. &#x200B; # Size of the memory Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB &#x200B; # Supported coins Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens. Note the table below I took the info from [https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets) [https://trezor.io/coins](https://trezor.io/coins) and had a thing help me make the table. They both support ERC20 and BEP20. Meaning any token that is that, both will support. I'm not going through every token to make sure it matches this. I'm only looking at the sites. &#x200B; |Coin|Model T (Trezor)|Nano X (Ledger)| |:-|:-|:-| |BTC|Supported|Supported| |ETH & ERC20|Supported|Supported| |XRP|Supported|Supported| |BCH|Supported|Supported| |DOT|Not Supported|Supported| |LTC|Supported|Supported| |BNB & BEP20|Supported|Supported| |EOS|Supported|Supported| |XTZ|Supported|Supported| |XLM|Supported|Supported| |LINK|Supported|Supported| |COMP|Supported|Supported| |ADA|Supported|Supported| |TRX|Not Supported|Supported| |LEO|Supported|Supported| |XMR|Supported|Supported| |HT|Supported|Supported| |ETC|Supported|Supported| |USDT (ERC20)|Supported|Supported| |DASH|Supported|Not Supported| |USDC|Supported|Not Supported| |NEO|Not Supported|Supported| |CRONOS|Supported|Not Supported| |XEM|Not Supported|Supported| |HEDG|Not Supported|Supported| |MIOTA|Not Supported|Supported| |ATOM|Not Supported|Supported| |AXS (ERC20)|Supported|Not Supported| |ZEC|Supported|Supported| |OKB|Supported|Supported| |LUNA|Not Supported|Supported| |MKR|Not Supported|Supported| |ICP|Not Supported|Supported| |FIL|Not Supported|Supported| |ONT|Not Supported|Supported| |DOGE|Supported|Supported| |APE|Supported|Not Supported| |EGLD|Not Supported|Supported| |ALGO|Not Supported|Supported| |FTT|Not Supported|Supported| |APT|Not Supported|Supported| |BAT|Supported|Supported| |CRV|Not Supported|Supported| |VET|Not Supported|Supported| |USDP|Supported|Not Supported| |DGB|Supported|Not Supported| |UNI|Supported|Supported| |BUSD (ERC20)|Supported|Not Supported| |BTG|Supported|Supported| |SHIB (ERC20)|Supported|Not Supported| |GALA|Supported|Not Supported| |COMP|Supported|Not Supported| |GRT|Supported|Not Supported| |ETC|Supported|Supported| |EOS|Supported|Supported| |SAND|Supported|Not Supported| |AAVE|Supported|Supported| |THETA|Supported|Supported| |RNDR|Supported|Not Supported| |KCS|Supported|Not Supported| |CFX|Supported|Not Supported| |BIT|Supported|Not Supported| |KLAY|Supported|Not Supported| |CHZ|Supported|Not Supported| |INJ|Supported|Not Supported| |MKR|Supported|Supported| |HT|Supported|Supported| |DASH|Supported|Not Supported| |XDC|Supported|Not Supported| |cETH|Supported|Not Supported| |PAXG|Not Supported|Supported| |PEPE|Supported|Not Supported| |FLR|Supported|Not Supported| |LRC|Supported|Not Supported| |DYDX|Supported|Not Supported| |ENJ|Supported|Supported| |BAT|Supported|Supported| |NEXO|Supported|Not Supported| |KAVA|Supported|Not Supported| |ZEC|Supported|Supported| |cUSDC|Supported|Not Supported| |FET|Supported|Not Supported| |OKT|Supported|Not Supported| |XEM|Supported|Supported| |DFI|Supported|Not Supported| |JASMY|Supported|Not Supported| |CELO|Supported|Supported| |TFUEL|Supported|Not Supported| |AUDIO|Supported|Not Supported| |QTUM|Supported|Not Supported| |YFI|Supported|Not Supported| |GALA|Supported|Not Supported| |COMP|Supported|Not Supported| |RVN|Supported|Not Supported| |BTG|Supported|Supported| |ASTR|Supported|Not Supported| |ANKR|Supported|Not Supported| |GNO|Supported|Not Supported| |DCR|Supported|Not Supported| |WEMIX|Supported|Not Supported| |BAL|Supported|Not Supported| |ONE|Supported|Not Supported| |MAGIC|Supported|Not Supported| |IOTX|Supported|Not Supported| |ZRX|Supported|Not Supported| |GLMR|Supported|Not Supported| |EURT|Supported|Not Supported| |SUSHI|Supported|Not Supported| |IOST|Supported|Not Supported| |AMP|Supported|Not Supported| |RSR|Supported|Not Supported| |POLY|Supported|Not Supported| |GNS|Supported|Not Supported| |CHSB|Supported|Not Supported| |BRISE|Supported|Not Supported| |OCEAN|Supported|Not Supported| The reason why I'm not mentioning the touch screen and other things is it doesn't matter at the end.

"Set up a ""crypto will"": How to transfer your coins to your loved ones from the grave","I've posted on this before, but I saw some recent discussion on this topic and figured it might be worth a revisit. Let's make a plan to bestow your precious coins to your loved ones upon your untimely demise! A simple way to do this is by creating a ""dead person's switch"" via Google's Inactive Account Manager. Once enabled, Google will automatically send a custom email to the family/friends of your choosing after a certain period has elapsed since you were last active on your Google account. Not to worry - you won't be putting your private keys in this email. Google will also attempt to contact you a month before this actually happens, in order to prevent mistakes! --- # How to create a dead-person's switch for your crypto holdings: 1. Go to Google's [Inactive Account Manager](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive) 2. Set a waiting period of something ridiculous, like 6 or 12 or even 18 months (good for forcing the HODL from the grave!) since you were last active. 3. Craft a nerdy email to your loved ones with important info on how to access your stash. DON'T put your actual private keys or website passwords here, as this will be stored on a Google server somewhere. Just put instructions on how to access your PHYSICAL belongings like your laptop, phone, hardware wallet, safe deposit box, etc. Then direct them to a password-protected file stored LOCALLY on your computer / USB drive containing the rest of the instructions on how to access your crypto. For password protection, you can use something free and open-source like 7-Zip to turn any file or folder into an encrypted archive. 4. Remember to tell your family you love them and apologize cheekily for accumulating DOGE at $0.05 despite them telling you to get a job. Maybe even give them some of your degen yield-farming tips! Sit back, relax, and enjoy providing generational ramen wealth for your family from the grave! I realize that this solution isn't perfect (ie, a Google employee could travel to your house and steal your laptop), but I feel that for some, there may be a high barrier to entry to getting a lawyer, drafting a will, or otherwise paying an estate planning agency for their services. The intention of this post is to illuminate an easily-accessible tool from which you can easily craft your own custom solution! Thoughts welcome. Comments: Even if you don't have much, this method is free and will take you just a few minutes to set up!",75,107,2023-05-23 17:33:57,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE,"[('problem use cardano heard ghostchain',

"3 years into crypto, what's changed and what's your perspective?","Just curious about other redditors, what's changed in their opinion, what got better, what got worse, what they think about the future of our beloved tokens and currencies. I joined this sub two years ago to stay up to date with the late new in crypto world and soon discovered that there's just too much to keep up! I'm not much of a spender, I'd rather say I'm poor, I'm one hell of a shrimp and in a couple of years managed to buy just fractions of a Bitcoin and a little more than one whole ETH, that was my goal since the beginning, one ETH. Then played around with altcoins but in the end is just a wasting of time imho as the, solid ones are the blue chips of crypto. Tried holding DOT, ADa, Algo, Near (The new Solana...meh.) Solana itself, sold just before the 200$pump, and a bunch od Doge. All at some point everything got converted in Eth or BTC., since I'm too lazy to trade and hodling fits better my personality! :D In the meanwhile the space here got really exciting, more news that you can't read, lots of shitposting but still interesting insights almost every day, 6.4 million members when it seems the other day we celebrated reaching 3m. This thing went big quick,now we got banners, for fuck's sake! Advertisers dig this sub! Moons started to become a thing and didn't realize it until i've seen I got a thousand, just for chatting on a form about my beloved cryptos., I couldn't believe they were worth something. Some exchanges went down too, condolences to all fellow redditors hurted by that, it sucks, but imho it's a necessary evil to make crypto environment healthier and stronger. I don't see mainstream adoption anytime soon, I think it will be a slow process, but still inexorable in a matter of five or ten years. How your last three years went?

Forbes put Tether in their top 10 crypto investments for May. Lazy journalism or lack of knowledge?,"Hi everyone, Yesterday Forbes made an article about the top 10 crypto investments for May. First of all this is a bit late since we're almost in June. Secondly I saw Tether in it. Since Tether is a stablecoin it's very strange to put it in a top 10 crypto investment list. Their top 10 crypto investments for May are: 1. BTC 2. ETH 3. USDT 4. BNB 5. XRP 6. ADA 7. SOL 8. DOT 9. LTC 10. AVAX What they wrote about Tether exactly: [USDT explanation in https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/in\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/top-10-cryptocurrencies\/](https://preview.redd.it/wipjiazed82b1.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c879b351c28f37ae148f965651714c19bafed0c) They write about Tether being a stablecoin, but they still think it's a good crypto investment for May. Now they say that Tether is favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins, but that's crypto in general right? The only argument I can think of is that people that live in countries with hyperinflation 'invest' in USDT to not lose value over their money, but that's also possible if you just convert to US dollars. In my opinion it's very lazy journalism. Because they almost copy past the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and put it in the article just to have one. The current top 10 in market cap: https://preview.redd.it/8z5o98d3f82b1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5fc768cf32fa6857ec7e3800968c877e5bee99 https://preview.redd.it/27dhlt9kf82b1.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0168221e03c7cd80a1d778e9ddfbc570c67cb4d As you can see they only left out USDC, DOGE and MATIC from the current top 10. And they replaced it by DOT (rank 13), LTC (rank 12) and AVAX (rank 17). What do you guys think? Is this some lazy journalism or lack of knowledge? Thanks for reading!

Exactly 2 years ago Elon said he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price has gone down over 79%,"He first started trying to slowly bring it up to his Twitter followers on April 2, 2019. Probably he schemed an idea to buy shitload of Doge and then try to bring it back to mainstream to his cult fanboys and make shitload of money that way if price increases incredibly because of it. He made four tweets that day regarding to Doge. Here is screenshot of first three. Fourth was just linking an article about Dogecoin. https://preview.redd.it/47y5h7s8m82b1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a470955dc93fc331bd3c95d51294e751fe4d149 Then I guess he forgot about it or postponed his idea, and only started to advertise it pretty heavily like 1.5 years later, price has gone immensely up and it all culminated in anticipation of his SNL appearance. And on May 25 of 2021, exactly 2 years ago he even he even seriously stated that he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price of Doge has gone down over 79.6%, and that wasn't even the lowest price that many people bought the Doge for who trusted Elon for some reason.

"What single word, if spoken, instantly marks a person as someone who does not understand crypto at all","So many common people don't understand crypto. Sometimes overhearing conversation from these people can be very entertaining. They have no clue about crypto and sometimes it feels like they make up nonsense assumptions just to have a discussion. So this time, I've overheard while traveling on train, an older couple talking about ""doggy"" coin. Those ""doggy"" coins are gold coins which have a dog face printed on it and those young people on the internet order them...this is what the old couple talk about. This conversation finishes with a statement that this ""doggy"" coin is used for shady business. They weren't talking about some new memecoin, they were refering to DOGE coin, but they clearly dunno what it is. For me ""doggy"" was the keyword which marks those 2 as complete clueless crypto haters.",87,543,2023-05-27 15:54:03,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('bitcoin cash', 3), ('lambo', 1), ('doge andor moon',

The Evolution of DOGE Pronunciation,"DOGE got its start in 2013 and there has been conversation since on how to pronounce it. Slate ran a poll in 2014 on how to pronounce DOGE https://preview.redd.it/jbpsuc85gh2b1.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=be35f326e117bf8bc38714980277e63c124bb2f0 It was split about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 for dohj, dohg, and two-syllable close to dog-ee. A Reddit poll in 2015 showed some change in the perceived pronunciation https://preview.redd.it/v9n5aibkgh2b1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=86dd32d43ba0ac9da577a936d1336bc74730578a Dohj took the lead with 43%, then dohg with 38%, and 11% with two-syllable close to dog-ee. It was clear that dog-ee was falling out of favor fast. Fast forward to 2023 and it is known that it is pronounced dohj. There is no debate anymore. Jackson Palmer, one of the founders, put out a YouTube video with the ""correct"" pronunciation.

I really hope we have learned from our mistakes from the past bull run by now and won't be using sites such as Robinhood anymore.,"Everyday you live through right now is just one day closer to the next bull market, whenever that may come. But we have a lot of things to do before that happens anyway, that is mostly reflecting on our previous bull market to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes again. If we waited for two years now for a bull market, but just make the same stupid mistakes, it was all for nothing basically. Reflecting and improving upon your prior mistakes is probably one of the most important actions to take, especially here in Crypto, so let's have a look at some of the big ones (from my personal experience): 1. Not selling, yeah just holding onto your coins is not always good especially if you invested in a project just for the profits, then you should also have the courage to take those profits. 2. FOMOing, by now we should know that by the time everyone here is talking about something you already missed the train with the big profits and will now just become some exit liquidity. 3. Using the right platforms. Yeah this one may be one of the most important, especially even after 2022. You have to choose the sites carefully where you store your Crypto and where you also trade some. The grand example for that may be Robinhood. Yeah, in 2021 Robinhood was all the hype and everyone wanted their Crypto Wallets on it and the listings of Cryptos like DOGE on there was heavily anticipated. Many were just too late to see how they were manipulating the prices themselves. Hopefully we will stay true to our words and be stronger, wilder, faster and most importantly smarter during our next bull market.",61,109,2023-05-28 21:13:12,CryptoCurrency,REMINDER,"[('robinhood

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 3. Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 6. Meme Coins - (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap). 8. Liquid Staking Tokens (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap). This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

"PEPE site homepage has a frog, pants down butt out and pissing on memecoin logos. PEPE pumps and dumps multiple times everyday. The same PEPE that is by far one of the most well-known and easily in top 100 most valuable tokens by market cap. This is embarrassing for the ""future of finance"" in crypto","PEPE is by far one off the most popular tokens. It was ranked in the top 50 tokens after hitting very nearly a 2 Billion market cap. Even today it still sits in the top 100 after losing over a Billion of market cap. It saw insane price increase of 1000% in a week, even before the Binance listing which again doubled the price. If you ask someone to randomly name a few crypto tokens, PEPE will probably be in that list. There's definitely very few in crypto who haven't heard of PEPE. Yet, we don't have to dig very deeply to be disappointed. The pepe website homepage is pretty barebones and poorly done, probably by design, but the worst part is definitely this. https://preview.redd.it/eeoo5lnbvz2b1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=676377ef278be921d54f0afcdf90c40cba3e665b One of the most premier tokens has this as an advertising banner. I saw a document that claimed to be the whitepaper use a lot of material of this homepage in it, but it's unclear if there actually is an official whitepaper at all. Regardless of an official whitepaper or just the official website, this is pretty bad. Of course the whole roadmap and pitch with Phase 1 MEME etc is pretty poor as well. The about section ironically call out the ridiculousness of modern memecoins(or mostly sh\*tcoins realistically) but also just buys right back into it for self-shilling. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/2l7h9ggdwz2b1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=b098caa7916df9268f563631bce3870db3bedb71 I mean, yeah, we get that it's a memecoin.

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he's lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. However, there's more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it's a little easier to make profits in crypto. He's undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it's still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world's largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it's also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he's unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each. While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling! Edit to add: I should've titled this ""but only in there money he's lost"". I hope it's clear from this post that I think he's a huge manipulator and a problem for our crypto space.

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin, and Chainlink. Below is the latest update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment. tl;dr: What's this all about? Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and again in 2023 because I'm a glutton for punishment (and to show different entry points). Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether) [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/). APRIL HIGHLIGHTS: mostly flat with about half of the cryptos single digits in the red this month. Overall, BNB well in first place +767%. ETH distant second place +150%, ADA in 3rd place +116%. 2021 Portfolio +95% vs S&P's +11% 2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +109% compared to +26% in the S&P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments. ## Month Twenty-Eight - UP 95% https://preview.redd.it/3ppwgpjsmm3b1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=506cc1c19a4457c8fdbbe717299d6f644dc2ef90 The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB, and LINK. April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: Mixed, but mostly red month for the 2021 Portfolio BNB continues to maintain a strong overall lead, BTC approaching break even point 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +95% in twenty-eight months ## April Ranking and Dropout Report https://preview.redd.it/a2jheaftmm3b1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=5537f4c262b6f4f365a94eea2d8ec785ddce3b01 Top Ten dropouts since January 2021: twenty-eight months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, four cryptos have dropped out: Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash. They have been replaced by MATIC, SOL, DOGE, and USDC. ## April Winners and Losers April Winners - BNB was the clear winner this month, up +6%. April Losers - XRP turned in the worst performance in April (-9%). ## Overall Update - BNB dominates, 50% of cryptos in green, BTC approaching break even point, BCH worst performing As has been the case for much of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, BNB remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far. It is up +767%, the $100 investment into BNB twenty-eight months ago is now worth $869. ETH is in distant second place, up +150%, the $100 now worth $251. At the bottom, BCH is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down -66% since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). ## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector: https://preview.redd.it/2lhsm7oumm3b1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14343b16982ac037e82f0c1847f1b1886582a52 As a sector, crypto is up +51% since January 2021. You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has produced better returns than the overall crypto market cap (+95% vs. +51%) over the twenty-eight month life of the 2021 Portfolio. This is a bit of an outlier: the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind over their respective market caps in their respective time frames. Here are the latest figures: 2018 Top Ten Portfolio: -36% for the Top Ten vs. +104% for the total market cap 2019 Top Ten Portfolio: +227% for the Top Ten vs. +822% for the total market cap 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: +399% for the Top Ten vs. +518% for the total market cap 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: +95% for the Top Ten vs. +51% for the total market cap 2022 Top Ten Portfolio: -69% for the Top Ten vs. -47% for the total market cap 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: +36% for the Top Ten vs. 47% for the total market cap Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments. Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [$775B in January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [$2.6T in October 2021.](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10) ## Bitcoin Dominance: https://preview.redd.it/tyfk454wmm3b1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=0322fb732fd9fe15948206ed2020d91012a11473 BitDom has bounced a bit in recent months, now sitting at 46.8%. ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021: https://preview.redd.it/1q234uwxmm3b1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=8026e6386849a7e196b4190bfd68a1b590d7baaf Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +95%. The initial $1000 investment twenty-eight months ago, on New Year's Day, 2021, is worth $1,955. Here's the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective as we go along: https://preview.redd.it/79la6oxymm3b1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c1edd0c276521170b5b53cdb6fb5bcebf8b717 Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios As most readers are aware, this is the sixth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/). Where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -36% (total value $639) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +227% (total value $3,267) [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +399% (total value $4,989) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +95% (total value $1,955) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -69% (total value $311) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +36% (total value $1,362) So overall? Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $12,523. That's up +109% on the combined portfolios. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021's all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%. To visualize the progress of the combined portfolios: https://preview.redd.it/m79tgcn0nm3b1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee385c634040a88e19209d8d644c77d182e217e In summary: That's a +109% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/dye0ido1nm3b1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39e30912fa0772def86c1a95b9c9463ef609fdb The S&P 500 Index is up +11% since January 1st, 2021. The initial $1k investment I put into crypto twenty-eight months ago would be worth $1,110 had it been redirected to the S&P 500. The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up +95% over the same time period - the initial $1k investment in crypto twenty-eight months ago is now worth $1,955. That's a difference of $845 on a $1k investment in twenty-eight months. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first six years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world's slowest dollar cost averaging method? Here are the figures: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,560 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,660 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,290 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,110 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,090 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,580. That is up +26% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +109% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. To help provide perspective, here's a chart showing the combined six year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point: https://preview.redd.it/2vqbeho2nm3b1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f73f5b0d77539ca8359d5eeaa2a8f5e87cdf1f ## Conclusion: To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

I decided to compare it with the leading tech companies and the king and queen of cryptocurrencies. In addition, I also added a line with 1/10th of BTC's total value because my astrological prevision says that, at maximum, if people are \~stupid\~ crazy enough, DOGE could value max 1/10th of BTC market. And this is what I got (y axis is in log scale). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/kv9swkzwvd4b1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=67c5a8199deed9034592a91b7edbdf42752a88a5 The vertical dashed lines are: 1/10\_BTC equals DOGE at price 0.3600 NFLX equals DOGE at price 1.2850 ETH-USD equals DOGE at price 1.5700 BTC-USD equals DOGE at price 3.5850 TSLA equals DOGE at price 4.9400 META equals DOGE at price 4.9850 NVDA equals DOGE at price 6.9300 AMZN equals DOGE at price 9.2100 At $0.36 USD, it would be equivalent to 1/10th of BTC. Any other price, such as 'DOGE to $1 rocket emoji', seems highly improbable, as at $1 USD, it would be nearing the value of Netflix. However, my question is, are there any arbitrarily large groups of people willing to invest a total of $40 billion or even $170 billion?

46% of the Top 15 Tokens now Defined as Securities by SEC,"When removing all stable coins but BUSD, since that was named by the SEC, 46% of the top 15 tokens by market cap have been labelled a security. Here are the notable exceptions: BTC -> Obvious as SEC has said explicitly its a commodity ETH -> SEC has not said it directly but has avoided labelling ETH a security when pushed even by congress. STETH -> Likely will be lumped in with ETH DOGE -> Not sure why DOGE has avoided this other than its creators created it as a joke and abandoned it until recently and reinvigorating the ""non-profit"" DOGE foundation. Also, ironically, explicitly being labelled as a joke by the creators kinda blows the Howey test out of the water since there was no expectation of profit, it was explicitly communicated to not invest in this, and it was only the haphazard community which initially formed around it that kept it going. So the ironic unintended consequence of being a joke in a weird way might have made it into a commodity rather than a security. DOGE is an interesting one. I don't own any cause I still think it's a crap coin and I'd rather have BTC. But still ... interesting. LTC -> Another interesting one. Again, doesn't have a very centralised presence. Just the non-profit foundation. This could be seen as centralised enough since the foundation could be considered the ""governing body"" which directs development and thus the 4 elements of the Howey Test might apply. DOT -> Probably the most interesting since, of all the projects, DOT has come out and explicitly and publicly declared it is no longer a Security and has morphed into distributed software and the DOT token is a commodity used to interact with the software. DOT is fully decentralised with a unique distributed governing structure or DAO. While Parity is the primary developer it cannot unilaterally update the chain and all updates must go through DOT's decentralised governance; moreover, anyone can put forward chain updates to be voted on so even the development itself is decentralised. One would think, of all the tokens, the SEC would want to take on DOT due to its explicit declaration in Nov. 2022 that it is NOT a security and in a way the Web3 Foundation thumbing their nose at the SEC .... unless it agrees with the Web3 Foundation ... 🧐 ... or at the very least SECs capitulation that you can't litigate an organisation which has no control over the product ... hmmmmm ... sounds like a commodity. AVAX -> I'm going 50/50 on this one. Its development is fairly centralised and there is a lack of clear decentralised government, but, so far, it's a notable outlier and has some interesting characteristics ... but ... does it be a the Howey Test? SHIB -> Super centralised project. Total security. SEC probably doesn't even care about it because it's such a joke of a project.",63,126,2023-06-07 06:21:43,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('someone say moon cant wait dogecoin reach stars', 3), ('wheres

"The bear market is doing an adequate job cleansing the crypto space of bad projects and actors. Although it is a painful experience now, this cleansing is great for crypto's future","During the bull market, people often proclaimed that the bear market will cleanse the crypto space. Now that we are deep in bear territory, a popular opinion here is that the bear market did not do its job of cleansing this space. For instance, there was a post on this a little over a month ago when shitcoins were popping off https://preview.redd.it/1vtnvi07715b1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=4424647fdedfa4694e01eaa17430bff61808168f It is true that we have not gotten rid of all the shitty projects. However, I would argue that the bear market HAS cleansed this space of a lot of garbage. # A lot of the bad projects are down a ton HEX dropped 99% FTT dropped 99% Luna dropped 100% Algo dropped 96% \[yes, I count this one. It had 500%+ inflation in 2021. Sorry.\] Shib dropped 92% Doge dropped 93% A lot of the NFTs (like pictures of rocks or monkeys) are now $0 All the other shitcoins that popped off earlier this year are also down a lot. PEPE dropped 79% from the high, for instance. # A ton of bad actors have been removed from this space FTX is gone, taking a lot of bad actors with it, such as SBF and Caroline Ellison Do Kwon is gone The Celsius ponzi scheme died and with it Alex Mashinsky lost a lot of influence The Three Arrows Capital ponzi scheme died * A lot of small exchanges died that mishandled user funds &#x200B; Is there still too much money shinvested in bad projects? Yep. Was the process of cleansing this space painful? For sure. RIP our portfolios. Is this good for the space on the long term? If you ask me, absolutely. There were too many bad actors, and a lot of them got flushed out. Now it is time to build and innovate and be patient.

Gensler sues American Kennel Club for promoting dogs,"Gary Gensler at the SEC announced today a new lawsuit against the American Kennel Club (AKC). The suit alleges that the Kennel Club played the major role in promoting and breeding Shiba Inu's and other dogs, from which a large number of crypto tokens - unregistered securities - have been inspired and developed. These have included Dogecoin, Baby Doge, BONK, Nano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Safe Inu, 'and a bunch of other shitcoins.' Gensler was quoted as saying, ""their dogs may be cute, but the Kennel Club needs to come in, sit down with us and register their organization if they want to keep breeding and showing canines, particularly the Inu varieties, as they've been the main reason that the evil of crypto meme coins even exists."" ""These coins and tokens have bred out of control, much like the mongrels that the American Kennel Club loves so much. They need to start taking responsibility for misleading the American public by pretending that they don't have a role in this."" In response, a confused AKC had immediately delisted Shiba Inu breed from its list of recognized dogs, and announced that they would be moving their headquarters to the United Arab Emirates.",1,0,2023-06-10 16:08:17,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY,"[('bearish security dogs rough days ahead ks', 9), ('nobody stop madman gary gensler', 3), ('know comedy post gensler lost every credibility moment knew applied binance advisor board', 2), ('whole industry going shake ks deemed unregistered security dogs likely subject us sanctions', 3), ('good bitcoin', 1), ('gensler sues aubreys wig store due confusion real faux fur claims connections outside wig production feeding leads labor regulated within us guidelines aubreys wig store made colorful accusations towards investigators genitals violent confrontation wig counter suing damages done two acrylic nails', 2), ('almost believed', 4), ('followed wig industry rug industry hit nation wide sec suit folds leaving consumers choice install vinyl planks manage combover', 2), ('yes good', 1), ('everything danger', 2), ('malinois left chat', 7), ('gensler definitely gon na invade poland', 4), ('go buy x leverage akc', 1), ('dam shitzu every time bite ankles loud fuck', 1), ('fact blockchain teacher shilled algorand disqualified long ago', 2), ('cryptskrieg attack', 2), ('need sell mine fast go cats', 2), ('gary dog loves barking wagging tail white collars', 2), ('gary gensler nobody knows next', 1), ('gary gitler', 2), ('way biased', 1), ('gensler type guy sue nose finding unregistered booger claim whatever fuck wants courts decide', 2), ('throws frisbee malinois comes flying back chat', 7), ('accurate', 5), ('scientific fact malinois never let frisbee touch ground', 6), ('medals give literally dog tokens gallows', 2), ('rule suitable titles flairs rule titles satire comedy posts must begin tag satire see expanded rules page details rule sub rules expanded rules site rules', 1)]",gensler sues american kennel club promoting dogs gary gensler sec announced today new lawsuit american kennel club akc suit alleges kennel club played major role promoting breeding shiba inus dogs large number crypto tokens unregistered securities inspired developed included dogecoin baby doge bonk nano dogecoin shiba inu safe inu bunch shitcoins gensler quoted saying dogs may cute kennel club needs come sit us register organization want keep breeding showing canines particularly inu varieties theyve main reason evil crypto meme coins even exists coins tokens bred control much like mongrels american kennel club loves much need start taking responsibility misleading american public pretending dont role response confused akc immediately delisted shiba inu breed list recognized dogs announced would moving headquarters united arab emirates

With all of those news development there is one thing Crypto has not been over the past days and that is, boring.

"Since SEC is suing everybody, which Cryptocurrencies or assets consider to be not a security?","There are uncertainly in the Crypto Markets because SEC has considered many cryptos as securities and suing popular exchanges like Coinbase and [Binance.US](https://Binance.US). Both definitions of securities and commodities are confusing when applying to Crypto that even SEC has difficulty giving clear guidance. The classification of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets determine how they are regulated. Securities are more heavily regulated and tax more than commodities. If the cryptocurrency is a security, then the issuer and exchanges must seek licenses from regulators which is difficult to do. That is why there is a hard push toward decentralization to avoid security laws. That way a security regulator cannot identify a central, coordinated group responsible for driving the value of the token. Another reason for cryptocurrencies to be classified as securities will have a risk of not being listed on exchanges to avoid fines by SEC. ### What is not a security? Currency A check (whether or not certified), draft, bill of exchange, or bank letter of credit A note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in a mercantile or consumer, rather than an investment, transaction An interest in a deposit account with a bank or a savings and loan association An insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract under which an insurance company promises to pay money either in a lump sum or periodically for life or for some other specified period ### Common characteristics of unregistered securities: They are represented as safe investments. They are represented as no risk investments. They are represented as guaranteed return investments. They offer returns on investment that are greater than the prevailing market. The sales commissions paid to sales agents are much higher than for traditional products. [https://www.tn.gov/commerce/securities/investors/what-is-a-security.html](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/securities/investors/what-is-a-security.html) So which Cryptocurrencies are considered not a security but a commodity? According to court filings by CFCT on Dec 13, 2022 in New York. CFCT vs SAMUEL BANKMAN-FRIED, FTX TRADING listed below on page 6. \>21.

Which Cryptocurrencies or assets are considered to be not a Security?,"There are uncertainly in the Crypto Markets because SEC has considered many cryptos as securities and suing popular exchanges like Coinbase and [Binance.US](https://Binance.US). Both definitions of securities and commodities are confusing when applying to Crypto that even SEC has difficulty giving clear guidance. The classification of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets determine how they are regulated. Securities are more heavily regulated and tax more than commodities. If the cryptocurrency is a security, then the issuer and exchanges must seek licenses from regulators which is difficult to do. That is why there is a hard push toward decentralization to avoid security laws. That way a security regulator cannot identify a central, coordinated group responsible for driving the value of the token. Another reason for cryptocurrencies to be classified as securities will have a risk of not being listed on exchanges to avoid fines by SEC. ### What is not a security? Currency A check (whether or not certified), draft, bill of exchange, or bank letter of credit A note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in a mercantile or consumer, rather than an investment, transaction An interest in a deposit account with a bank or a savings and loan association An insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract under which an insurance company promises to pay money either in a lump sum or periodically for life or for some other specified period ### Common characteristics of unregistered securities: They are represented as safe investments. They are represented as no risk investments. They are represented as guaranteed return investments. They offer returns on investment that are greater than the prevailing market. The sales commissions paid to sales agents are much higher than for traditional products. [https://www.tn.gov/commerce/securities/investors/what-is-a-security.html](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/securities/investors/what-is-a-security.html) So which Cryptocurrencies are considered not a security but a commodity?

This sums up the UI experience using cdc in the last 4 years.,"Curious as to what lol things other people see on a daily basis. By far using kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, cashapp, to buy and move crypto. By far and away the most horrible customer service, UI, prices, prices on the buy and sell side. &#x200B; example : if you are buying anything but CRO using cdc, they charge an absurd fee + you paying wayyyyyy above \true price\. The single and only reason I have ever used CDC at all is for Cro. Absolutely one of the most sus places to place a buy order in a bull run is [crypto.co](https://crypto.com)m. surprisingly the ui is absolutely unchanged from me calling out their third world programming, they call derivative, up down options. Jesus Christ please come back and bathe the world in fire that is so fucking stupid. But I digress. Kinda excited about this little dip on the market. Just thought I would ask what funny, stupid, or actually concerning issues to you see as it relates to the platforms you use. &#x200B; for example on cdc. You need about 100k in equity in the USA to be using the exchange. If you are not using the exchange you had better be up 40% from your initial purchase. Minimum. 40% they shill the fuckkkkkkk out of the buy and sell side on every single thing on that pos app. I used to love making the example of what 1 eth would cost you on kraken, Coinbase, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com), Gemini. by far and away. The absolute worst place. The most Becky place as I call it for anyone to buy eth, btc, xlm, anything. Was always cdc. Kraken has beat prices from my experience. Preferred platform by far.

Does all this commotion get you excited for crypto even more? I'm more excited and nervous than ever. Feels like it's either the bottom or the top from here ... ready to strap in!,"A bit if background: I got into crypto with the doge boost a few years backand hold a meager amount compared to many of you here. I have followed the ecosystem relatively closely, tried to keep up with (slightly) understanding tech, keeping away from scams, watching the market etc etc. - all to a slight degree - at least trying to keep abreast of topics enough to have more nuanced convos about the crypto world. Anyways - from my cursory knowledge, it feels like this could be a make or break moment truly. I know it has been said before, but in the past it was with one coin, or one exchange, but right now it's all sort of blowing up - it's hard not to see it as the dominos falling. But with all that - i can't help but think of the old adage ""all news is good news"" and how if crypto can withstand this - and can show WHY it's still worth while - it could usher in a whole new era of crypto users. I guess if I had a question it would be: what do you think could be the best outcome possible for cryptocurrency more generally, given all the heavy handed negative sentiment lately?

Сrypto contest,"Hello everyone! I apologize in advance for any errors and inappropriate language as the text was translated using a translator. I am conducting a contest among crypto communities. The contest involves solving a task that consists of three parts. The first 10 people to solve it will share the prize among themselves. The task will be posted on June 26, 2023. To participate in the contest, you will need to transfer any amount to any of the crypto wallet addresses listed below (only transfer from the addresses that you are willing to receive rewards in case you win). The prize will consist of the collected funds. Contest Plan: 1) Announce the contest on various platforms. 2) In case of interest, conduct a survey on which messengers would be more convenient to publish polls and information about the contest. 3) Conduct a survey on whether the task will be posted in the 0 time zone or will be adjusted to different time zones. 4) Post the task. 5) Publish a report on the transferred funds to the winners. 6) Conduct a small survey among the winners, and with their consent, post the survey results in groups. To be honest, I am interested in knowing which regions the winners will be from and how they will manage their funds. I will also receive a portion of the funds (the prize will be divided into 11 parts, 10 parts will be rounded up for the contest winners, and the remainder will be left with me. I plan to spend a portion of the remainder on charity and a portion on additional education and subsequent project implementation). I will check messages periodically and respond to comments.

Why can't we just succeed slightly?,"As the title reads - Why can't the people that put in their hard earned money, get at least something back from Crypto/coin investments? Is it really too much to ask for? Over the years, I've come to realise that crypto investments are genuinlely just not for anyone with any money. I've invested a fair share over the past few years, but I've gained nothing, actually lost money. If I leave my money, why can't it just grow? Give me fucking 1% per month if anything. The volatility is actually just pure socialist bullshit. I feel foolish that I took this whole crypto thing with any slight possible seriousness at all. I'm 100% certain that this has to be the general consensus. There are literally millions of posts in the same realm. Take these last few days, let's take Solana, for example. Now a lot of people bash Solana for ""downtime"". Okay? Cool. But then the SEC makes some random decision to label it a security. Again, okay? Why? Does it even fucking matter? Why is the okay? Why does every little thing affect crypto. The wind blows - Eth goes down. Elon shits his pants on twitter about Doge = cataclysmic investment failure. Someone says some random shit about Crypto = fluctuation. Whales = OWN THE MARKET. Fuck off if you disagree, you're an idiot. Etc. Etc. Why are we even doing this? Cause we wanna make some extra money I guess, or we believe in a world with true monetary decentralisation. The latter sounds cool, but will cost you all your money it seems. Rant the fuck over.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post. So to sum it up: \- Monthly deposit to exchanges; \- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap; \- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip; \- Stake holdings on exchange; \- Investment horizon 5 years; \- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame. \- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed. \- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :) Found out the hard way that one thing is very important....

Top Crypto Subreddits by Size,"Below is a table of the largest crypto subreddits by size. This is a gauge of how much these coins/tokens and crypto related items have a community on Reddit. However, this is probably not a good indicator of active community as some of these subreddits are much older with people joining over time and then not interacting with the sub any more. There are a few large subreddits that are related to a single coin such as ethereum/shib. I have tried to find all the major crypto subreddits but I am sure I missed a few. I have also included some that are general and not specific to a coin such as this very sub. Some subs were shown as the same number of subscribers so I shared the same rank (eg, the btc and BitcoinBeginners sub both had 1.1 million). I could not obtain some subreddit sizes as the subs have become private such as: /r/Stellar /r/blockchain &#x200B; |Subreddit|Rank by Size|Community Size| |:-|:-|:-| |/r/CryptoCurrency|1|6.5 million|

I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for almost 5.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/). MAY Highlights: \- XRP easily wins the month, followed by Litecoin. Bitcoin is in the lead so far in 2023, followed by XRP and ETH in second place. The 2023 portfolio is +32% so far this year. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period (see below for details). New feature: for the first time this year, my Top Ten edges total market cap token AMKT out for a monthly victory, but overall is still leading +56% vs. the Top Ten's +32% in 2023 in this year's friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). ## Month Five - Up +32% https://preview.redd.it/9h2kr3h6z66b1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=8952cd32ad73bd0e3f1821c648b5debbe5205092 The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC. May highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: For the second month in a row, the 2023 Top Ten drops modestly - but back to back losses are enough to land the Portfolio back to January levels of ROI. XRP easily outperformed the field in May (+9%), followed by Litecoin. The rest either maintained or lost ground. Bitcoin holds on to the lead so far in 2023, followed by XRP and ETH in second place. ## May Ranking and Dropouts Here's a look at the movement in the ranks five months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment: https://preview.redd.it/1gzrx6o8z66b1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=afce2767b080e05383e8183d8c1335a8c4c5c3d0 Remarkably steady so far during the five months of 2023, with only BUSD dropping out of the original portfolio, replaced by SOL. ## May Winner and Loser May Winner - XRP easily outperformed its peers, up +9% in May. May Loser - DOT, down -10%, was the worst performing crypto of the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio this month. ## Overall Update: BTC maintains lead, XRP and ETH move into second place, all crypto still in the green for the year, barely. Every crypto in this year's Experiment is still in positive territory, although DOGE is very close to being the first in the Top Ten Portfolio to get back down to the break even point. It is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance so far, barely in the green at +2% for the year. For the second month in a rown, BTC holds on to the top spot after overtaking MATIC for the lead [two months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3). The initial $100 invested in BTC five months ago is worth $162 today. XRP and ETH are next, +55% since New Year's Day. ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023: https://preview.redd.it/ubw14u5az66b1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=532a5c8c9a06e66b7d36653a498fb5ca10f2fb82 The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio lost $45 in May. The initial $1000 investment on New Year's Day 2023 is now worth $1,317. At +32%, the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio is at its lowest month end ROI of the year. Here's a visual summary of the progress so far: https://preview.redd.it/tc2zfubbz66b1.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=06c44d7b06531581d51b09fbd9bc39b972e59e41 ## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT). New feature this year - The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market. Much has changed in the last 5+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)). This year's friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (AMKT). AMKT is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index. Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market - exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start. Here's the question I'm tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund? On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT. Five months into the Experiment, here's the AMKT snapshot: https://preview.redd.it/bwcd1oqcz66b1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9f19fbdfad9c23f7ac701d08d0a805869556b0 May Performances: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: -3% AMKT: -4% For the first time in 2023, the monthly victory goes to: The Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolio. Overall since January 1st, 2023: The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio: current value $1,317 (+32%) AMKT: current value $1,560 (+56%) Overall lead: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT) For the more visual, here's the table I'll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. AMKT competition this year: https://preview.redd.it/cgzck9zdz66b1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=4872087c7cf14820cfd72249bb5704fca3e8d5fa # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios The 2023 Top Ten is one of six concurrent experimental portfolios. Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -37% (total value $628) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +229% (total value $3,286) [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +379% (total value $4,788) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +87% (total value $1,870) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -70% (total value $299) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +32% (total value $1,317) Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $12,188. That's up +103% on the combined portfolios. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021's all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%. Here's the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals: https://preview.redd.it/kkqnie8fz66b1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=657679410e8a6a85b6734763e6cb3c96aa9d8ee7 In summary: That's a +103% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/19hyvuggz66b1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb66d67ec530dde7afad7db50de03e75526a6074 The S&P 500 is up +10% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year's Day would be worth $1,100 had it been redirected to the S&P. Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I've been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,580 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,680 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,310 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,120 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $890 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,100 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,680. That is up +28% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +103% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: https://preview.redd.it/6w8jj1phz66b1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=cec4ea8f5aae82f047aedae34e29f3f249b72c31 ## Conclusion: To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. A reporting note: I'll focus on 2023 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.

"TuzkiEth, new meme token, with the potential to rival Doge and Shiba","Hello Reddit and Crypto Meme Lovers. Get ready for a crazy twist in the Tuzki universe! You all know Tuzki, that adorable bunny meme that makes us laugh, right? Well, here's the deal: Tuzki now has its very own token called TuzkiEth on the Ethereum blockchain. And guess what? The original creator is completely clueless about it! Can you believe the bunny drama that's about to unfold? 😂 Let me fill you in on the details: While the Tuzki creator was busy spreading joy with their cute bunny, some sneaky crypto enthusiasts decided to create TuzkiEth-a token that's gaining popularity faster than Tuzki munches on carrots! Now, before you start worrying about any legal stuff, let's just assume that the original creator is cool with this unexpected turn of events. I mean, who wouldn't want their meme to have its very own crypto, right? It's like Tuzki is taking over the financial world one hop at a time! But hey, just in case the original creator feels left out or confused, let's show them some love. How about rewarding them with some Tuzki tokens? It's only fair, considering that Tuzki's success wouldn't have been possible without their initial brilliance. So, let's spread the word and suggest this idea to the TuzkiEth creators. Maybe they could send a cool bunny-themed care package with carrots, Tuzki plushies, and a bunch of Tuzki tokens. It's a win-win situation! Imagine this: Tuzki and TuzkiEth teaming up like the ultimate bunny duo. Tuzki continues to make us laugh with its funny expressions, while TuzkiEth takes us on an exciting crypto adventure. We could trade Tuzki-themed NFTs, swap tokens like bunnies hopping around, and who knows, maybe even have a Tuzki-themed decentralized exchange. The possibilities are endless, just like Tuzki's cuteness! Remember, this post is all in good fun. We're here to enjoy the hilarity and embrace the chaos. Let's unite as a community and see where this TuzkiEth journey takes us! Disclaimer: This post is purely for entertainment purposes.

"Just because the project you believe in supposedly has great fundamentals, it doesn't mean it will perform better than that shitcoin you laugh at people for buying.","Just speaking on this community, there is constantly laughs about how people got suckered into buying shitcoins like Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and that they deserve it... And it's coming from same people that got suckered into buying ''big fundamentals'' projects like Algo, LRC, Nano in their, or close to their all time highs. For example the 3 shitcoins I mentioned are down this much from their all time high: 91%, 92%, 79%, where as these 3 projects that were all over this community are down this much from their all time highs: 97%, 95%, 98%. And when these crappy animal coins go down we will have popular threads on here laughing at folks: well they got what they deserve. How could they not have seen it.

Mining in an apartment,"Hello. I have a question about mining. In the event of free electricity in a unit, is mining possible? For example, a miner with lower wattage. I figured that wouldn't be as detectable. Also, it wouldn't put off as much heat. I don't know how to do this yet, but I'd like to run a lower wattage miner and try and figure out how to harness the heat to heat a tropical fish tank. I don't know if this fish tank idea is practical, just an idea. Anyways, would a lower wattage miner raise suspicions? Has anyone been an a rental that allowed free electricity, and you mined? EDIT: What about something like a Goldshell Box? They are 260W and under. Would something like that be alright you think? I'm okay with not mining much, just something I've always wanted to do. EDIT 2: I see a Goldshell Mini-DOGE Pro that uses only 220W. Would 220W watts be reasonable?

Decoding Mining and Masternodes: Different Approaches to Blockchain Rewards,"I've been diving deep into the world of blockchain mining lately and I'm fascinated by the different reward mechanisms used. From PoW to PoS and even variants like DPoS, it's a complex landscape. Mining and Masternodes are two different approaches to rewarding participants in a blockchain network. Let's explore each of them in detail: Mining is the process of validating and adding new transactions to a blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. Miners use powerful computing hardware to compete against each other to find the solution first. The first miner to solve the problem receives the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency coins as a reward for their efforts. This process is known as proof-of-work. Best Cryptos to Mine in 2023 1. Monero (XMR) 2. Litecoin (LTC) 3. Ethereum Classic (ETC) 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) 5. Zcash (ZEC) Masternodes are a type of full node in a blockchain network that perform additional functions beyond transaction validation. They often provide advanced services like instant transactions, privacy features, and decentralized governance. Masternodes require a significant investment in cryptocurrency to operate, as a collateral amount of coins is typically required to participate. Best Masternode Cryptocurrencies in 2023 Dashpay - Ability to empower individuals through swift and confidential transactions. Most SAFU passive income play with an airtight crypto community. Morpheus.Network - Revolutionizing the global supply chain market through blockchain technology, enhancing transparency and efficiency. Newest SAFU node out of the lot with a very high ROI. Vechain - Transforming industries with its blockchain-based solutions for supply chain management. It gives a very low ROI but has a very big community making it extremely SAFU. Horizon - Fostering privacy and security in the digital world, offering a decentralized platform for secure communications and transactions. Good ROI with a low MC, which increases its growth potential. These two systems do not overlap, as no mining takes place on masternode computers nor can a mining computer run a masternode. All of the miners and the masternode owners are members of the blockchain community and their work and support provide the financial strength to the blockchain network. Now which one you want to pick depends on the different range of distribution of rewards both. &#x200B;",1,0,2023-06-17 19:44:30,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1), ('shitposting rcc count mining', 1)]",decoding mining masternodes different approaches blockchain rewards ive diving deep world blockchain mining lately im fascinated different reward mechanisms used pow pos even variants like dpos complex landscape mining masternodes two different approaches rewarding participants blockchain network lets explore detail mining process validating adding new transactions blockchain solving complex mathematical problems miners use powerful computing hardware compete find solution first first miner solve problem receives right add new block transactions blockchain rewarded newly minted cryptocurrency coins reward efforts process known proofofwork best cryptos mine monero xmr litecoin ltc ethereum classic etc dogecoin doge zcash zec masternodes type full node blockchain network perform additional functions beyond transaction validation often provide advanced services like instant transactions privacy features decentralized governance masternodes require significant investment cryptocurrency operate collateral amount coins typically required participate best masternode cryptocurrencies dashpay ability empower individuals swift confidential transactions safu passive income play airtight crypto community morpheusnetwork revolutionizing global supply chain market blockchain technology enhancing transparency efficiency newest safu node lot high roi vechain transforming industries blockchainbased solutions supply chain management gives low roi big community making extremely safu horizon fostering privacy security digital world offering decentralized platform secure communications transactions good roi low mc increases growth potential two systems overlap mining takes place masternode computers mining computer run masternode miners masternode owners members blockchain community work support provide financial strength blockchain network one want pick depends different range distribution rewards xb

Elon Musk should be charged with market manipulation,"This is a popular concept on Reddit but let me provide a reason no one is talking about: Elon Musk promoted doge because he ""likes dogs and memes"" and thinks that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. ""Entertaining"" to who? Was it entertaining to late-but-not-too-late crypto tech investors who didn't profit enough from their legitimate investments to avoid eating ramen in 2022 and 2023? Was it entertaining to the people who built actual technical advancements in cryptocurrency tech and markets that have gone underfunded over the last 3 years? To him, flexing his financial might is the most entertaining outcome, as he cripples crypto tech investors on their journey to financial freedom. How does he do this? Well, as we know, he pumps the sh*t out of the expensive, outdated, slow-to-confirm, hyperinflationary dogcrap coin and pretends that it is somehow better than the projects that actually mean to redesign the global financial system. He is a villain to all crypto tech investors. Let me take you back in time to October 2020. Doge is $0.0025 with a market cap of $350M. Elon had talked about it for a while, here and there, but he begins to really pump the name. Most of his audience doesn't know what a market cap even is but they want to make money and are the FOMO buyers that will lift the crypto market to its eventual all time highs. What he doesn't include in his analysis is the fact that doge requires millions of dollars of capital inflows every week to keep itself afloat. Every single day 14.4M doge enter circulation. Forever. Every day... forever. It literally never stops. At $0.06, with each of those 14.4M entering circulation (which is not necessarily what happens, btw, but it is important to consider), the market needs to offer $850K worth of support. That's each and every day and doesn't include sales of circulating supply. Now, let's jump to May 2021, the month when doge hit its all-time high. Its market cap was over $85B. (Only a handful of coins have ever reached that number and freakin' doge was one of them 🤨🤯😵.) Let's take a second to clarify how market cap works: it doesn't take $85B of capital injection for the market cap to grow to $85B. There's actual math that exists to specify the exact number but for simplicity's sake, I always divide it by 10. Whether or not that is correct, let's look at it from that perspective: For doge to jump to $85B requires $8.5B of capital being injected. Now let's add in shib, as it never would have mooned like it did without doge doing what it did: shib went from $0 to $40B, which means roughly $4B went into it. Total: $12.5B extracted from the market (and in addition to that, the money from the other memes that mooned too hard and the whole meme coin fiasco that has since developed on the back of it) Now consider this: in the heat of the 2021 bullrun, at around $45K iirc, there was a study that came out that stated that $90M was required to move the price of BTC by 1%. That means that every $1B of net capital injections was worth about 10% to the price of BTC. Now, take the reckless financial decisions of millions of dog coin investors and instead put that money into more prudent places like BTC and other top-10, -20, and -50 coins and it becomes obvious that the $12.5B+ (plus the carryover of momentum to safemoon and other dog and ""safe"" and ""moon"" and similar coins/tokens) and it is obvious that Elon Musk alone is responsible for cutting the Bitcoin bull run by maybe as much as 100%. Imagine that... all of the moons this sub earns for ""$100K BTC 2021"" comments would probably never have been earned if not for the self-proclaimed dogefather. Someone find Elon's Reddit account so everyone can send him a thank you tip 🤫. These are serious financial crimes that should not be ignored by regulators and I as a God-fearing man believe that they will not be ignored by God either -- Jesus once said that a camel has a better chance of fitting through the eye of a needle than a rich man has of entering the Kingdom of God and I have to assume Elon's callous disregard for everyday people will guarantee him inclusion in the category of the rich men who never enter the Kingdom. This man proposed an alternative to the true financial instruments of the future, an alternative that is quite literally a joke that was never designed to be an investment vehicle and/or everyday currency... and he did this because his autistic brain thought it was funny. Let me repeat that: He thinks it's funny to F with people's financial realities. How out-of-touch can a person be? The man is sick. He should be reviled. He should be forced to make restitution to non-doge/shib crypto investors and then he should be put in prison.",0,25,2023-06-21 19:06:43,CryptoCurrency,DEBATE,"[('doge isnt investment meme', 1),

Crypto.com CRO app investment strategy,"I stopped investing in the app a few months before the eth merge. The income for the investments came from my small (21-25 GPUs on two rigs) GPU farm (still running today). Also was able to aquired enough coins (over 5000) to get two NFT's. traded doge I earned from a video game (passive income) at the ATH and for CRO and parked it into defi and sold all interest as it was aquired, doing some unstakes here and there to restake into atom mostly. Selling the crypto mostly covers my whole term life insurance payment which is close to maturing and a credit card I havent used for 4 years. As it stands I have funds locked in about 8 defi projects for four years that feel like its bottom, all of which have lost more than half of its value since I invested in them... Should I sell my mining equipment? I treat it like a loan from my power company in the summer and heat in the winter and I've spent the crypto winter making them as easy to maintain as a water heater ( many years of monitoring, trial and error) Did I do good?

Surprising list: The top 5 coins by marketcapitalization without VC tokens.,#The next cycle will be about utility If my assessment is correct the next cycle will be about privacycoins as well as OG POW coins that simply work because of cheap transaction fees and better coin distribution which means they are less prone to manipulation (read: less inflatable without real USD) compared to (premined) VC tokens where supply is highly concentrated and controlled by only a few hands. It will be fun to watch projects that have actual utility today rise to the top again while VC tokens comparatively stagnate. #Top 5 coins based on proof-of-work (PoW) Rank |Coin | Exchange Rate |

What should be your exit strategy...,"So as the new market cycle is near, and we all want our coins to moon. People talk about DCA strategy, bottom buying aka bottom fishing. Mr X want's to talk about exit strategy. Mr X has been in the crypto market for a fair amount of time. So around 2017, Mr. X had bought 100k Dogecoin at a quit cheap price. He spent around 150$. Didn't think much at that time, Doge was a fork of Litecoin and one of the earliest coin which was with BTC. The thought at that time was pretty simple. Mr X missed BTC , so why not try to catch the next BTC. So Doge slept for few years and suddenly one day Doge woke up. Mr X also woke up and couldn't believe his eyes seeing a 100% increase within 24hrs. Mr X did not had any exit strategy. He did not sell it then, thinking it will go higher. He was not wrong , after a pause doge went higher. Mr X did not sell thinking he waited again for it to go higher. He was getting a good money. Even if he would have sold 70-80% of his holding, he would have made 30,000$ easily. He thought to wait for more gains. He became greedy. Then Doge finished it's run and profit taking started, but Mr X was still waiting. Doge lost its zero. Came back hard, Mr X panicked and slowly started selling, thinking probably he will not make any profit. He sold all of his Doge. Did he make profit ? Yes, but not what he could have made if he would had a good exit strategy. At one time he would have made 40k$ but now he made only 2000-3000k . So guys don't be Mr X, have a good exit strategy. If you are making a good amount of money, sell 50-70% of your holding, don't worry, market will bleed, you will get the opportunity to buy it again at a discounted price.

"I bought $1k of the Top 10 Cryptos on January 1st, 2022 (MAY Update/Month 17/-70%)","https://preview.redd.it/n37nducwpd8b1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b5482dc92572839b2f4ff2611e685c2d1c94613 Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17). Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the seventeenth monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX. SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JUNE Snapshot). tl;dr What's this all about? I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include stablecoins) [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/). MAY Highlights: \- XRP easily wins the month, followed by ETH in second place. Rest of the coins well in the red. 2022 group worst performing Top Ten Portfolio, by far. DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period (see below for details). ## Month Seventeen - Down -70% https://preview.redd.it/ha57jd5xqd8b1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e0a1b5b59b40a1058dec46a2c26fb12cf4830d The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX. May highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio: XRP and ETH finish the month in postive territory, the other eight severely in the red. XRP passes BNB to claim first place, down -40% and -41% respectively. The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the six [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -70% as a whole. ## May Ranking and Dropouts Here's a look at the movement in ranking seventeen months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment: https://preview.redd.it/ddfaqrkyqd8b1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=a550810e73cff42b5fa58ac18ffff219f7874c45 AVAX, DOT, and LUNC have dropped out, replaced by Litecoin, DOGE, and MATIC. ## May Winners and Losers May Winners - XRP (+9%) easily won in May, followed by ETH (+1%). May Losers - Terra coins UST and LUNC performed horribly this month, down -34% and -22% respectively. ## Overall Update: XRP overtakes BNB for the lead. All cryptos well in negative territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments. XRP (-40%) overtook BNB (-41%) this month to claim first position. Not far behind is BTC, down -43%. Ever since LUNC's (then known as LUNA) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent. The initial $100 invested in Luna seventeen months ago is worth $0.0001 today - the worst performance of any coin in any of the six Top Ten Experiments, by far. It's hard to remember/believe that LUNA was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of the 2022. At -70%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the six [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022: https://preview.redd.it/swjw96o5rd8b1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a98cd58bb09a6479b10b4f7ac5ae236ecb3747 Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -70%. The initial $1000 investment on New Year's Day 2022 is now worth $299. Here's a visual summary of the progress so far: https://preview.redd.it/j0ohwsz7rd8b1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e64d5992093a1bd2331bf6aad6b719645c3a40d As you can see, there hasn't been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/). The value has remained in the -66% to -80% range since [May 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5). ## A note on USDC/UST In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I've been doing since 2019 and thought I'd showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings. My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies. As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST then staking with Anchor. It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My UST is now worth $0.001, down -100%. It's a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I'm thankful that the lesson only cost me $100: I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder. ## Bitcoin Dominance: BitDom ended May at 46.1%. For context, that's exactly the same percentage as one year ago, in May of 2022. Chart below: https://preview.redd.it/ume5nak9rd8b1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ca92564d4c5cf537dc636116b40a8f2503898f4 For those just getting into crypto, it's worth paying attention to the Bitcoin dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. BTC. ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -37% (total value $628) 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +229% (total value $3,286) [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +379% (total value $4,788) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +87% (total value $1,870) 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -70% (total value $299) (worst performing portfolio) [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +32% (total value $1,317) Taking the six portfolios together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line: After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $12,188. That's up +103% on the combined portfolios. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021's all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%. Here's the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals: https://preview.redd.it/cl26fu3crd8b1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bed70be223ab7dae4105a96e86092a898915a32 In summary: That's a +103% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years. ## Comparison to S&P 500 I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/uhycuc7drd8b1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4b7e7f665ea509b338b935591004d1808697515 The S&P 500 is down -11% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year's Day would be worth $890 had it been redirected to the S&P. Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I've been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following: $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,580 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,680 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,310 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,120 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $890 today $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,100 today Taken together, here's the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,680. That is up +28% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +103% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios. The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: https://preview.redd.it/t9zo7mjerd8b1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd6a39496046ebf73ffe50d32351d509b723d0a ## Conclusion: As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto's volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you'll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets - at least at this point in the Experiment. To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures. Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

What makes a coin popular? (Spoiler: it is not tech or utility),"BTC...ETH...doge.. ADA...what makes a coin popular? Is it the technology behind them? I for one know a few things about the blockchain tech. Not as much as I like tbh. Why? There are so many of them. And I am not a coder or a net expert. And guess what? Neither are the whales nor your average investors. For us ""fully decentralized proof of work third generation blockchain with advanced sharding"" is just an excuse to tell ourselves what we have invested in is not stupid. Is it what they call utility? Now that's a fancy word isn't it? But what it really means? Does it mean ""possible use cases?"". If it is, we need to know about technical aspects which we don't. And even if a coinhas great utility, does it really means anything if that coin is not used for that utility? So maybe adoption should be considered along with utility? But then again, a coin might lose all of its ""utilities"" overnight. Like CEL. So what makes a coin attractive for people? One would argue that more often than not it is the price action. I love ALGO, I hold big bags of it, but it brought me nothing but losses and suffering. It is great in every bloody way except the price action. And let's face it, there are two types of crypto investors. Those who are here for the money, and lying sacks of shit. So yes. The most attractive property of a coin is its ability to bring back profits (yes, I know we are in a bear market. There are coins with great price action even in this market.) And for a coin to achieve that, there should be decent tokenomics, a healthy dose of investments, and enough public attention. And the public only knows about the later. There goes the reason why so many people charge mindlessly to buy the latest overhyped pyramid scheme shitcoin. And why at least for now it is not enough to be a solid, useful, secure coin in this circus. Unless you are ready to ""buy and forget"". Which In that case, I hope your patience finally pays off.",1,49,2023-06-27 18:06:02,CryptoCurrency,DEBATE,"[('hype sadly hype enough coverage social media lift shitcoin moon', 16), ('much hype build

"What coins would be included in an ""Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF?"" I'm asking because I think we really need one.","I've been a part of this subreddit for a few years now and it has become clear to me that we, as a whole, are terrible at predicting successful projects. In years past, we have collectively praised NANO, LTC, VET, ALGO, EOS, BAT, ICX and countless other cryptos. Some of these did well, some did incredibly well for a bit, some did not do well at all.. However, some of the coins this sub has spent many posts completely shitting on have done amazingly well. These would include: SOL, PEPE, DOGE, BCH, SHIB, TRX and many others. How is it that we are so bad at this? What can we do to change?? I think an imaginary ""Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF"" would be a fun experiment to determine whether or not our brains are working against us. If we could put together a collection of the most hated coins in the sub, what would that look like? How would it perform? What do you think should be included in it? Note: Before anyone jumps in to say ""wHaT ABouT BTc anD ETh?!?"" or something dumb like that: this post isn't about those two. They aren't part of this conversation.

Elon Musk announces he's suing Reddit for Intellectual Property theft after Reddit begins selling blue checkmark NFTs. [Satire],"What Happened: Late last year, Elon Musk began selling Twitters famous blue Check Mark for $8 a month. The check mark that was once synonymous with prestige on Twitter, has lost a lot of meaning as a status symbol. With Reddit selling Check Mark NFT's, this once famous symbol stands to lose even more value for Twitter Blue Subscribers. In order to protect the value for Twitter Blue Subscribers, Elon Musk has taken to Twitter to announce he'll be suing Reddit for Intellectual Property (IP) Theft, in the following string of Tweets. He then stated if Reddit wants to continue selling check mark NFTs they'll need to buy Twitter first, but they could pay in Dogecoin for half off. https://preview.redd.it/og8fpcfungua1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb9b0a1a4fb910b6869436afb777b037c106e39 Of Course Reddit had to respond to these statements. https://preview.redd.it/dn56gbtiogua1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5aca56f240be723fc8398f000fe406fa73e614e If you want to find out what happens next in this developing story.

Do you want to earn some bragging rights? Lots of people say they are addicted to watching charts, so now is a chance to prove how much of a degenerate you are.

Kitty Meme Coin,"The cryptocurrency industry has been a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. However, a new player has entered the game: meme coins. And one meme coin, in particular, is making headlines - Kitty Meme Coin. Kitty Meme Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the popular internet meme of cats. The coin has been gaining popularity in recent months, with many investors seeing it as a potential new player in the cryptocurrency industry. Some have even gone so far as to predict that Kitty Meme Coin is going to win the meme coin industry. So why has Kitty Coin been gaining so much attention? One reason is its unique branding. The coin is marketed as a fun, lighthearted cryptocurrency that is easy to use and accessible to everyone. This approach has resonated with many investors, who are drawn to the idea of a cryptocurrency that doesn't take itself too seriously. Another reason for Kitty Meme Coin's popularity is its strong community. The coin has a dedicated group of supporters who are passionate about its success. This community has helped to spread the word about Kitty Coin and has even developed its own online forums and social media channels. But can Kitty Coin really win the meme coin industry? That remains to be seen. While the coin has gained a lot of attention in recent months, it is still a relatively new player in the cryptocurrency world. It will need to continue to attract new investors and build a strong community if it hopes to compete with established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Additionally, the cryptocurrency industry is notoriously volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. While Kitty Coin has seen strong growth in recent months, there is no guarantee that this will continue. Overall, it is clear that Kitty Coin has captured the attention of many investors and has the potential to be a major player in the meme coin industry. However, only time will tell whether it can sustain its momentum and truly come out on top.",1,0,2023-04-20 09:20:56,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('hello post removed account less days old required comment karma make post submissions', 1)]",kitty meme coin cryptocurrency industry hot topic recent years rise bitcoin ethereum cryptocurrencies however new player entered game meme coins one meme coin particular making headlines kitty meme coin kitty meme coin cryptocurrency based popular internet meme cats coin gaining popularity recent months many investors seeing potential new player cryptocurrency industry even gone far predict kitty meme coin going win meme coin industry kitty coin gaining much attention one reason unique branding coin marketed fun lighthearted cryptocurrency easy use accessible everyone approach resonated many investors drawn idea cryptocurrency doesnt take seriously another reason kitty meme coins popularity strong community coin dedicated group supporters passionate success community helped spread word kitty coin even developed online forums social media channels kitty coin really win meme coin industry remains seen coin gained lot attention recent months still relatively new player cryptocurrency world need continue attract new investors build strong community hopes compete established players like dogecoin shiba inu additionally cryptocurrency industry notoriously volatile prices rising falling rapidly kitty coin seen strong growth recent months guarantee continue overall clear kitty coin captured attention many investors potential major player meme coin industry however time tell whether sustain momentum truly come top

Do you think Cryptos used for everyday Payments/Shopping will ever become normalized or had that ship now sailed?,"To give some context to what I'm referring to. Back when crypto was starting to get more popular and hitting new highs- many people along with corporate America and global markets seemed to be getting excited about the potential for crypto's integration into everyday life. This included a push for cryptos meant for every day purchases at places like AMC Theaters, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc.. I remember one crypto in particular in the US was focusing on this- Amptoken- I was kind of hyped on them in those times and even used a number of times to buy food at Dunkin with- also with Dogecoin I had in my account at the time. I sold my holdings of Amp a long time ago cause it seemed to be going nowhere With all that said- do you think we might see a comeback of cryptos that are used for everyday purchases or has the volatility of crypto essentially scared off most of the corporate world from that now?",24,155,2023-04-21 04:49:11,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('ping verified users associated payments uatlosio bot

Top 50 Holders of EOS control 94% of the total supply,"A few days ago I made a post about Dogecoin and the fact 66% of the supply is controlled by the top 100 addresses. Well I continued to do some digging into other cryptocurrencies and found that 94% of all EOS is owned by the top 50 addresses. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rmc9qqhekhva1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=8899d4d196c77c4f9d3acd9e0eb814e4d21d6b0a After seeing these numbers I did some more research and found this issue was brought to light 5 years ago on the EOS subreddit in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o7cdw/eos_rich_listgenesis_snapshot_statistics/?rdt=45022) and this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/news/top-100-holders-eos-own-75-or-11b-worth/) when the situation wasn't nearly as bad and the supply was smaller. Total Supply 5 Years Ago: 1,000,000,000 EOS Tokens | Total Today: 1,153,534,963 EOS Tokens (Supply increased 15.35%) At that time of that post the top 100 holders had around 75% of the supply and 5 later the top 10 addresses alone have more than that. These are the top 10 addresses today: 1. [eosio.stake](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.stake) | 253215017 EOS | 21.95% of supply 2. [eosupbitcold](https://eosflare.io/account/eosupbitcold) | 156399705 EOS | 13.56% of supply 3. [binancecold2](https://eosflare.io/account/binancecold2) | 81967940 EOS | 7.11% of supply 4. [eosio.fund](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.fund) | 68277906 EOS | 5.92% of supply 5. [j4obibe5lfv1](https://eosflare.io/account/j4obibe5lfv1) | 64885405 EOS | 5.62% of supply 6. [b1](https://eosflare.io/account/b1) | 64672348 EOS | 5.61% of supply 7. [okbtothemoon](https://eosflare.io/account/okbtothemoon) | 61139288 EOS | 5.30% of supply 8. [eosio.rex](https://eosflare.io/account/eosio.rex) | 59021990 EOS | 5.12% of supply 9. [wlqdprkffody](https://eosflare.io/account/wlqdprkffody) | 36073985 EOS | 3.13% of supply 10. [kjhbgvcfghfd](https://eosflare.io/account/kjhbgvcfghfd) | 27249789 EOS | 2.36% of supply Though tbf the top holder with a little over a 5th of the supply seems to be a staking wallet. To all the EOS investors, does this concern you? If you aren't invest in EOS and you saw this would you consider this a red flag? Personally have never invested in EOS but this would be a red flag in my book. The fact that such a small number of addresses control such a large % concerns me.

The Bitcoin stack: Bringing Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos Ecosystem,"Intro The Cosmos ecosystem is full of innovative app-chains, built with sovereignty at their core. These projects seek to build their chains to serve a specific purpose, they wish to do on task, and be exceptional at it. One example I can name are Osmosis, an AMM that provides an extremely good UX, and uses various different capital efficient features to create light amounts of slippage and distributes tons of value back to Osmosis token stakers. A few app-chain, that will be entering the Cosmos soon, are Nomic and Babylon. Both are providing Bitcoin related services, to bring both Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem. Nomic- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn't use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side. Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well in the future. Babylon- Bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. One of the big use cases that can come from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Many Cosmos chains have unbonding times between 14-28 days. However, Babylons service could bring down unbonding times to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it's security preferences. Conclusion These two chains have work left to do, before they officially launch, however both plan to have mainnets in 2023. They lay the foundation to bring Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem, without centralized sequencers or 5/8 multisig attack vectors. Creating secure, reliable and decentralized products to make the Cosmos more liquid, and secure than it is today.",1,0,2023-04-24 19:37:35,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('nomic babylon become consumer chains launch set validators', 2), ('validator sets least start doubt feel necessary become consumer chains', 2), ('thank submitting rcryptocurrency post removed topic posted btc already limit posts allowed top may post topic longer limit click view current limits bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subreddit questions concerns', 1)]",bitcoin stack bringing bitcoin liquidity security cosmos ecosystem intro cosmos ecosystem full innovative appchains built sovereignty core projects seek build chains serve specific purpose wish task exceptional one example name osmosis amm provides extremely good ux uses various different capital efficient features create light amounts slippage distributes tons value back osmosis token stakers appchain entering cosmos soon nomic babylon providing bitcoin related services bring bitcoin liquidity security cosmos ecosystem nomic bitcoin bridge bringing btc cosmos ecosystem bridge doesnt use standard multisig validators operate large scale multisig requires consensus validators disperse funds bitcoin blockchain side making potentially one secure bitcoin bridges existence strict security framework bitcoin side bitcoin forks litecoin dogecoin likely bridged nomic well future babylon bringing bitcoin security cosmos babylon working timestamp transactions cosmos networks bitcoin blockchain add extra layer security data availability cosmos pos blockchains one big use cases come btc time stamping drastically reduced unbonding times many cosmos chains unbonding times days however babylons service could bring unbonding times potentially around day less depending chain security preferences conclusion two chains work left officially launch however plan mainnets lay foundation bring bitcoin liquidity security cosmos ecosystem without centralized sequencers multisig attack vectors creating secure reliable decentralized products make cosmos liquid secure today
What's your biggest crypto-related regret that you have?,"Everyone that dabbled or heard for crypto has probably shitload of regrets. If you heard for it early, if you pondered to buy BTC or some altcoin early but didn't, if you had BTC early but sold it too early, and on the other side if you overinvested into some shitcoin/scam that didn't pan out? What was it? Mine personally is when I wanted to buy 1 BTC in late 2013 when it was around $800 and it was having a big upwards rally in past few days. In the end I just gave up because I was clueless about how to buy it, I remember creating account on some website (it could have been Coinbase) seeing that I have to put my ID in and wait few days to verify and I just gave up. And then soon later it crashed due to Mt. Gox and similar scams that got to mainstream media so at that moment I was glad I didn't buy it. Probably for every crypto success story there's 10 other crypto fail/regret stories.

Secondly, I'm curious about good coins to invest in regularly. I'm planning on investing smaller amounts over time, so I'm not looking to make huge gains overnight. I'm more interested in long-term investments that have the potential to grow over time. I've heard of coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, but I'm wondering if there are any other good ones out there that I should consider.

At the same time we constantly hear about wanting mass adoption with the idea that crypto will replace fiat. What's wrong with both? Given how dead serious people get about one or other when it comes to commenting, it often come across contradictory knowing that people do both. I've noticed, We tend to especially talk down to people here that may actually find an exchange useful. I get and like the idea of self custody but with gas fees for exchanging it's not as convenient. At the same time I also get that it's not a good idea to keep the main nest egg in an exchange that could go the way of FTX. Main point is that I think we need to be less harsh about telling people what they have to do when different options work for different things. Side note since it will come up: Yes I know someone can pay from their own wallet but, we also need to think about people that pay or take various crypto payments that want to or prefer to convert (for fee) or deposit to their bank account. TLDR: It's not one or the other. It's completely fine to 1) hold your nest egg in self custody and also 2) keep some Dogecoin or XLM (examples only) in an exchange linked to a bank account for gas free exchanges and payments to and from people. Both serve different purposes.",14,42,2023-04-29 18:29:18,CryptoCurrency,REMINDER,"[('indepth skeptical discussion encourage readers use search listing help finding latest skeptics discussion thread

"""Community"" Meme/shitcoins are cults and damaging to mental health","Meme/shitcoin communities are cults and damaging to peoples mental health, yeah its true... especially to the mental health of youth. As funny as it may sound it's actually true, we live in a economy where it might be uncertain whether or not you will even be able to buy or rent a house/apartment some day. People will look at anything that can potentially make them money and fomo in. There are so many shitcoin projects and ""memecoin"" projects getting major exposure on social media as well as general media. This gets young people not understanding the risks of investment in these coins to invest mayor funds. You can call them dumb, but really is it their fault when they are so so desperate to make some money to make it in life? As media will say 1000x in just a week! People will fomo in and be basically held hostage by the so called ""community"" and gas fees and those bs ""tokenomics"". Saying don't fear just Hodl. Really? Hodl what? A token with literally 0 utility? The same thing is any other ""community"" token? The ""communities"" of these tokens are so deep into this whole scheme that they will say anything is fud even if it is the truth. And will say just hodl! Whilst watching their money go down the drain. These coins are literally all designed to lure people in and keep them captive, no rugpull needed. Focus and invest in real projects and other blockchains, not shit meme tokens that wont make you any money. It is literally insane to me thet shiba inu is number 15 on cmc based on market cap.

What's your favorite crypto story?,"Hello fellow crypto degenerates. I was just thinking about how many interesting and good moments we have had along the way and It has been a lot. From the guy buying pizza with Bitcoin to the Dogecoin meme pump. Also considering events which (I believe) were critical and important to cryptocurrencies development: from the very recent USDC re-pegging to the very first BTC transaction. For me, definitely the Bitcoin pizza story is my favorite moment: the fact that the same amount of BTC could be worth a couple of pizzas 13 years ago, while today It would be literally life-changing money, is really the symbol of how much this market has grown. Tell me, what is your favorite moment/story? EDIT: One of you reminded me of another nice moment which happened on this very sub. A guy from South America (cannot remember the specific country, but I think It was Venezuela) posted about getting his groceries with BTC.

"Rebutting the Argument, Moons will Never be in the top 100.","I'm posting this as a rebuttal to a popular post from four days ago, [""Why Moons will never be Top100""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12zz03g/why_moons_will_never_be_top100/). In that post Op made five arguments for why Moons would never be in the top 100, although some arguments have merit most others are bad faith arguments with no merit or validity. # Quick Reminder on Moons Op reminds everyone that Reddit has a stance Moons don't have value. Op acknowledges this is a legal argument from Reddit. Nothing else to add to this section. # Not your everyday shtcoin Ops states Moons won't pump because they aren't your everyday sh\tcoin and doesn't have any marketing. This argument ignores the fact it's probably one of the best known tokens of this SubReddit. Moon development is completely community driven, members of this community have 163 ETH in Liquidity and 1.435M Moons on SushiSwap liquidity. One of the best things about Dogecoin is the community that wanted to build and promote it. Moons have what many sh\t coins wish they had, a community that wants to see it develop. So no it's not your average sh\tcoin where people play the greater fool hoping to pump and not be burned. It's actually being developed in a grassroots way. # No one cares Op states since there are over 6M members of this sub and only 200k Moon holders (3%) it's proof that no one cares about Moons. Again this is another bad faith argument, a subscriber just means an account that subscribed to a community, it doesn't take into consideration account activity on Reddit. Many of those accounts could be banned bots or old accounts that haven't signed into Reddit for years. 200K Moon Holders is a ton of people. Sh\tcoins like Pepe dream of ever reaching 10K holders. A better statistic would be sub activity which is currently \~5,000 active members on at a time. That means the amount of holders is 40x higher than the active member count, so people who are active on the sub do care. # Holder repartition is a Red Flag Op claims having Moon whales means these accounts will dump their Moons and prevent any bull run. He also then creates a hypothetical disaster with liquidity providers based off a thought experiment. Again this is a bad argument, although it is true there are big whales that could dump Moons, there are big whales in every crypto asset that could dump. The largest individual Moon holder, holds just over 1% of the total circulating supply or about 2% if you don't consider Reddits Wallets. That isn't that much for a sh\tcoin. # Usecase > Pump Op claims Moons can't pump because people got them for free. So lets talk another sh\tcoin, AiDoge is pumping with a marketcap 9x larger than Moons, and it was given to people for free. Why would you buy this sh\tcoin when you could have gotten it for free or can get it for free? Yet the price is up nearly 10X since it first started being given out. So ignoring this flawed argument let's talk about Moons. Moons act as a Proof of Engagement/Reputation. The more moons you have the larger your virtual d\\k status symbol. People buy skins for video games simply because it'll make them stand out. Ignoring everything else positive about Moons, (Banner, Staking Rewards, most developed Reddit Community Token) people have and will buy Moons to stand out in this SubReddit. As the supply that gets airdropped every snapshot continues to decrease it will become harder and harder to earn moons, and large Moon holders will stand out even more, further incentivizing users to buy Moons to stand out. ........................

Do you think there could be a day in the future where crypto becomes bigger than the stock market?,This could be a fantasy idea but I think it could be an interesting scenario if it ever became possible one day. In reality if it ever would happen we probably aren't anywhere near that at this point in time. Imagine though- the year is 2050- crypto is more popular than ever. Bitcoin is a normal part of banks and salary payments. Dogecoin despite being a meme is now regularly accepted at Walmart. ETH has either upgraded to be more efficient or is taken over by something that has low gas fees and works easier. Now the fun part- some trends have flipped around and the world stock market is 10 trillion dollars while the total crypto market is 40 trillion. Crypto is now the preferred market even across the globe since it makes it easier to move around and deal with that instead of regular currencies.

Hard to believe stories moments in crypto world,"Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade now, and during that time, there have been many significant moments that are hard to believe. Here are just a few examples: 1. The First Bitcoin Purchase: On May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made the first-ever Bitcoin purchase by using 10,000 BTC to buy two Papa John's pizzas. At the time, the value of Bitcoin was only a few cents, but today those same 10,000 BTC would be worth millions of dollars. 2. The Mt. Gox Hack: In 2014, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was hacked, resulting in the theft of 850,000 BTC, worth over $450 million at the time. The incident highlighted the need for stronger security measures in the cryptocurrency industry and led to the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox. 3. The Ethereum DAO Hack: In 2016, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in a smart contract on the Ethereum network, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million Ether, worth over $50 million at the time. The incident led to a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic. 4. The Bitcoin Bull Run of 2017: In late 2017, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from around $1,000 to nearly $20,000 in just a few months, leading to a frenzy of speculation and investment in cryptocurrencies. The market eventually crashed in early 2018, but the event marked a significant moment in the history of cryptocurrencies and brought them into the mainstream consciousness. 5. The Dogecoin Craze: In early 2021, a group of retail investors on Reddit and other social media platforms began buying up Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that started as a joke, pushing its price up by more than 10,000% in just a few months. The event highlighted the growing influence of social media on the cryptocurrency market and the power of community-driven investment movements. These are just a few examples of the many significant moments in the history of cryptocurrencies that are hard to believe. As the industry continues to evolve and grow, there will undoubtedly be many more to come. What do you think about these moments in the history of cryptocurrencies? Are there any other moments you would add to this list?",18,76,2023-05-05 21:07:14,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('ohh forgot btc buried hard drive uk landfill 😅', 1), ('weekly stories', -1), ('comment

An ecosystem of Application specific blockchains,"The Cosmos Ecosystem is a system of sovereign blockchains, connected using the IBC protocol. Brief IBC explainer: An IBC connection is made, when one chains validator, runs a dedicated light client or node that serves the purpose of transmitting information from one blockchain, to a seperate light client or node. After that, each network agrees to the changes made to each network, and then the changes are made to the ledger. Interesting blockchains connected to the IBC: There are many IBC connected chains, that are currently in production or are soon to be. So I wanted to go ahead and list out some exciting projects and brief explanations as to what these projects do. Archway- Interoperable smart contracting platform (Cosmwasm enabled, explained in the JUNO section). Tokenomics include for a portion of inflation and fees to be distributed to the smart contract itself, allowing for Devs to use these new tokenomics in innovative ways to incentivize both themselves or incentivize their DApp users. Osmosis- Interchain AMM app chain. Basically, any chain that releases a token, ends up connecting to Osmosis so their token can be traded on the platform. Osmosis is also a permissioned layer 1, so smart contracts are starting to launch, with Mars Protocol being the first. Neutron- Neutron is a Cosmwasm enabled Smart contracting platform, that will be leveraging the Cosmos Hubs economic security, through Interchain Security. Neutron will also be home to Lido liquid staking services for the Cosmos Ecosystem, as well as the Astroport Dex. The Neutron proposal to join Interchain Security actually passed on May 5th. It sill have a launch period from May 8th to May 21st, for validators to spin up the node to run Neutron. So essentially May 21st should be the day that Neutron is launched and functioning as a sovereign blockchain utilizing the Cosmos Hub validator set for economic security and in turn, Cosmos Hub delegators will earn NTRN tokens. Nomic- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn't use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side. Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well. Babylon- bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. Tone of the main use cases that comes from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Estimated to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it's preferences. Juno- the first Cosmwasm smart contracting platform in the Cosmos. Cosmwasm is a web assembly module, built to easily port into the Cosmos SDK, making it possible to add smart contract functionality to a chain, with minimal to no need for additional code. Juno has DAO DAO as an extremely innovative feature of the platform, which allows for anyone to easily and quickly create a DAO, and find it with any IBC assets. DAO DAO will soon have a lot more interoperability features and ways for it to expand its reach out into the Cosmos, while residing on JUNO as its main chain. Agoric/IST- JavaScript smart contracting platform. Created by Dean Tribble and Mark Miller, who's records i encourage anyone to look into. They have been writing papers on computer science and large scale distribution of code since the 80's. I digress, this platform runs on a form of JavaScript called Hardened JavaScript. Which makes JavaScript more secure than regular JavaScript, but still familiar for those who use Javascript as their main programming language. Agoric is also home to IST, an over collateralized stable token that will be backed by many native Cosmos assets. Sommelier- currently trading pairs on ETH, but soon to be a multi chain automated asset trading platform. This project uses trading strategies that are automatically executed via smart contracts and gains are distributed to stakers of its native token SOMM. Currently only has a few trading vaults on Uniswap, however the staking yield for SOMM, from trading is currently 12% with no token inflation at all. Akash- decentralized cloud storage. This projes seeks to provide cloud storage as much cheaper costs than it would be from a centralized provider, while also making that cloud storage decentralized and largely censorship resistant. Project has an active product for decentralized cloud storage, but it is still building out more features for it to scale to much higher capacity. This isn't an extensive list at all, but I feel like this covers alot of ground in terms of some of the most interesting and exciting projects being built in Cosmos, all of which can be found on Reddit or Twitter!

Pepe the Frog meme creator and copyright owner Matt Furie weighs in on the memecoin mania and says he's a Dogecoin maxi,"A bunch of self-proclaimed crypto influencers got Matt Furie on their Twitter space discussion to talk about Pepe and here's what he said: > Actually, this is the first time I've heard of it. What is Pepe coin? I've heard of Ethereum, I've heard of Bitcoin, and I've heard of Dogecoin; is it like that? Dogecoin's the best. I'm a Dogecoin maxi. https://twitter.com/enjoyoor/status/1655708365748686848 Since he has the copyright for the original Pepe the Frog meme, he has also been quite vocal against its use for cash grab NFT ponzis in the past. Sad Frogs Districts project which was among the earliest pepe-based NFT projects [was removed by OpenSea](https://decrypt.co/78788/pepe-the-frog-meme-nfts-opensea-copyright-dmca) after Furie filed a complaint against it around August of 2021. Given how many more NFT projects and coins have come up around the meme over the last month, it's going to be interesting to see if he takes any further action to protect investors. Anyone holding anything pepe related should beware since he's pretty serious about preventing wrongful use of the meme and had also [invoked the copyright law](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/21/16333162/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-dmca-takedown-fair-use-matt-furie) to prevent alt-right meme makers from using his work for spreading hateful content in 2017.

I don't need the $240 so if it's gone it's gone. Here's my logic. I just remember buying 1.2 million dogecoin for $100 and sold it for $200 back in whatever year. What's a $240 risk?

Opinion: DRC-20 tokens are better than BRC-20 tokens,"As some of you might now, in the last few days/weeks there has been some hype about tokens being on other blockchains. Those blockchains being namely Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Now just to clarify, I do not think that these are useful in any way. I believe that we already have a number of functional blockchains for tokens (ETH, POLYGON, BSC, and more) that are more than enough for what we need. I honestly don't think that we need to clutter up any other blockchains with tokens. However, when comparing the BRC-20 and DRC-20 tokens, Bitcoin and Dogecoin tokens respectively, I believe that tokens launched on Dogecoin have a higher chance for success. And the reason for this ti ply comes down to transaction fees. When BRC-20 tokens were hyped (again, BTC blockchain), the transaction fees skyrocketed, making transfers extremely expensive However, a few days ago with the DRC-20 token hype (Dogecoin tokens), there was no noticeable change in transaction cost. Despite having significantly more transaction (many x more than usual), there was no noticeable change in transaction fees. TLDR: I think Dogecoin based token have a higher chance of success than Bitcoin based tokens purely due to the fact that the Dogecoin network is able to handle a significant increase in transaction volume without skyrocketing gas fees",10,37,2023-05-17 12:29:21,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('drc tokens course keep dogs bay', 2), ('degens avoiding analysis testifies fact us came money tech', 4), ('btc need blockchain', 4), ('dont know chief would rather meme tokens memecoin rather meme tokens literal top bluechip crypto', 2), ('illsuited intent cares better suck', 5), ('shitcoins belong meme chain anyways', 4), ('agree stick chains meant handle tokens', 1), ('shitcoin', 3), ('car need tires', 3), ('doge bitcoin', 1), ('dogecoin already memechain think memecoins home drc tokens align dogecoin community brc align bitcoin community', 1), ('lets call drc shitcoins brc shitcoins personally dont think matters pile poop bigger', 5), ('get point dont forget security aspect bitcoin network secure dogecoins yeah gas fees pain', 1), ('shitcoins way equal', 1), ('best comment', 5), ('lungs need air', 2), ('like comparing shit poop', 3), ('belong toilet shitcoins like stubborn turds wont flush', 5), ('hype pump dump scheme', 1), ('useless shitcoins nobody buying another fad pass', 1), ('projects quick cash grabs', 1), ('let shitcoin games begin', 1), ('theres less traffic highways middle australia new york city', 1), ('tired shitcoins', 1), ('already dogecoin currency whether haters understand know anyone doge community believes tokens make doge made tokens currency shibes happy way meanwhile chains home scam meme tokens always whether maxis chains accept eth maxis love hate meme tokens yet celebrate increase eth value due scam tokens achievement eth true meme investors', 7), ('bsc better know shitcoin question marks', 1), ('kind nice bsc magnet shitcoins keeps crap away chains', 1), ('equally shit doesnt matter wrap turd turd turd', 1), ('say keep em doge let bitcoin thing', 1), ('really like tires need air', 2), ('concur', 1), ('eth maxis meme gains thee', 3), ('wouldnt download bitcoin', 2), ('dont fill gasses instead', 4), ('gas fees maybe afford', 1), ('mean lots much scalable alternative chains arent joke', 1)]",opinion drc tokens better brc tokens might last daysweeks hype tokens blockchains blockchains namely bitcoin dogecoin clarify think useful way believe already number functional blockchains tokens eth polygon bsc enough need honestly dont think need clutter blockchains tokens however comparing brc drc tokens bitcoin dogecoin tokens respectively believe tokens launched dogecoin higher chance success reason ti ply comes transaction fees brc tokens hyped btc blockchain transaction fees skyrocketed making transfers extremely expensive however days ago drc token hype dogecoin tokens noticeable change transaction cost despite significantly transaction many x usual noticeable change transaction fees tldr think dogecoin based token higher chance success bitcoin based tokens purely due fact dogecoin network able handle significant increase transaction volume without skyrocketing gas fees
Can Dogecoin replace Ethereum?,"Can Dogecoin replace Ethereum? Here is my stupid theory that is 100% wrong in a world that is not a simulation. The dogecoin transactions recently surpassed 1 million transactions for a 24-hour period with DRC-20 tokens being created. If you look at [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/) you will see that Dogecoin transactions have surpassed its own all time high as well as Bitcoin transaction all time high and is now on par with Ethereum's daily transactions. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/bqbucnmeuk0b1.png?width=2541&format=png&auto=webp&s=553753ed40a6aa9eb80fc47515b9aca8bdf14468 What is special about this is that there has not been any noticeable congestion on the Dogecoin network, and it is handling the extra volume well. The transaction speeds have not been dramatically affected and the average fee is still well below a penny. Compare that with the transaction fee for Ethereum and Bitcoin on this chart and you will see that Dogecoin is still superior for fees even with the insane # of transactions. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/e7osveo17e0b1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d87a49f738cc8c76d02dac133fca984099bdca1 So, if dogecoin can now mint its own tokens, have the same volume as Ethereum, all for a fraction of the transaction fee, what's to stop Dogecoin from replacing Ethereum?",0,76,2023-05-17 13:15:53,CryptoCurrency,SPECULATION,"[('short answer never', -1), ('', -1), ('found elon musks account', 12), ('fear one day everything doge parents doge house doge dog doge', 1), ('doge network great faster transactions less fees doubt replacing eth might far fetched meme around long time given', 2), ('word', 0), ('missed comedy flair', 2), ('world favor delete account', -7), ('shib gets blockchain', -1), ('doge transaction fees far high compared eth', -1), ('believe wrong fees absolutely fractions compared gas fees eth network', 5), ('comedy flair missing', 4), ('exactly wondering ethereum vs dogecoin even debate comparison', 5), ('hate gas fees lets get crazy', 0), ('come man', 0), ('im looking judgingly right 🧐', 0), ('nigeria replace usa', 0), ('rwhoosh', -5), ('hopium methamphetamines ✅', 0), ('lol', 0), ('oh pls stop making feel uncomfortable', 4), ('enter idiocracy', 0), ('', 0), ('title missed elon name', 0), ('comedy flair fancy drugs vivid imaginations tell us op 😅', 0), ('like saying gatorade replace penicillin', -1), ('forget comedy flair', 0), ('nope', 0), ('dogecoin token eth whole smart contract eco', 0), ('sir crab market', 0), ('hello elon slow day twitter', 0), ('dont know man lot nigerian princes', 0), ('fellow crypto enthusiasts bought doge lately really good try', 2), ('real', 1), ('comedy post right right', 4), ('woof woof im 🐕', 7), ('well flair checks 👀', 0), ('hmm post spits facts next pepe replace bitcoin 😂', 0), ('someone recognizing dogecoins value sub finally growing likingdisliking currencies like middle school love see', 0), ('nopemaybe kind paraller universe', 0), ('specifically used speculation suits title really believes', 2), ('fantasy', 1), ('doge smart contract platform unless feel trading shitcoins around thing platforms good', 1), ('comedy flair', 1), ('reaction cardano post guess kind funny though', 2), ('caught landslide', 1), ('fuck dumb x replace ethereum posts moonwhoring', 2), ('would rather pleased turn events', 3), ('', 0), ('cant delusional think doge replace eth', 0), ('parallel universe sure', 0), ('excuse stroke', 0), ('whats stop dogecoin replacing ethereum smart contracts tokens utility use full disclaimer minted drcs morning', 2), ('naw theres distinct lack moon post 👐', 0), ('unstoppable financial vehicle thats gon na take world', 3), ('let doge woof woof 🐕💸', 3), ('doge network transaction speed meets wow replacing eth much ambitious far fetched hey memes never die keep dogeing', 6), ('escape reality', 1), ('next question', 0), ('elon farming moons', 0), ('wtf', 1), ('dogecoin blockchain token riding another blockchain true smart contracts though', 2), ('soon ordinals hit btc said doge ordinals would game changer best worlds pow meme community long lasting coin use case', 0), ('doge dogeshit change mind', 1), ('comedy flair indeed missing', 2), ('apologize call every forked coin token', 1), ('haha sounds funnydogecoin meme based cryptocurrency used pettie transactionswhile ethereum versatile currency dogecoin unlikely replace ethereums capabilities ecosystem', 3), ('long story short', 1), ('long story short', 1)]",dogecoin replace ethereum dogecoin replace ethereum stupid theory wrong world simulation dogecoin transactions recently surpassed million transactions hour period drc tokens created look see dogecoin transactions surpassed time high well bitcoin transaction time high par ethereums daily transactions xb special noticeable congestion dogecoin network handling extra volume well transaction speeds dramatically affected average fee still well penny compare transaction fee ethereum bitcoin chart see dogecoin still superior fees even insane transactions xb dogecoin mint tokens volume ethereum fraction transaction fee whats stop dogecoin replacing ethereum
What kind of coins did you mainly buy?,"According to my observations, there are a few types of coins depending on their market movement and utility. 1. Bitcoin - first cryptocurrency, king of our hearts, leading the market since its creation. 2. Coins that show potential and deliver - projects like Ethereum that are promising novelties, solutions to problems, etc. and actually deliver good services and have great developers. This shows in their market trends as they usually make their way upwards over a longer period. 3. Coins that show potential but fail to deliver - Not all coins are scams. I do believe that some projects really mean to develop as solutions to some problems and are planning to upgrade the existing tech. Unfortunately as the time goes, their roadmap gets posponed and postponed. They might deliver but in a very stretched timeframe. Eventually people lose interest in them and only the religious bag holders still hope for the project's development. 4. Meme coins ""pump and dump"" - we all know these, they usually dont last long on the market, developers hype people into buying and then sell their bags, usually leaving other holders unable to even sell for loss. 5. Meme coins that pump and dump and then somehow stay there - Im talking about Dogecoin for example. First meant as a total meme, but now has its own blockchain and even some utility. For some it is not considered a meme coin anymore. Pepe might be going in this direction? Are there some that I missed?

"What was the first crypto currency you bought or mined, and why?","Long time crypto-head here, mining and buying since 2013, but still unfortunately not rich nor anywhere near a millionaire from what you might expect from a crypto og. I remember first hearing about Bitcoin back in it's early years, from a colleague of mine who brought my attention to this new ""internet currency"". Beans was pretty popular years and years ago if anyone remembers that (you're showing your age though if you do), so talk of a new internet currency made me instantly think of that. I was shown a Windows app where you could mine Bitcoin, but after playing with it for half an hour, I soon forgot about it. After all, you'd have to leave your PC mining for weeks if not months in order to get just 1000 or even 10,000 bitcoins. Crazy! Fast forward a couple of years, and my same friend said ""Hey, remember that Bitcoin, well they're now worth $100 each! My interest was peaked, but I regrettably I thought I'd missed the boat. Surely Bitcoin couldn't go up even more? So at this point I decided to buy a few Litecoin instead, as it was the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold"". Over the next year or so I became pretty engrossed in the whole crypto scene, and bought, mined and traded a bunch of different coins on exchanges such as BTC-e and Cryptsy. Then I started buying graphics cards to mine a combination of Litecoin and then later Dogecoin. I always thought Litecoin was destined to stay 2nd to Bitcoin, and up until the last few years, it wasn't far off. So I've got Litecoin to thank for getting me into all this and causing me to become a first rate degen.

What if crypto already peaked?,"Imagine the year is 2030 and bitcoin is still hovering around 26-35k more or less depending on the month. Still in the top 10 are bitcoin etherium and Dogecoin. The market rarely gets further than the days of the covid pandemic crypto spike/marketcap. Meaning people aren't getting 'rich' off crypto like un the early days, just mostly whales who can afford big risks in little pumps. That said at least there is some stability if the market is sticking around but maybe doesn't have the old hype that it used to.

Wake up - it's 2014...,"It's 2014. Your friends and family are doing the ice bucket challenge ; you are enjoying your new iPhone 6 - and your hear about a coin based on a dog meme called dogecoin. You join the subreddit and say hello and you are tipped 500 dogecoin by some generous shibe and they show you how to create your own wallet to hold the dogecoin. Suddenly you are in the world of cryptocurrency - but here's the thing... The price isn't much to brag about but the community was blossoming and thriving. So much was done in that time - from the 98 dogecar, to the Jamaican bobsled team and people from all over the world coming together as a community and spreading the word of dogecoin. Flash forward - people have made their money - the whales have squeezed it dry and the original dev has abandoned it. The community seems to have migrated to blue bird and has certainly lost the spirit it once had.

The Bitcoin stack in Cosmos: How the Nomic BTC bridge and Babylon Bitcoin timestamping work,"Intro The Cosmos ecosystem is full of innovative app-chains, built with sovereignty at their core. These projects seek to build their chains to serve a specific purpose, they wish to do on task, and be exceptional at it. One example I can name are Osmosis, an AMM that provides an extremely good UX, and uses various different capital efficient features to create light amounts of slippage and distributes the value captured, back to Osmosis token stakers. A few app-chain, that will be entering the Cosmos soon, are Nomic and Babylon. Both are providing Bitcoin related services, to bring both Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem. Nomic- Bitcoin bridge, bringing BTC to the Cosmos ecosystem. This bridge doesn't use a standard multi-sig, it has validators that operate a large scale multisig, that requires consensus from all of the validators, to disperse funds on the Bitcoin blockchain side. Making this potentially one of the most secure Bitcoin bridges in existence with such a strict security framework on the Bitcoin side. Other bitcoin forks such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, will likely be bridged from Nomic as well in the future. Babylon- Bringing Bitcoin security to the Cosmos. Babylon is working to timestamp transactions, from Cosmos networks, to the Bitcoin Blockchain, to add an extra layer of security and data availability to Cosmos PoS blockchains. One of the big use cases that can come from BTC time stamping, will drastically reduced unbonding times. Many Cosmos chains have unbonding times between 14-28 days. However, Babylons service could bring down unbonding times to potentially be around 1 day or less, depending on the chain and it's security preferences. Conclusion These two chains have work left to do, before they officially launch, however both plan to have mainnets in 2023. They lay the foundation to bring Bitcoin liquidity and security to the Cosmos ecosystem, without centralized sequencers or 5/8 multisig attack vectors.

Soon: UK customers not allowed to actually purchase crypto for 24 hours after signing up to an exchange,"Saw this article today: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/crypto-buyers-get-24-hours-to-change-their-minds-sghcf8k68 More great news for the UK crypto users(!)... - Content - People tempted to bet their life savings on bitcoin or dogecoin after one cocktail too many are to be protected by a 24-hour cooling-off period for crypto dealing, to be introduced by regulators this year. Crypto firms marketing themselves in the UK will be required to make new customers wait a day after applying for an account before being allowed to place their first orders, the Financial Conduct Authority has ruled. It also plans to ban ""refer a friend"" bonuses - the incentives paid to existing crypto customers when they introduce other potential clients to crypto firms. The FCA announced the adjustments to its rules on the promotion of crypto currencies to UK consumers as it revealed a huge increase in the number of people owning digital currencies. Five million people in Britain now own cryptocurrency products, more than twice as many as previously reported, with the average holding worth £1,595, the City regulator has disclosed. In one of the first comprehensive surveys into the thinking of crypto owners in the UK, the FCA found that while 40 per cent regarded the pastime as ""a gamble"" in which they could lose money, 46 per cent were certain they would make money eventually. Fear of missing out was cited by 19 per cent of buyers as a reason for purchasing, while 21 per cent regarded it as a way of getting rich quick. The research also found that 6 per cent of crypto buyers in its survey - equating to 298,000 people, once scaled up - were financing purchases through credit cards or other borrowing. While 31 per cent of buyers said they regretted their purchases, 55 per cent were happy trading in crypto and were not concerned that it was unregulated. The FCA put the number of crypto owners at 4.96 million in August 2022, or 10 per cent of all adults, up from 2.3 million in January 2021, suggesting that millions more people were attracted to the activity as cryptocurrencies were riding high in late 2021. The ""buying at the peak"" phenomenon was borne out by the 45 per cent of owners who said they had lost money in the 12 months to April 2022. A third still said they had made money in that period, though this was down from the two thirds asked the same question in respect of the 12 months to April 2021. Cryptocurrency prices surged in lockdown with the most commonly traded product, bitcoin, hitting a high of more than $64,000 in November 2021. It trades at less than $27,000 today. The report, based on a nationally representative sample of more than 2,300 adults, also gave the first official clues as to how people in Britain buy crypto. More than 70 per cent used an online exchange and of those, 60 per cent used Coinbase, followed by 28 per cent who used Binance. The US-listed Coinbase was this week accused by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of operating illegally, sending its shares sliding. The SEC has also sued Binance, accusing it of co-mingling customers' funds. Coinbase and Binance both deny wrongdoing. In the survey, the most popular cryptocurrencies were bitcoin, held by 60 per cent of UK crypto owners, followed by ether and ethereum (48 per cent). The size of owners' holdings varied hugely, with 39 per cent saying they owned less than £100 worth. Five per cent of respondents, or 248,000 people, owned more than £10,000 worth, and 16 per cent of owners said they had used crypto to pay for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies are digitally generated representations of value in which every transaction is recorded on a decentralised database. They are not usually backed by fiat currencies or other assets and are not regarded as money by most governments. There are said to be more than 22,000 different kinds. Critics say crypto has no intrinsic value and is a bubble driven by greed and favoured by criminals. Supporters say that some cryptocurrencies could one day replace fiat currencies. Sheldon Mills, an executive director at the City watchdog, said: ""It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice."" Dan Moczulski, UK boss of eToro, which offers crypto trading, welcomed the FCA move but cautioned: ""Regulation needs to strike the right balance.""",8,57,2023-06-08

I've been thinking about a comment I made once and I get it,"""Back"" in 2021, I asked someone who had ""been in crypto for five years"" why they aren't rich. I get it now. I started in Dogecoin and as embarrassed to say, Safemoon. Thank the maker that I got out of that barely in the green. I've learned DCA and that Bitcoin is King. Say what you want but there is no denying the best anything to own right now is Bitcoin. I don't want real estate, I don't want cars, I don't want comic books.

"Crypto.com gave a crazy as well as conflicting response to allegations of acting as their own internal market maker. They admit to having one, contradicting previous employee statements, and also claim but they're necessary for the supposedly ""tight spreads"" that CDC has.","Crypto.com was questioned in allegations as acting as their own market maker. In response, Crypto.com said: ""We have an internal market maker that operates on the Crypto.com exchange and that internal market maker is treated exactly the same as third-party market makers that identically facilitate tight spreads and efficient markets on our platform."" This is a very odd statement. First of all, it is a big conflict of interest for an exchange to have their own internal market maker. In addition, this statement directly conflicts with previous statements by internal staff execs and internal staff that CDC who strongly denied it, claiming that CDC doesn't have any internal market making operations. This is raising A LOT of questions about CDC. But further, for anyone who has dealt with CDC, you have realised that they have VERY high spreads. If you don't know, spread is the difference between the offered buying and selling price on the exchange. In fact, CDC probably has the highest spreads on the market. CDC might actually be best known for their high spreads. For them to claim that their internal market maker is necessary for the ""tight spreads"" is wild and just doesn't hold up. Here are some examples of customer feedback &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/hjgg3wnddy6b1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=6703b489810c71b2ca0bbd2180df81e3c1ed1161 &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/7eus84ugdy6b1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=17054b85d04bc95d6b13ae1432b159cc818acf38 &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/m5y0e0ljdy6b1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ec4ea417b9a120ea997a498e5ba4527b8913dc &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/l2ug8jsndy6b1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=c85f9fbdeb46e0cdfcb6dba3433238cce3c6efe5 &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/6l84kgbiey6b1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=af46610af7927624a6a2d92927775ccc66467d5c The above video is actually a great one to look into because it has many users who commented also complaining about the spread. And in the video itself, the youtuber shows that Bitoin has a spread of 1.6% on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) vs 0.2% on Binance. For Dogecoin, the spread shot up to 6.4% vs 0.2% on Binance. We know that Binance larger and would be able to offer lower spreads, but having an 8x increase for Bitcoin and further 32X increase for Dogecoin compared to Binance is ridiculous. I can promise you that these are just some of the complaints. On top of this, for USDC in particular CDC was charging users a hidden 1.5% fee for USDC to USD conversions. This began happening after the USDC depeg and no where was the fee disclosed. I cannot confirm that this is still an ongoing issue.You can view most on that here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/123nojp/cryptocom\_now\_charges\_at\_least\_a\_15\_fee\_for\_usdc/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/123nojp/cryptocom_now_charges_at_least_a_15_fee_for_usdc/) &#x200B; So they have a internal market maker and the market maker is there for tight spreads.

Shitcoin history - can we find out how that one moonshot happened?,"We all dream of the one moonshot shitcoin that will make us (for example) wife-changing money. For a while now, I've been trying to figure out exactly how some coins like Dogecoin or Pepe started their journey. What was the difference between PEPE and the other thousands of coins that just died? Was there that one reason in the beginning that made some people invest money? Let's face it: by the time we read about a coin in crypto 'news' or on this sub, it's already too late. No one who's heard about a coin on this sub is going to get rich from a $1k investment. Did anyone follow the PEPE hype for example? What happened and where did these people find out about it? (I'm not talking about the later stage when it was too late).

If layer one dogecoin payments are enabled the fees will be as low as .001 doge (or basically free). With the transaction fees being so low with a dogecoin payment option, creators will get 99.999999% of the subscription fee. If the creators get this much more via a dogecoin payment method it follows that of course a lot of creators will push for their subscribers to use dogecoin and a lot of their subscribers will because they would rather their money go to the person they are subscribing to rather than Android/Apple/CC companies.

I bought in when it was three a penny. While I ended up with like 74 DOGE, I watched it grow in value from a quarter all the way up to like thirty bucks and back down to I dunno, like $6. I remember my ex-wife talking some smack about 'the ideas I was trying to teach my son' and pulling out my 36,000% profit, at an average monthly gain of 1000% over three years. it felt sooo good that I haven't been able to get myself to just move out the DOGE.

DogeDayDoesntExist,"Look at every single ""doge day"" in dogecoin's history. I used trading view and chose the ""dogeusd bitrex"" chart because it has the most historical data for doge out of all the charts I could find on trading view 4/20/2022 - doge dropped 1.16% Within 3 weeks it dropped over 50% 4/20/2021- doge dropped 22.65% and dropped over 60% 3 days after 4/20/2020 - doge dropped 3.61% this time it actually increased in price after dropping for 2 days. Small drop. But still a red ""doge day"". It increased 37% over 10 days and proceeded to be stagnant for about 2 months with a decline I'm price over that time. 37% in growth in the week/days after dogeday, pales in comparison to the previous 50% and 60% drops we saw in the 2 years to follow this day. 4/20/2019 This time, doge had a green day on ""doge day"" it gained .05% in value and proceeded to drop over 15% in value 7 days later. 4/20/2018 Doge increased in price by 1.98%, so far this is the best price gains we've seen for doge on ""doge day"". From this day on, doge proceeded to drop around 60% before it found a low. 4/20/2017 Doge dropped just over 2%. This is probably the best ""dogeday"" in doge's history because after this day, doge totaled in increase of over 800% before finding its top. To be fair though, this was in the middle of the 2017 bull market. We are definitely not in the middle of the bull now. Perhaps the beginning, but we could very well still be in a bear market as well. Long story short. The day was was still red. And this day occurred in completely different market conditions. 4/20/2016 Doge increased 1.36% and proceeded to pump about 7% more in the coming days. This may be the only iteration where ""dogeday"" could actually be argued as legitimate. However, this ""dogeday"" did not occur at the begging of its rally but at the end. Doge remained range bound for another month after topping out around the 26th. 4/20/2015 Doge increased .6%. The months that followed provided volatility and stagnation. But ""dogeday"", yet again, was irrelevant. That is all the dogedays I could find on tradingview. With the data provided, ""dogeday"" had 4 green iterations and 4 red iterations. Statistically this day is a big ol ""nothing burger"" Doge day doesn't exist. Don't get your hopes up. Keep in mind that dogecoin has been on an upward trend since March 11th of this year with a total increase of around 67-68% in gains in about a month's time. What's that old saying? Buy high, sell low? No. It's buy low and sell high. I'll leave you with this question.

Reality check on the price of dogecoin,"Let me be blunt: The price of dogecoin has absolutely nothing to do with Elon's antics... Twitter, SpaceX, Tesla... completely irrelevant. The only reason the ATH got as high as it did was because the news was reporting on it. Elon's tweets may have bumped it a bit, but the main boost was all the news coverage of that event, which got us a lot of exposure. Unless the headline were ""SpaceX to launch Starship funded by Dogecoin"", this launch had no chance. The only reason we're seeing a slight increase right now is because there's a lot of people buying in the hopes that the launch would actually raise the price. The only thing that will raise the price is the amount that gets purchased and the number of people who want to get in on it. Buying the dip and hodling is the only way for the price to go up. BUT when the price goes up, DON'T sell, because the more you sell, the more the market gets diluted, the faster the price drops again. This is how pump and dumps work. Someone (e.g. Elon) gets everyone else to buy, which pumps the price for a bit, then they dump all their coin, which make the price drop again. They make a killing and the rest of us suffer. This is not FUD, this is basic economics. THAT ALL BEING SAID, I'm still hodling my 100K and will continue to do so, not because I expect to get rich, but because I believe in the coin and what it represents. The very fact that it is so stable, speaks to the power of the coin and it's ability to be a currency. People buying and selling and investing turn it into a commodity. The only chance for us to go to the moon is for people to use it as a currency. Buy and then use it to purchase goods and services. 1 Doge will always equal 1 Doge in my heart.",2,4,2023-04-20 16:24:08,dogecoin,Serious,"[('well said however would argue buying low selling high frequent cycles also helps dogecoin volume perfect world without whales antidogers sure price would go doge holder also opportunity make profit helping build dogecoin value otherwise dogers always stuck whale sand bags', 2), ('cant comment someone bought around right hovering around feel go though likelihood reaching anything past statistically low', 1), ('buy low sell high repeat sometimes quick cycle sometimes takes months', 1), ('buy low sell high repeat sometimes quick cycle sometimes takes months', 1)]",reality check price dogecoin let blunt price dogecoin absolutely nothing elons antics twitter spacex tesla completely irrelevant reason ath got high news reporting elons tweets may bumped bit main boost news coverage event got us lot exposure unless headline spacex launch starship funded dogecoin launch chance reason seeing slight increase right theres lot people buying hopes launch would actually raise price thing raise price amount gets purchased number people want get buying dip hodling way price go price goes dont sell sell market gets diluted faster price drops pump dumps work someone eg elon gets everyone else buy pumps price bit dump coin make price drop make killing rest us suffer fud basic economics said im still hodling k continue expect get rich believe coin represents fact stable speaks power coin ability currency people buying selling investing turn commodity chance us go moon people use currency buy use purchase goods services doge always equal doge heart

Dogecoin's Popularity Wanes As Rivals Emerge: What Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin has been facing struggles as other memecoins gain popularity, causing a significant reduction in its investor community. Despite experiencing a 20 percent spike in value year-to-date, the digital currency has dropped by approximately 5.39 percent this week, trading at around $0.084 on Friday. Other coins such as $PEPE and $WOJAK have emerged and contributed to the decline in Dogecoin's popularity. However, Dogecoin still maintains its position as one of the most traded and liquid digital assets, with around 5.4 million holders, according to on-chain data. The market for Dogecoin is still dominated by whale traders, who execute large transactions worth millions of dollars.

Best part is when my parents saw how much I got for my aluminum basically everyone on my family started keeping their aluminum cans for me!

The pitcher winds up, throws the ball and on the first pitch Dogecoin hits it out of the ballpark, winning the game.

"In light of the ledger stuff, I'll eventually move some of my doge to a paper wallet.","I'll be keeping my ledgers though, and treating them as warm wallets. Neither hot nor cold. In light of ledger's unintended reminder that trust is not an absolute, I've concluded that there is no such thing as a cold wallet. Moving to other so called hardware wallets isn't the answer for me, as they all require firmware. There's no pragmatic instance of a 100% hardware solution in the case of hardware wallets. They're just small computers, their hard drives are just non-volatile memory, and their software is in large part, the firmware. I like Fulvio's overall paper wallet approach, I've used it in the past. Time to revisit. But I'll use an air-gapped linux instance with dogecoin-core to generate private keys and addresses, to be saved to an encrypted thumb drive. I'll keep a thumb drive setup for running a node when I need it. I'll sync it once a quarter so it won't be that far behind at any given moment, and sync of course when I need to use it. But that has it's own issues of course. People just need to do some thinking and figure out what's best for them. There's no perfect recipe. I'll of course use some form of hot wallets for various things, just like I use sodogetip hot wallet for small tipping amounts.

Clarifying my previous post about Dogecoin and New York,"in 2014 I bought about $500usd in Dogecoin and have it stored safely in a paper wallet. I love dogecoin and am 99% a HODL'er. For the last couple years I have decided to use some of the dogecoin to buy gold and silver coins - just to spread what I have and to get some precious metals. Using JM Bullion, I made several purchases using Bitpay and everything was fine but then NYS decided to 'protect' me by banning dogecoin (crypto) transactions with these services. I know I can use the doge one on one but what companies allow purchases for precious metals while living in this WONDERFUL state of new york? What are my options to buy precious metals? I only want to use my doge to purchase silver and gold.

What are doginals? How DRC-20 is changing the cryptocurrency landscape.,"Hello everyone, I'm doog and I run The Bone. I know many of us are still in the dark as to what doginals and DRC-20 really is, so I thought I would make a short post on where this stuff came from. https://preview.redd.it/r6r6vacb3o3b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c4e7b61ddd3ca549ed080bb853a6fc5d7d8c35 # What are doginals? An introduction to DRC-20. Doginals - a word you may have heard recently, but what are they really? Where did they come from and why did they come about? I'm here to help break that down, but first, to understand Doginals, we first need to take a short look at their cousin, Ordinals. Ordinals have become a popular trend in the Bitcoin community as of late. Similar to NFTs, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets inscribed onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. This became possible through Casey Rodarmor's ""Ordinal Theory"", which created a system for individualizing satoshis and giving them unique identities. Similar to how Ordinals inscribe information onto the smallest units of a Bitcoin, Doginals inscribe information onto the smallest units of Dogecoin, named shibes. You see, each shibe can store a very tiny amount of information via a process we call ""inscribing"". By keeping track every shibe in circulation, a normally fungible token like $DOGE can be inscribed with data, tracked, and transferred amongst collectors, speculators, and enthusiasts. ## How the heck is any of this done? By using a tool called an indexer, which is just a fancy word for a platform that acts as a ledger for all of the data being written onto every single shibe in existence. Armed with an indexer, users can now create token and image collections on blockchains that wouldn't normally have the capacity to natively map this type of information. Plain and simple: Doginals came about as a spin on Bitcoin's Ordinals. Because Dogecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, they both have the capability to utilize Ordinal Theory. Amongst the hype of Bitcoin's Ordinals spawned a handful of other mirrored systems, including Doginals on Dogecoin and Litecoin Ordinals on, uh, Litecoin. ## So how did Doginals specifically come about? In February 2023, a developer named ""Apezord"" introduced the Doginal standard by launching the first Shibescription (shown below). [Shibescription 0](https://preview.redd.it/hl3gd7jp3o3b1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=e753ce2eaf25e92cbdd9ea415c19366e584ea090) This sparked the formation of a community where numerous Shibescriptions were created, ranging from texts to images to even gifs. During this time, someone also introduced the inaugural DRC-20 token, $DOGI, with a maximum supply of 21 million ""tokens"". Progress in the DRC-20 space has faced its fair share of obstacles, mainly due to the challenges posed by Dogecoin's random block rewards (that's a topic for another day). Projects have thus far faced difficulties in establishing a reliable indexing infrastructure which means sometimes your collection would be recognized as one thing in one place, and entirely different attributes in another. But, despite this, leaps are being made within the doginals community, and DRC-20 trading has been off the charts. On May 22nd, transactions on $DOGE skyrocketed, marking a new all time high of over 719,000. For reference, Bitcoin's transactions for the day - in the midst of Ordinals season still, mind you - was 566,000. Similar to Bitcoin's Ordinals, Doginals began to rapidly gain interest from the wider cryptocurrency community. The low fee structure of Dogecoin allowed many participants to begin minting all sorts of DRC-20s without too much overhead or risk. Plus, you know, being early to the next new thing in crypto never hurt. ## Not Everything that glitters is gold. Doginals have not been without their challenges, however - and there's been contention both inside and outside of the community when it comes to DRC-20. For example, one Dogecoin core developer [voiced](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RlY3J5cHQuY28vMTQwNDY4L2RvZ2Vjb2luLWFjdGl2aXR5LXN1cmdlcy13aXRoLW9yZGluYWxzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dGhlYm9uZS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj13aGF0LWFyZS1kb2dpbmFscyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI2Y2JjNGExMy00N2EwLTRjODQtOGY3Ny0yYzkwZjBkNDJlZWMiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImQ4NTg3MWZhLTlmOTEtNDhmZC1iM2Y3LTBiMjA1OGFkMWNiYyIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiM2ZkZDBiODctYmJiNS00YWQ3LTlmY2YtYjU1ODJiNjU3ZTNhIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg1NzMyOTEzLjIxOSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.HJTTwPf11u8QltVVVMPT8cQxvR9-4dogxdIFnQ9Uzwg) his skepticism, saying: ""Something like this cannot become a real 'feature' because it has not had enough thought given to it... Sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly."" \-Patrick Lodder Coincidentally enough, a similar sentiment was shared by Luke Dashjr, one of the leading Bitcoin Core developers, in relation to BRC-20. He went so far as to say that immediate action needed to be taken to stop the Ordinals trend. If you've attempted to transact with Bitcoin recently, you may have noticed the elaborately high fees. In case you need a quick refresher, as competition for block space increases, so does the cost to transact on the network. Case-in-point: Dogecoin network's transaction fees increased three-fold between May 10th and May 22nd. Thankfully, the fees are still relatively cheap due to the nature of Dogecoin's blockchain, but you get the picture. ## What's Next? That's the million dollar question now isn't it? I'm afraid the only answer I can confidently say is: Who knows? Ordinals are still new enough that we're seeing exorbitant volume on Bitcoin's blockchain, so we don't even have much to compare the current state of affairs to. Maybe doginals will fade away into the annuls of crypto history. Or maybe, just maybe, DRC-20 is the next evolution of $DOGE history. But, for a chain built on community, memes, and having fun, some might say doginals is just what the shibe ordered.",5,15,2023-06-02 20:52:46,dogecoin,Educational,"[('warning new account detected

There is only 139,742,006,383.71 DOGE (139 billion) On May 8, 2021, Dogecoin briefly reached its highest market capitalization of $88.8 Billion with a price of $0.6818 per Dogecoin. Let's assume these far off scenarios take place at the same day and time to make math simpler. Or in other words maintaining the same circulating supply. 88,800,000,000 = $.6818 For similar math let's us 88.8 trillion as world currency 88,800,000,000,000 = $681.8 per doge If 10% of worlds supply is invested/utilizing doge for its cheap transactions 8,800,000,000,000 = $68.18 per doge The us has $2,344,000,000,000 dollars (🤷🏽‍♂️) (2.34 trillion) This is roughly 1 doge being equivalent to $18.16 usd If 10% of the USD was invested in doge it would be $1.816 China has 10.47 trillion yuan in circulation at the end of 2022. That's 1,465,237,342,200 usd. If all Yuan was doge. 1 Doge would be 11.35 usd. 10% is 1.35. If 10 percent of us and china invested in doge. $1 doge would be $3.16 usd. Tesla is $789 billion dollars. 789,000,000,000 almost 10x doge at its peak. Almost $6.81 Amazons 978 billion. As of June 2023 Apple has a market cap of $2.890 Trillion. I don't even know how this is possible but As of April 2023, the total market capitalization of domestic companies listed on stock exchanges worldwide recorded as 108.23 trillion U.S. dollars.

Becoming a Doge millionaire and then going bankrupt,"I'm not sure if anyone remembers me, but I was the guy who became a millionaire overnight thanks to Doge. I bought a few thousand Doge coins back in 2013 very little, and then forgot about them. A few years later, Doge went viral and the value of my coins skyrocketed. I was suddenly a millionaire! I was living in a small apartment at the time, working a dead-end job. I had always dreamed of being rich, but I never thought it would actually happen to me. I was so excited! I quit my job and started planning my new life. I bought a big house, a fancy car, and started traveling the world. I was living the dream! But then, the price of Doge started to fall. I didn't think much of it at first. I figured it was just a temporary dip. But the price kept falling, and falling, and falling. Soon, I was losing money every day. I started to panic. I sold some of my coins, but it was too late. I had lost most of my money. I was devastated. I had gone from being a millionaire to being broke in a matter of months. I had to move back into my old apartment and get a new job. I was humiliated. I felt like a failure. It took me a long time to recover from my losses. I had to learn to live with the fact that I had made a huge mistake. I also had to learn to be more responsible with my money. I'm still not where I want to be financially, but I'm slowly getting back on my feet. I'm sharing my story because I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did. If you're thinking about investing in Doge, or any other cryptocurrency, please be careful. Don't invest more money than you can afford to lose. And don't get too greedy. If you're up big, take some profits and lock in your gains. Don't wait for the price to go even higher, because it might not. I'm still trying to recover from my losses, but I'm determined to come back stronger than ever. I'm not going to let this experience define me. I'm going to learn from my mistakes and move on. I know that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I just need to keep working hard and never give up.",1,0,2023-06-13 16:14:35,dogecoin,,"[('tldr dont trade emotions realize loss get scared confident enough investment forget explodes confident enough

Does anyone else get the feeling that the fud orchestra is a paid service? Now this is just speculation, but I feel like some individuals that control a large portion of a currency often use their wealth to pay less fortunate individuals to carry out the dirty work. It also feels to me that many individuals don't care about ethics or principles unless it suits them and will often try to use your emotions and values to make you act/feel/think a specific way about somthing to distract you from the actual picture and further their agenda. I don't and have never claimed to know much about monies or stocks. BUT I sure know what spear phishing scheme looks like (it happens alot and it's ridiculously sad). Protect your minds Fam! Make your own choices, always seek more information than what is being force fed to you. I have heard: Be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearfull when others are greedy.

In one week...,"I will start the award distribution for posts that uphold and spread the values of hodling the doge mindset. Doge says it loves each and every one of you that are spreading positivity and uplifting others, and wants to show support for positive things that people say regarding its true nature. Much like doge, a simple award can make a world of difference to someone. Like a cop trying his best to serve his community, whom is having a rough day, who's spirits become lifted with a simple ""Thank you for everything you do for us."" As a result he now has happy thoughts and works in a state of pure positivity for the rest of his shift, benefiting every single person he interacts with for the means of the greater good. Don't clown on this fellow Shibes. The importance of mindset is much greater than most would like to realize. Change your mindset, change the world. Awards will help those whom get them in a simple way that can be cultivated into something much greater than an award. Those that need such a thing will be the ones whom recieve them. I have no control over this other than the fact that I will be distributing them. The idea of who is bound to recieve them definitely won't come from me. We have no control over the ideas we have. Remember that. Trust the ideas that spawn from a Doge mindset are what will change this world towards a path of greater good. Doge isn't about money.

Nearly a decade of dogecoin and why I'm still (mostly) hodling,"9 years ago someone from some sketchy forum sold me 20k dogecoin for $10 via paypal - Today those 20k dogecoins are worth around $1200usd. I have accumulated enough doge that I feel that I am comfortable with the amount and am already happy with the amount they are worth today in USD. It took years of believing, forgetting, learning, questioning and deciding that I'm going to mostly be a HODLer. For YEARS my doge was worth like $.0025 and I remember I almost cashed the entire amount out for $900usd. but thankfully got lazy and forgot about it.....then one day.....bam. It's worth a PENNY! We are now 6x that amount and people are complaining.....I get it - you bought when it was higher but just HODL - it will work out soon I have cashed out enough to furnish my entire podcasting setup - new mics, rodecaster pro 2, Mac, monitors, etc etc. - I also used a bit in the days of $.40 to buy a 1972 VW Beetle. Without Dogecoin I wouldn't have made these purchases as easily. My friends ask me why I don't just 'cash out' and the only answer I can give is, I believe dogecoin will make me rich, I mean, It already made the best profit I have ever made and dogecoin has never let me down.

Raising money to fix a bike.,"Henlo Shibas. I would like to raise money to fix a kids bicycle. He took it apart hoping to fix it ( He is12 years old) but it turned out He can ́t and broke the parts ( Shift,brakes and even the chain). I promised to the family I try to fix it ( I thought it ́s an easy assembling job but I didn ́t know the parts are literally broken). I wrote a list for them what I need to repair on the bike ( cost 100-150 €) but They said it ́s too much money but they wouldn ́t accept my money but I know the bike is very important for the boy, So ladies and gentleman I found my old PHYSICAL DOGECOIN and I would like to sell it just for as much as it gonna cover the repair cost. So if someone would donate or buy the coin from me please let me know. Of course I ́m gonna send the receipt from the parts and pictures how the repair goes. Maybe it ́s a silly idea but that ́s all I can do.

Perspective from the outside,"Although the intrinsic value of Dogecoin is strong, unfortunately, public perception of the cryptocurrency is quite poor. Ongoing volatility within the crypto market only reinforces this negative perception, causing potential investors to shy away and ultimately diminish the overall intrinsic value of Dogecoin. However, if you have faith in the asset, invest and hold onto it for 5+ years. The reality is that Dogecoin is poised to skyrocket, and by investing now and holding onto it, you stand to earn far more than by attempting to time the market with every dip. It's important to note that reducing volatility is crucial to improving public perception and gaining widespread adoption of Dogecoin. The faster this happens, the quicker the public will gain respect for the asset and embrace it.",1,0,2023-04-24 21:15:24,dogecoin,,[],perspective outside although intrinsic value dogecoin strong unfortunately public perception cryptocurrency quite poor ongoing volatility within crypto market reinforces negative perception causing potential investors shy away ultimately diminish overall intrinsic value dogecoin however faith asset invest hold onto years reality dogecoin poised skyrocket investing holding onto stand earn far attempting time market every dip important note reducing volatility crucial improving public perception gaining widespread adoption dogecoin faster happens quicker public gain respect asset embrace

How did they steal all my Dogecoin and what can I do about it?,"About three years ago, I bought a lot of dogecoin on Binance. Then, to make it safer, I followed the instructions on this page to get in into a paper wallet: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin\_paper\_wallet\_tutorial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7jyz3f/dogecoin_paper_wallet_tutorial/) I disconnected my computer from the internet, generated several paper wallets from walletgenerator, and then sent the coins to a wallet. I printed off the paper wallets, and have never saved the wallets to my computer or showed them to a friend or anything. I never did anything with the Dogecoin. Never linked it to any sort of online account or app. Never entered the wallet information into any sort of website. Never sent any Dogecoin from it, or did I ever put any more into it. I just left it alone. Today, I decided to see how it's doing, only to discover that back in November, someone stole all the dogecoin out of the wallet. It is empty. Gone.

NFTs are a joke.... so they should be on Dogecoin!,"&#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/7b6zzbjfgk0b1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dc882c4e2250f664ebee298eab74f3edb4234d8 Hello everyone! I am a guy from Germany that spent more time than he likes to admit on an NFT-Protocol for the Dogecoin Blockchain. And since everything seems to be working great it's finally time to at least tease the idea of NFTs on the Dogecoin blockchain. That being said, I know that NFTs are a disputed topic and probably not everyone wants to see them on Dogecoin... Therefore I will at first only release my own NFT-Collection (see details below) before setting up an environment in which everybody can deploy their own NFT-contracts on the dogecoin blockchain. This will remove the risk of network congestion and will give enough time to analyze the effectiveness and security of the protocol before releasing it into the wild. &#x200B; The Dogecoin NFT Protocol only uses regular Dogecoin transactions. So unlike Smart Contracts it isn't something directly integrated into the blockchain but instead acts as a layer on top of Dogecoin. More details about the implementation will follow soon. Probably at first in the form of a video since I feel it will be easier to explain stuff that way. A Whitepaper would likely follow after that. &#x200B; The protocol currently supports the following functionality: creation of ""dumb contracts"" add/update contract metadata add/remove contract owners mint/burn/transfer/sell/buy NFTs &#x200B; My own NFT collection is a trading card game based around a fictional war between all cryptocurrencies called ""The Crypto Conflict"". You can use your NFTs to virtually support and attack cryptocurrencies. Supporting a currency with your cards will increase its military power while attacking will reduce its military power. There is a leaderboard on the homepage that will always display which cryptocurrency currently has the most military power. The website is already online (though only for testing purposes) at [www.cryptoconflict.net](https://www.cryptoconflict.net) There you can also view all of the 52 cards that will be available at launch. Each card has a (hopefully) funny design and flavor text about cryptocurrency or trading related terminology.

"Not a financial expert, but some advice that helped me","Is see a lot of people talking about the dip, and asking when the price will surge again. Whether they should Hodl, buy more, or sell. Ultimately it will be based on the person themselves. Where I'm at right now I feel I would feel more upset if I sold everything and the price skyrocketed in an amount that would help me than if I were to lose it all in a Dogecoin crash. Because of this I will pop on Reddit everyone now and then to see if there's any news, but I do my best not to obsessively watch Dogecoin price and my earning. It creates far too much stress and gives me an unrealistic expectation for it. As others have said here, it may take years before it hits a high prices IF it even does. It's best to not only have a diverse portfolio, only invest what you're comfortable losing, and keep expectations realistic. Would it be amazing if Dogecoin hit $10 this year? Absolutely.

Dogecoin has overtaken bitcoin in terms of the number of transactions,"The volume of transactions on the blockchain of Dogecoin has reached an ATH at 628,209, ahead of Bitcoin and Litecoin. The reason why transaction increased on the doge blockchain was because of traffic that came from several large addresses that made small transfers. One of these wallets sent 5766 transactions per day. In recent days, there has been unprecedented activity on the Dogecoin blockchain. According to DogeWhaleAlert, on May 11, an unknown person moved 13.07 million DOGE ($927,413) to several different addresses, spending $0.26 in fees. The transaction came after Elon Musk announced his resignation as CEO of Twitter.

How and Why I came into Investing in $SSB (Previously known as Derpy) and #SatoshiSwap (Might take around 3 to 4 mins of your reading time).,"In late 2020, a friend of my introduce me to the world of Cypto. It took me a few weeks of researching what was it all about and the various coins on the market. I made my 1st purchase in Doge on Feb 3rd 2021 at around $0.04 (FYI I miss my initial entry in Dec 2020 when prices were below 1 cent as I was still not comfortable in investing in Crypto) and subsequently into Shiba Inu, Safemoon, ...etc. I have to be frank I was quite lucky in a sense that I got in early before the real pumps came in and overall made 10x what I put in after offsetting the losses in some shit coins and con jobs (using the 4 points written below). Along the way I refined the basis of of my entries after going into Wall Street Bets and subsequently by chance into Satoshi Street Bets. It was here that I came to set up my personal ""Crypto Investment Philosophy"" or ""CIP"" as I would like to call it 1) Coins with real world utility or striving towards it; 2) Coins backed by Strong Communities (hardcore); 3) A team of dedicated founders and developers; and 4) Good trading volume Along the way I notice a frequent person posting known as Little Eagle and little did I know that that person was actually David Gilbert the founder of this group until subsequently (FYI I was scanning daily through this reddit group and a couple of others for coins meeting my 4 criteria) so one day he mentioned that he wanted to come up with his own brand of Coins with some utility of a margin trading Dex so I decided to keep in view the developments. As the weeks pass by in 2021 and more details were released I come to a decision to invest into Derpy and Swap and did the Whitelisting and KYC and participated in Copper Launch (FYI I did not sleep for almost 48 hours by checking the prices every 30 mins as I am very careful of where I put my money into, I even made a forecast of the price decay and it was almost 95% correct and happy to say I bought in at almost the bottom when the volume and prices started deviating from my forecast.). The actual reasons for me to invest was due to the very stringent criteria needed to buy the coins and the reasoning David gave which was not like those pump and dump coins where whales swoop in and then sell, rekting the small fishes. I studied the entire whitelisting process, search on Diamond Hands Consulting Pte Ltd, the Law firm appointed, ...etc And so the journey started, along the way certain elements of the Margin Trading Dex were altered and deadlines were pushed but it was all explained in a transparent fashion and boy did the evolution of the utility products evolved into a more sophisticated product then what was initially mentioned. Over the months the numbers of Wen Moon/ lambo boys came down and the telegram group was left with a group of dedicated investors. Its frankly very heartening to see David and the developers continuing to build over the crypto winter. The money gained during presale is still around and not rugged and you can check it in the blockchain yourselves. Around late 2022, David came and told us that he had won a lawsuit against the fake SSB coin. I took it up and started searching for whatever information that is publicly available and came across the court proceedings at the New York Circuit Court, the name of the Judge, the Trademark applications and the various jurisdictions the Trademark has been applied for. This put me in a position where my trust in David and the team has risen up a few notches as you know litigations are not a small matter and to have the dedication to see it through and win makes it even more admirable especially is that it was won in America where there is a lot of bias towards crypto recently with operation chock point 2 in progress. I have to admit that I have been interested and invested in this project way before the 99% who came in recently and have seen the progress made over year. To those new investors, currently the progress of the Charting Platform is in its final Beta form and quite a number (more then 50 of them as far as I am aware) of the regulars at the SatoshiSwap telegram has been testing it although I do feel a tad disappointed not to have been one of them but hey thats life and you can't always be at pole position. As for the Dex as far as I know is that it has gone through 2 audits and is almost ready to be integrated with the Charting Platform. I read thoroughly through the 1st Audit Report and the minor issues found. Overall the final product is almost coming to fruition and the bull market is almost upon us, its like Crypto spring at the moment and the products and integration is almost on hand. You should really go read up at [https://ssbcoin.com/](https://ssbcoin.com/) and [https://satoshiswap.net/](https://satoshiswap.net/) for more information related to the 2 coins. (Disclaimer: The above is NOT I repeat NOT financial advise and YOU SHOULD always DYOR before investing into any financial product not only in Crypto but others such as Stocks, Insurance,

$PEPE is Ready to make Tendies only IF*,"So let me start with some classic dope things: this is NFA so DYOR, dance YMCA while singing BYOB, put your NASA suit, and don't be a FED because I will call the FBI and CIA before going to MOON. Ok I think we are good to go. Let's see how far my autism let me... never mind. An ERC-20 Token called $pepe was created on April 14th on the ETH blockchain with only 4 ETH of liquidity and it was well received by the crypto community + NFT community in matter of days in such a massive way that it brought the memecoin season to crypto by storm soaring over 4000x in only 19 days reaching 1.6B dollars of Marketcap. Ok that's the relevant data because we ain't looking for utility or any shit like that, this is not a security remember that, we only want the price goes up so we can pay our wife's boyfriend trip to the Bahamas before summer ends. Pepe is not anymore a memecoin, is a ""culture coin"" and it can be compared only to Bitcoin (until it flips it). Warning: I can make a full explanation of why $pepe will be better than BTC, so don't mess with me because you will dump every single asset to go all in on $pepe. CURRENT $PEPE SITUATION : $pepe right now is taking his time to accumulate or whatever the fuck that means because BTC puked himself due to the villain of this year G.G (ifykyk, good game) BUT! that doesn't mean anything to a frog that's able to Jump really high, in fact the frogs can jump even 50 times their length (source: Internet) , and I think this calcule is kinda conservative due to the fact that this frog is the Giga Chad Frog of the internet, so, would be kinda retard think that this will act like a normal frog. WHAT CAN YOU DO Buy $pepe and wait till you get rich. Bloomberg will never recommend this because I heard that Mike doesn't like the frogs because when he was a kid one jumped on his face and that event was turned into a childhood trauma. And now the IF $pepe will jump ONLY IF you start dumping the dog coins because at this point they are worthless, any influencer telling you to buy any dog coin is a scammer and you will be their exit liquidity, SO DO NOT DO IT. The last time Elon tweeted about doge the price didn't even reacted, and that's because Elon lost his dog magic sauce... But don't forget that $Pepe is the most memeable THING in the world, and Elon loves memes and he knows that he needs to be really careful about his tweets because if he adds a frog, $pepe jumps 40%, just think about it.

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021. Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago. Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility? Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors. Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market. The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market.
