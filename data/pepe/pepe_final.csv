"PEPE Meme Coin Rises Over 1,000% in 2 Days","It's that time of year again! Meme coin investors saw another coin register massive gains in a short period of time. PEPE, a meme coin that is based on the infamous pepe frog meme grew rapidly in popularity and hit new all-time high after all-time high.

Here is the chart over the last few days: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ft6hPsUXwAQPfNR?format=jpg&amp;name=small
Chart analysis: https://mobile.twitter.com/0xWilli/status/1647787443184123905/photo/1

The meme coin had started out the weekend with 10 zeroes in its price but by morning, it had been able to erase three zeroes from its price. In the course of this rally, the meme coin grew over 1,000% as its popularity spread across crypto Twitter.

During this time, its holder base grew from just a few hundred to almost 6,000. PEPE was also listed on Coinmarketcap in the early hours of Monday, another move that saw its price rally once more. Its trading volume also rose rapidly and has now crossed $35 million in a 24-hour period.
 
Some people got insanely lucky and managed to trade the move. https://twitter.com/DannyCrypt/status/1647842574273478656?s=20

With one guy supposedly making $100k from $40. https://mobile.twitter.com/KalleTrades/status/1647955160642236417/photo/1

But its not to late for you fellow degenrates as Mexc has listed PEPE and you can have fun trading it at 100x leverage!

However beware there is no functionality in the coin and all this is pure gambling. This could happen on the next be few days: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ft6WvNmagAApSiH?format=jpg&amp;name=large

Alt Coin Season Is Upon Us: Pepecoin reaches 42m 24 hour Vol in 2 Days.,"Alt Coin Season is upon us ladies and gentlemen.

Pepecoin is now the fastest growing alt coin in 2023. Reaching over 40m volume traded in just 48 24 hours, and reaching a market cap of over 20m.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/)

This post is not an endorsement to buy the coin. 

It's just super fun to see alt coin season making a come back, and a new meme coin coming into play. Can you do anything with it? No. 

Is the contract just a vanilla ERC20 contract? Yes.

Is this a completely worthless token? Probably.

NFA. Be careful. Do your DD.

Join Bobo in his journey to defeat Pepe the Frog (30m market cap),"Once upon a time, there were two cryptocurrencies named Bobo and Pepe. Pepe was an established coin with a market cap of 30 million, while Bobo was a newly launched coin that quickly rose to 500k in under an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Bobo was determined to become the Pepe killer and take over as the top cryptocurrency in the market. However, the coin faced setbacks when its developer disappeared after dumping his bags, leaving it on the verge of death.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the odds, the community rallied together and created a new Telegram group to revive the coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly but surely, Bobo began to regain its strength and make a name for itself in the crypto world.

&amp;#x200B;

With each step forward, Bobo became a more formidable opponent to Pepe. It was only a matter of time before Bobo became known as the Pepe killer, taking over as the top cryptocurrency in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, Bobo stands strong and proud, a testament to the power of community and determination. You can find Bobo at:

Don't chase shitcoins in the upcoming months," Hello fellow Redditors!

With the sentiment starting to be bullish again (we reached 69 on the Fear-and-Greed Index yesterday lol) the scams and shitcoins seem to be coming back again.

Today I saw somebody in a different sub shilling this ""new"" memecoin called pepe (like the frog meme) which promises to be the one memecoin to rule them all. It also promises to give an airdrop which should be absolutely huge like $ARB.

This so called ""memecoin killer"" is being shilled heavily by this Twitter account:

 The price is up over 300% just today and still rising as it seems.

With a sketchy looking website, no real tokenomics and a supply looking like a phone number this is probably a scam sooner or later. I mean even on the website it says the coin is completely useless.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics).

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

When meme coins and unknown sketchy projects start pumping like crazy it's good to exercise extreme caution.,"Currently several meme coins are trending and several of the meme coins that do absolutely nothing from the previous bullrun have also bubbled into the top 100 or floating near it. This is never a good sign, it means speculation is super high and that people are so confident they are betting on things that are worse than Safemoon and in some cases going all in.

Of course nobody can say what will happen next, but it's better to stick to your plan. With the economic forecast and consensus that we're pretty much headed for a recession (economic contraction); now would be the absolute worst time to be reckless and just yolo it all.

PEPE mooning + Meme coins - Exceed Caution,"
Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on the recent surge in popularity of meme coins, particularly PEPE. While it's exciting to see a coin go to the moon, it's important to exercise caution and do your due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency.

Meme coins like PEPE may seem fun and exciting, but they often lack the fundamentals that make a solid investment. They're typically created as a joke and don't have a real use case or value proposition. Instead, their value is largely driven by hype and speculation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't invest in meme coins if that's what you're into. Just be aware of the risks involved and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. And always remember to do your own research and make informed decisions.

So, if you're considering investing in PEPE or any other meme coin, make sure you understand what you're getting into. And remember, while it's fun to ride the hype train, it's important to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away by FOMO.",1,0,2023-04-19 12:39:05,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[(""I never thought I'd see shitcoins flying as fast as early 2023, but here we are\n\nThis might not be a good sign for the markets as well.

Moonshot small-cap coin - price analysis based on Market Cap multiples,"Today, I encountered a very interesting post about PEPE coin - a new coin that emerged a few days ago.

Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe\_mooning\_meme\_coins\_exceed\_caution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe_mooning_meme_coins_exceed_caution/)

Many people caught it early and made a multiple of their money.

In this post, I'll try to explain why you're most probably too late to do a 100000% return on it.

# Let's do some maths

The current market cap of PEPE is $100m as per: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/)

How much of a multiple can we expect?

Well, the largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $11b. I'll round it down to $10b.

So:

* If PEPE overtakes DOGE, it will do ""just"" a 100x. 
* If PEPE overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If PEPE reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, is it worth it to throw $100 right now? Maybe it's a bit late - it's highly unlikely that it will overtake DOGE, and even if it did, you'll have $10k - not nearly enough even for a lambo, not to even speak about retiring early. 

On the other hand, I think it's realistic for PEPE to reach $200m or $300m market cap, which will 2-3x your money.

If you want to gamble, be my guest.

But you're not retiring from this. 

Exercise caution and be careful. Once a coin is mentioned on this sub, it's already too late.

I am also invested in crypto around 2000 bucks which are always moving when Bitcoin is moving. Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =)\n&gt; \n&gt; # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin\n&gt; \n&gt; So as the title suggests it, the recent news from Ethereum switching from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. In this write up we are not going to talk about speculation  or the financial side of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment and if you want to read one, just go to past cointests.  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This won\'t be tackled at all as I think it deserves its own topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; # 1) Bitcoin: High security\n&gt; \n&gt; This topic has also been talked to death: Bitcoin is ultra secure  thanks to its Blockchain and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM:\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining.""  Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex  cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the  transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network. \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; [IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a  “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; [USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:%7E:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?""  \n&gt; [The hashrate is near the ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:%7E:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding  Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so.  \n&gt; While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.  \n&gt; Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the  hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now? \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; The Energy Fud Was Killed  \n&gt; The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  \n&gt; Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It  was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.  \n&gt; There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes. Bitcoin is a good piece of technology and I hope people continue to invest in it because it is doing a lot of good for our future !\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; #\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency [conceived in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) by a pseudonymous individual named [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi-nakamoto.asp). It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, despite its popularity and growing acceptance as a legitimate form of payment, there are several criticisms of Bitcoin that have been raised over the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Unclear Source of Value\n&gt; \n&gt; * Stocks derive their value from the underlying worth of a company and its assets. Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country\'s economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries.\n&gt; * Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory—all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.""\n&gt; * Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile.\n&gt;    * Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear.\n&gt; * Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose. (source: [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/))\n&gt;    * Without its utility being utilized, then, Bitcoin\'s value is significantly diminished.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Deepseated Stigma\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite its potential to revolutionize the financial industry, Bitcoin has faced significant resistance from mainstream institutions and individuals due to a variety of factors.\n&gt; \n&gt; * One of the main reasons for the stigma surrounding Bitcoin is its association with illegal activities. In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073)\n&gt; * Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value.\n&gt;    * Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices. Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile.\n&gt; * There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people. The underlying technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, and a ""decentralized network of network validators secured by a SHA-256 hashing algorithm"" is a novel concept that can be extremely difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with it. Yes, [98% of Americans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-comprehension-study-98-people-190349019.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCMe7hgrXllV_mlEw5tn7u-RoTKVu8UOYrfAhQHYKzUAGM48E4hQZFLRcL4GVt0esSNwGtDtWuNN8LD3ivbs2pcRmmXKpAAhCIw3ZGQQBTMTh4oR0X1OQSWD_jHYbNrgH2lOl0Wj-j6f59cNve0I7q_VF1bIqIqpbD9di-SF8yB) do not understand basic cryptocurrency concepts.\n&gt;    * This lack of understanding can lead to skepticism and distrust in the underlying technology, further contributing to the stigma surrounding Bitcoin.\n&gt; * Another factor is its lack of regulation - because Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside of the traditional financial system, it is not subject to the same level of regulation as fiat currencies.\n&gt;    * This lack of regulation has led to [concerns about its security](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/01/imf-warns-of-global-risks-from-unregulated-cryptocurrency-boom) and potential for fraud, further contributing to its negative reputation.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"It seems like the guy who turned $27 into $1,000,000 with PEPE is a serial shitcoin trader and he started with a very large amount of money to exclusively trade shitcoins.","He bought 2.52T PEPE worth around $1,000,000 now, with 0.013 ETH around $25 at the time, which made him a 32,000X profit.

He has traded 3,000+ shitcoins in the past 2+ years and probably realized around $2M in profit. Here are partially profitable tokens.

This guy bought MXS with 0.5 ETH in June 2021 and sold for 142.5 ETH in less than 30 mins.  Made a profit of 142 ETH ( 284x ).

Guys from Lookonchain noticed that he transferred in a total of 49,922 USDC and 677 ETH for trading, and transferred out 754,841 USDC and 1,167 ETH.  Currently holding 190 ETH.  So his realized profit is probably \~$2M (705K USDC and 680 ETH).

He basically throws shit at the wall and sees what will stick. He wasn't just 'lucky' like other people claimed over the last couple of days. He's just using a shotgun approach.

But it's also worth noting that he started with a large sum of money. Not everyone can afford to just throw nearly 50,000 USDC and 677 ETH into a meat grinder for shits and giggles and see what will stick.

Remember that next time you see another post about ""this X guy turned X amount into X millions"". His strategy paid off but it could also completely rekt his portfolio.

Edit: There's also some speculation on Twitter that he is an actual dev of this project and that's why he was able to buy early. Nobody else will be able to be so early, so it could be a Honeypot trap for other investors, and he will use them as exit liquidity but apart from a Honeypot Scan screenshot, I couldn't find more proof of that.

"Crypto Pragmatist: A bug, not a feature","**Jack Niewold**

***Founder,*** [***Crypto Pragmatist***](https://cryptopragmatist.com/)

April 20, 2023

About a week ago, I came across a new fundraising announcement today for a new crypto project. The project, led by a pseudonymous trader, had raised over $1m to build out a product based on what I think would be merely a feature in other industries. There’s no TAM, no true differentiator. ByBit or Binance could ship the same project as a small feature in a matter of weeks.

And, to be fair, even that million dollar round is relatively small as far DeFi goes. There are even crazier fundraising round for teams that I feel are building relatively simple features instead of companies and

And these founders and teams doing pretty well for themselves: paying teams of engineers salaries that would be unheard of in most countries, renting offices in the most expensive places in the world, buying themselves Macbook Pros and flying around the world to crypto conferences.

I’m not knocking that project itself; building and experimenting in crypto is important. This is just how the game works, and the VCs, founders, employees, angel investors, even retail investors. We’re all just playing the game.

**So what’s the problem?** Well, I’d argue that the problem is that the current paradigm in crypto is a great pressure for teams to create tokens over legitimately sustainable businesses.

And I think there’s a specific reason for this: **the whacky liquidity cycle in crypto.**

**​**

https://preview.redd.it/0qokd8dd45va1.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88bd2a5b85b873ecc00ff189a4e6051843346b64

Let me outline it here:

* It’s incredibly easy for teams to launch a token
* Investors want tokens they can speculate on more than actual products
* Tokens are more successful based on narrative than actual business success
* Teams and VCs focus on products that can launch a token over sustainable businesses
* Teams focus on tokens and tokenomics over products and business models
* Fewer sustainable projects and businesses get built in crypto

​  
​

**Crypto’s Dilemma**​  
​

Let’s say you’re a rational investor or builder: the average time for a company to IPO is 8 to 10 years. That’s a long time: Ethereum is barely 10 years old. But most major coins wouldn’t have made it: Uniswap is just five years old, Binance Coin and Chainlink are both about six years old. All of the above mentioned have hit a market cap of over $20b: about the size of Robinhood and Coinbase **combined**.

And what enables this superfast cycle of liquidity? Tokens: a way to create liquidity for project founders and investors without going through two things:  
​

* The rigor of having to show professional investors why you’re worth investing in
* The regulatory hurdles of going through an IPO

​

In many cases, a project can use a token launch not as a liquidity event, allowing for collective ownership of a valuable asset, but for fundraising: raising capital to build what will hopefully *someday* be a valuable asset.

From there, it becomes more important to build a desirable token than a desirable product. As a castle in the sky is worth more than something rooted in real world multiples and businesses, it’s sometimes better to just make vapor.

People are still here for 100x-es more than DeFi products; just look at the success of memecoins like Pepe, Aped, Wojak, and a whole host of others that have had their moment in the spotlight. You simply can’t make a memecoin in the TradFi industry, it’s impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

[PEPE is the fourth biggest coin by volume, according to DexScreener](https://preview.redd.it/hevthmmi45va1.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b1d3e4a4b3c0b8bfca73fcf71ecccbc6fd34b4f)

&amp;#x200B;

**This whole concept of a quick liquidity cycle is a bug, not a feature.** DeFi should strive to do better. I don’t know what the solution is. Perhaps there isn’t one: but if we want the DeFi and crypto industry to grow into a real, mature industry, with projects bringing value to millions (billions) of people, we need to figure out how to deliver products, not tokens, into the hands of users.

[NO MOONS] Why can’t we let the Crypto Degens be Crypto Degens?,"I've noticed a lot of backlash about the whole PEPE coin and the people who invest in it. I mean aren't we all here to make money? Shouldn't necessarily matter how we achieve that wether it's through simply by holding, DCA, Leveraging or going all in on some random memecoin.

At the end of the day ALL OF US are here to make money, and it shouldn't matter how we achieve those financial goals when it comes to crypto. I'II even go through the daily thread sometimes and constantly see nothing but a bunch bulls and yet, they're only being bullish in order to get upvotes and I know for a fact a lot of you will lie in order to get upvotes to accumulate MOONS.

I'll say it again, we are all here to make money, and it shouldn't matter how we achieve it when it comes to crypto. Let the degens be degens, just cause you hodle Bitcoin or Ethereum does not make you more superior than the degen meme investors.

"Crypto Banter, a YT channel with 621k subscribers, has been shilling PEPE all week - be careful out there.","YouTube channels are well known for using their followers as exit liquidity, and some of the best versed in this art form, are the crew of the YouTube series ""Crypto Banter"" , having shilled countless VC shitcoins before, throughout, and even after the previous bull market. 

https://preview.redd.it/3qj0sz44cbva1.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=955b9a8c736c0939a24184539d92dbb75cb6964e

This week, they have shamelessly shilled/mentioned PEPE coin several times to their over 1/2 a million followers, most likely causing countless noobs to invest in what could very well be a rug pull.

https://preview.redd.it/dy73pwv9cbva1.png?width=1271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0932dfd79ec3590bc19ee202cddbb7d083f595d0

Today, they hosted a panel - with the most notable guest being Raoul Paul, in which Ran Neuner, the host, name drops PEPE token several times, urging the participants to give their opinion. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM)

Fortunately, the guest in the bottom right had the sense to discourage investing in the token, saying it wasn't in her wheelhouse, and wouldn't be participating.

Throughout the week, they have shilled PEPE several other times - almost daily. I find this somewhat irresponsible.

Having such a large following, and noticing PEPE so early into it's run - it almost seems as though their shilling of the token was a paid endorsement of some sort, as it is very seldom they would mention such a skeptical meme coin like this.

Personally, I aped a little into this early in the week and have had some pretty incredible gains - I've now taken profit and left my initial to ride the wave of shit. By the time CB was shilling, it was already nearing a dump.

I love meme coins, but I have 2 bull runs of experience in playing with shit. Always gamble responsibly, and always DYOR.

It is at least curious to see people are still chasing the next meme coin, even though they know it's a bet, by far. I know we all want to hit the jackpot, but with all honesty 99.99% of those who do so are just lucky.

These shitcoins/memecoins are just scams that will only enrich the ""devs"". That being said, just be careful out there and, as always, only invest what you can afford to lose. Also try to put money on projects that are successfully around for longer, and not literally 2 days.

Recently we saw a brief meme coin pump. Leading the pump was $PEPE. Which is already down from ATH now. When $PEPE started gaining momentum other people wanted to capitalize on this so they made similar tokens that contained $Pepe in the name. 

One of those tokens was called Arbi Pepe.

What is the lesson here? STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN SHIT COINS. Simple... Also, there is a reason why people can't just 10x their money in a week. If it was easy everyone would be doing it already.  If you are up in these meme coins GET OUT NOW. You will get burned.

Let’s talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. 

Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

So let’s talk about **Doge V Shiba Inu**

*Utility*
Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. 

Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. 

Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. 

**On-Chain Data**

Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. 

Doge’s active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. 

This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. 


While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba’s price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Ping for verified users associated with payments: /u/atlos-io\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The first thing i noticed was suspiciously high amount of money ""ppl"" are throwing into 1 day old shitcoin. Other sus thing is that a number of transactions is multiple times higher than number of makers, also number of holders was sub 1k at that time. Ah right, and obvious periodical dumping. Funny thing is fake volume wasn't even frequent enough to cause changes of price in last hour.

Pepe is to crypto what GameStop was to Wall Street.,,2,0,2023-04-22 13:54:34,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,[]
THE REAL PEPE - potential web of scam coins,"hi guys, comments under my post about rug pull of PEPE and series of other rug pulls associated with the same wallet were saying that i spread missinfomation and it was not the real PEPE. Well they were right it was just a copycat, bit they gave me an idea to take a look at THE REAL PEPE and here is what i found.

first i took a look at top 5 holders

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xyog2ni3zgva1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff23c363b0c317efbe680415ca51ec3ed60e844

among 5 top holders there are 3 exchanges, top 5 wallets hold 15% of supply, i've seen worse for a shitcoin. so let's take a look at top holder first: 0x92fb5b4f8030103e0b11275c30965d1897ff23e5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mtpvmbjh1hva1.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1a2bf53d6c1291a570fad60f9d85dfe146652c

First wallet and already something interesting, whole portfolio is just PEPE and wallet was created 8 days ago, ok let's take a look at history of transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ahy3njbc2hva1.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70bac7fb27fa254913b3a111a28d1123a84b5cc

we can see a bunch of shitcoins, let's continue

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wagz2ddl2hva1.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5ee5da58a3318c3c622e455c031393c007923f

Do you remember that exchanges were among buggest holders of PEPE? just take a look how did pepe ended up in those exchanges wallets :)

here we have wallet that sent initial ETH here, let's take a look at 0xfbfeaf0da0f2fde5c66df570133ae35f3eb58c9a

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"During the past days we have seen how many shitcoins were pumping, but this also historically has represented the end of a Crypto rally.","The price action of the bigger Crypto assets like, BTC and ETH, has been mostly muted or heavily to the downside for the past days and even weeks, while some other Cryptos have been pumping as if we are in the middle of a bull market. I think we all have seen that happen with shitcoins like PEPE and also others like AIDOGE.

This kind of a pattern where shitcoins are pumping while BTC has already pumped and is now seemingly on the move down, has historically been seen as the end of a rally.

New Airdrop for ARB recipients: REKT,"This one isn’t worth a whole lot right now and was dropped this afternoon (5:00 PM UTC).

If you were fortunate enough to receive the ARB airdrop, your wallet address is eligible to receive the REKT airdrop.  I got about 800 ARB and the REKT drop netted me about 5 dollars.  However, given the success of the PEPE drop, we could get a decent multiplier with REKT.  That being said I would not spend anything other than the gas (about 50 cents in ETH) to claim REKT.  

There is no wallet checker so I would advise moving your moons to another address if that is the one that was used to claim the ARB airdrop and / or connecting a burner address to the website before checking your eligibility.

Contract address, website link and other info at the Tweet below. As always, DYOR and exercise caution before interacting with unknown websites.

Guys remember to do your research, for crypto noobs easy way is going to [https://dexscreener.com/](https://dexscreener.com/) and finding the coin you want, from there you can find info like latest transactions, top holders, volume etc. lets's take for example take a look at GENSLR -  0xE2dcd7Fec3633987F0679086c9242138e5A23C7E

in short we can see:

\-huge volume

\-created less than 24h ago

\-had a huge pump

\-number of transactions is a lot higher than number of makers

\-sells/buys are berry close to each other

when you scroll down you can find distrubution of coins among top holders:

Meme Token Pepe (PEPE) Shows 40% Increase After 60% Plunge,,1,0,2023-04-23 09:56:57,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]
Bear Market Reminder: Beware of Investing in Meme Coins and Shady Projects like $PEPE - Do Your Research!,"As we navigate through a bear market in the cryptocurrency world, it's important to remind ourselves of the risks associated with investing in meme coins and shady projects like $PEPE.

During times of uncertainty, it can be tempting to seek out quick gains and overlook warning signs. However, it's crucial to exercise caution and do thorough research before investing your hard-earned money.

Many meme coins and questionable projects have been used as cover-ups for scams, where investors lose their funds. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it's essential to research the project team, their track record, and the project's potential before investing.

Remember, cryptocurrency investing is highly speculative, and there are no guarantees of profits. Don't be fooled by promises of high returns with minimal effort, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

In short, as we weather this bear market, let's remember to take a cautious approach to investing in $PEPE or any other meme coins or questionable projects.

BABYPEPE rugged yesterday and I'm sure that more will continue to rug. Even in a bear market, where arguably the only thing you need to do to have decent profits a bit further down the line is DCA into real assets, people are still looking for a get rich quick scheme.

No matter how good the opportunity is (and I believe the current market will make a lot of people well off in a matter of years) people's greed demands instant x100 profits. Regulation will have to happen because scammers and idiots are just too busy getting in business together all the time.

Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections.

I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated.

I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space.

I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future.

I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho  but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm.

These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. 

Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget.

Pepe will end up like Grumpy Cat for the same reason..,"If you don't know the story of Grumpy Cat, it was a super hot shitcoin last bull run. It's claim to fame of course was that it was built on a solid meme that stood the test of time.  Whenever you bought or traded grumpy it set some aside to be donated to animals iirc. Shit was absolutely chuggin along. 

But it turns out that grumpy cat was a registered trademark. And the owner of grumpy cat sent a cease and desist to the CEXs that were carrying it. They dropped it. CMC dropped it. Then it was rugged. And the community scrambled for anything to recover their bags. Several factions split off including the noble PAWTH, a bunch of discord drama blah blah and nobody made anything back. 

Now you may be familiar with the controversy over the pepe meme. A bunch 4chan knuckle draggers turned it into a hate symbol to own the libs or something in 2016. What you may not know though is that as a response the creator trademarked it. And sued several people for its use including the daily stormer and infowars. A pepe game was rejected from the apple store even based upon it being a hate symbol. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog

Needless to say it's pretty easy to see where this is all going.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics).

And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Pepe meme coin down over 16%,"The cryptocurrency market has recently been rocked by the sudden and dramatic drop of the popular Pepe Meme Coin (PEPE). The digital currency, inspired by the well-known internet meme character, has plummeted by nearly 20% overnight, leaving investors and market analysts scrambling to make sense of the rapid decline. The sudden drop in the value of Pepe Meme Coin has raised suspicions of a rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation. This article will examine these factors and discuss their potential impact on the future of PEPE and other meme coins.

Rug Pull
A rug pull is a type of exit scam in the cryptocurrency world where developers or project owners abruptly withdraw their funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. The rapid decline of Pepe Meme Coin's value has led to speculation that a rug pull could be responsible for the sudden drop. While it is challenging to determine whether a rug pull has occurred, investors should be cautious when investing in newer and lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as they may be more susceptible to exit scams.

Bot-Pumping on r/cryptocurrency
Another factor potentially contributing to the sudden decline in PEPE's value is the recent bot-pumping on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. In the past week, numerous bot accounts have been promoting Pepe Meme Coin, artificially inflating the perceived popularity and value of the digital asset. This coordinated effort to manipulate market sentiment can lead to unsustainable price increases, followed by a rapid decline when the manipulation is exposed or comes to an end. It is crucial for investors to be aware of such deceptive practices and to thoroughly research any cryptocurrency they are considering investing in.

Market Manipulation
The cryptocurrency market, particularly for smaller and less established tokens like Pepe Meme Coin, remains susceptible to price manipulation by large investors or ""whales."" These entities can use their substantial holdings to artificially inflate or deflate the price of a digital asset, often to their own advantage. The suddenness and severity of PEPE's drop in value raise suspicions of market manipulation. Investors should remain vigilant about the potential for manipulation in the cryptocurrency market and carefully consider the risks associated with investing in less established digital assets.

Conclusion

The dramatic overnight drop in Pepe Meme Coin's value serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, especially those based on memes or other ephemeral internet phenomena. The suspected rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation highlight the need for investors to stay informed, conduct thorough research, and approach the market with caution.

While the future of Pepe Meme Coin and other meme-based cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the world of digital assets is as unpredictable as ever. As such, investors should be prepared for unexpected shifts in value and exercise caution when investing in lesser-known tokens.",1,1,2023-04-24 07:19:59,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Hello sleepnsquad.

* The maximum token trading amount or maximum position can be modified, which may lead to suspension of trading;
* The blacklist function is included. Some addresses may not be able to trade normally.

Dynamic NFTs – The Next Bullrun Hype?,"Are Dynamic NFTs the next Cryptohype or is it just a niche that is not taken into ac-count?

Is it worth to invest now in the first Dynamic NFTs?

&amp;#x200B;

# So first lets take a look what are Dynamic NFTs

Dynamic NFTs are non-fungible tokens whose metadata and visual representation can change under certain circumstances, while static NFTs are immutable and retain their visual and content characteristics regardless of who owns them or how often they are traded.

# How a dynamic NFT works

Dynamic NFTs operate on the basis of smart contracts created on a blockchain plat-form, such as Ethereum. These smart contracts are programmable contracts that are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. **In the case of dynamic NFTs, these conditions are often associated with the modification of visual or content characteristics of the NFT.**

**Some examples of practical use cases of dynamic NFTs are:**

**1.** NFTs that change based on real-time data, such as weather, stock prices, or social networks.

**2.** Collectible cards or blockchain gaming items that can be upgraded or customized over time.

**3.** Digital pets or avatars that respond to their owners' interactions and evolve ac-cordingly.

**4.** NFTs that serve as access tokens to exclusive content or events and whose design

changes according to the number of events attended.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, dynamic NFTs can thus provide a more engaging and personalizable experience

for users by providing unique and changing content that can respond to its owners

and its environment.

# What Crypto Projects Already Using Dynamic NFTs?

**Adidas:**

Adidas is one of the most well-known companies that has one of the largest NFT projects,

the Adidas ALTS NFT collection, which has dynamic properties. Adidas ALTS

NFTs serve as digital identities and avatars for their owners within the Adidas metaverse.

They provide access to exclusive content, events and benefits that are only

available to holders of these NFTs.

[https://opensea.io/collection/alts-by-adidas](https://opensea.io/collection/alts-by-adidas)

&amp;#x200B;

**Polymorphs**

Polymorphs is another project that features its unique feature scrambling system and

works with NFTs with dynamic properties. The Polymorphs NFT collection consists of

constantly changing NFTs that can be altered in different ways by their owners. Owners

can remix the DNA of their Polymorphs NFT to change its appearance, including

clothing and wearable items.

[https://opensea.io/collection/polymorphs](https://opensea.io/collection/polymorphs)

&amp;#x200B;

**Moonbirds**

Moonbirds introduced a dynamic in December 2022 by allowing collectors to activate

new backgrounds. This aesthetic is stored in the Moonbirds Smart Contract, so any

updates or additions happen directly on the blockchain.

[https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pepethereum**

Pepethereum presents dynamic „On-Chain-Pepes“ that interact with the Ethereum

network. These NFTs automatically adjust Pepes smile to the ETH price by tracking

Uniswap pool data directly from the blockchain.

Unique traits

No two frogs are the same. The pastel shades of each trait are created by hashing

the trait id and token id then converting the hash to an hsl color code.

Note that this is not associated with the official Pepe. This is a eth/usdc price indicator

that is paying homage to the popular meme in a unique way.

[https://pepethereum.com/](https://pepethereum.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Static NFTs, which guarantee that an NFT will have the same properties forever, are

interesting because of their immutability and valuable to many collectors for that very

reason. Nevertheless, it seems likely that more and more dynamic NFTs will come

onto the market in the future, as they can fundamentally extend the functions of

NFTs. Especially for brands that want to create personalized user experiences for

their customers, dynamic NFTs offer significantly more design possibilities than static

ones. It will be exciting to see how today's pioneers in this sector experiment with dynamic

NFTs in the coming months. Especially in the blockchain gaming sector, dynamic

NFTS are likely to play an increasingly important role.",1,0,2023-04-25 12:35:07,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('Are Reddit avatars then dynamic NFTs aswell?', 1), ('I think they would be right?

Memecoin Mania Subsides As Dogecoin and PEPE Experience Declines.,,1,1,2023-04-25 16:47:20,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('Hello, your post was removed because your account is less than 60 days old or you do not have the required 500 **comment** karma to make post submissions.', 1)]"
Floki Inu’s Listing Skyrockets Price,"
After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048.


The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday.

The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm.

Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings.

FLOKI’s listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US’ large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project’s next goal.
After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project’s team and backers. The coin’s market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,"[('50% up after the listing', 1), ('As usual listing on big exchanges results in pumps .

Poor folks getting rich in crypto? Myth vs. reality possibility vs. probability?,"We’ve all heard the Otis Spunkmire story about those delicious cookies that took Otis from homelessness and poverty to a wealthy household name and the story of the American dream.  The tales of sudden  

Bitcoin millionaires and lost treasures in long forgotten wallets flood the crypto ethos like urban legends and bring new blood, and new funds to the space daily.  Like miners panning for gold people from all walks of life flood the crypto space and provide fuel for market and make great targets for the well equipped scammer and the next rug pull. 

Like walking into a casino after having  read one book on how to play poker, then getting eyes drawn to the new high tech slot machines individuals are quickly reminded of P.T. Barnum’s quote, “there’s a sucker born every minute,” as they attempt to explain to their families where the Christmas bonus went. 

Dejected and dismayed they vow unwittingly to get the money back and then some. After all they’ve heard Pepe is the new Doge and the old Doge is about to do it again. All they need to do is swap they current bags and Hodl and in time they’ll moon,  right? Or at least that’s what the latest YouTube guru says as they point out “life changing gains.” 

Is it real? I’m of the belief that 90% or more of the recognized “outliers” have had way more going for them besides a dollar and a dream. Things like exposure to market, ability to read charts, above average financial literacy and a decent financial cushion certainly have allot to do with so called “overnight successes.” Rags to riches stories are enticing however. How many have hodled while they watched their dream come true then crash into oblivion? Sucked in by community hype and under the illusion that the superior tech was going to take their coin to the next level those who don’t know what volatility really means are destined to find out.
There’s a learning curve to anything worthwhile. Education is rarely free. It demands to be paid for one way or the other. Exchange fees, transfer fees, gas fees, transaction, fees, and taxes take the poor man for a ride, and by the time all is said, and done how much better off were they?

I've seen this many, many times. I can't fathom why someone would trade ten bucks for less than a nickel. At first, I get it. That dime is burning a hole in your pocket, why not yolo it into a shitcoin and see if it becomes a cool billion bucks? So you fork over that silver Roosevelt plus a pair of Lincoln's because it's Eth. After what feels like an eternity, but in reality is only 2 hours, you realize your investment has now plummeting, and you have 4/5ths of a nickel. So you fork over another couple Lincoln's and boom, you are free of your shitcoins *and* 0.01 Eth.

This makes zero sense to me. You have to confirm the transaction. Whose looking at that gas fee and thinking ""YES, PLEASE, I would rather be -$10 than +.04""? No one out there is harvesting a sub-one dollar tax loss. There is no reason that this kind of trade should ever take place.

Creating A Meme Coin: Jerry Springer Pepe,"As an exercise in understanding crypto more, I was thinking about building a meme coin. Of course, the important thing is to have a strong coin name.  But I am wondering if others believe there are essentially ""rules"" to building a cussessful meme coin. Here is my list of important steps and essential components,  as I've determined them from projects and coins I've been in over the recent years:

- Recognizable name. This is obvious. You need something people can quickly refer to that people will be interested in.

- Tokenomics. I know that coins with any kind tokenomics have fallen quickly out of favor these last 18 months. Wondering if there are any new thoughts on the best way to manage token economics now beyond the obvious tax/no tax models.

- Blockchains. A huge ton of meme coins launched on BNB mostly because their gas fees are so low. But of course, a ton of meme coins exist on ETH chain as well with their higher gas fees. I am wondering if it is time to think about starting mem coins on other, perhaps newer chains. Ideas?

- Launch and Funding- I have seen a lot of newer mechanisms for coin luanches now. Lots of launchpads and more. What is the best thoughts on perhaps launching a meme coin without the need to consider doing lots of development based on functionality.

Once upon a time in crypto land.... (part 1 - intro),"There was a little guy named pepe.  He saw bitcoin crash and thought ""wow, that looks cheap, it'll go down more""

He waited and waited, but nothing happened.  Perplexed he went about his daily business until one day, he checked his binance app and low and behold, bitcoin had risen in price.

""It can't be, it'll definitely go down more, it's just a blip""

Sure enough a few more days passed and he checked again.  It had gone up again!

""Fark"" he said. ""I could have got that really cheap.  It was 15k when I thought it would go down more, and now it's 28k! I could have doubled my money!""

He decided to wait again, sure that bitcoin would eventually resume it's downtrend.

A few months passed.  He'd been busy so hadn't been looking at the price much or really paying attention to it.  One day he woke up early and remembered that bitcoin was supposed to drop like he thought.  

He got excited! It had been a couple of months, ""it must be in the toilet now he thought.  I'm going to buy cheap bitcoin and be rich!""

He reached over to his bedside table and grabbed his phone and pulled up a weekly bitcoin usd chart on binance.  The dollar had started to weaken, and btc had started a huge run.  He looked at the price at the top of his screen.

""100,000 usd per BTC""

""I knew this day would come!""

Unforgettable moments in Bitcoin history: 8 legendary Tweets,"I would like to present you 8 legendary Bitcoin tweets - a blast from the past. Enjoy it folks!

&amp;#x200B;

**(1)** Let's start with a real banger! Our boi Greg bought 1700 BTC @ 6 Cents and sold em for 30 Cents. We can't blame him - profits are profits.

&amp;#x200B;

[\(1\)](https://preview.redd.it/umaimmqu1pwa1.jpg?width=1065&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=84133921441c11fa357635b0c8d8edf75a7fa0e1)

&amp;#x200B;

**(2)** Christian generated 100 Bitcoins in August 2010. He asks: Am I rich yet? Well, let's do the math here ...

100 BTC x  29.352,73 USD = **2.935.273** USD 

So the answer is =&gt; if u hold Christian, yes, u are rich :) I hope u did!

[\(2\)](https://preview.redd.it/8ohykwbn2pwa1.jpg?width=1011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=41d623d2c6665313e3e8ac651d51c8d0944ae8ed)

&amp;#x200B;

**(3)** Let's discuss an interesting poll. Will BTC reach 1000 USD before 2017? The majority said NO and they were right. BTC did not reach 1k before 2017. On 31. dec 2016 BTC was at 966 USD (very close). Just 4 days later BTC hit 1130 USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

[\(3\)](https://preview.redd.it/4xtf9xti3pwa1.jpg?width=537&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7bd8433cf0f3be71214808c4ac92808dcef8a2aa)

&amp;#x200B;

**(4)** The satisfaction of selling BTC captured in one single tweet.

[\(4\)](https://preview.redd.it/3j8k887i4pwa1.jpg?width=552&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f580ebdec9e9d37dfa70526df4f2d71194f8fcf)

**(5)** One of my personal favorites: \*\*Economy is real\*\* Love it!

&amp;#x200B;

[\(5\)](https://preview.redd.it/qeecwaz95pwa1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=db39a7306d72eea677738efe5735cd43744b503c)

&amp;#x200B;

**(6)** Andrew sold 100 BTC for 12 bucks in 2012 (they gained momentum after he sold). 

[\(6\)](https://preview.redd.it/9spv3ugl5pwa1.jpg?width=559&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49dde2b1ba09378d0882b40f5f0244af86177db0)

&amp;#x200B;

**(7)** 360% return is more than solid, so why not buying a kindle with the gains ;-) Pepe was kinda mean though ...

[\(7\)](https://preview.redd.it/4v2ewzj46pwa1.jpg?width=970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0da3b8d95c1be01ccf70b0b5b3c58b6c6621efc0)

&amp;#x200B;

**(8)** Someone bought 120k USD worth of Bitcoin at 12 bucks ... the question is: Who was it? :)

[\(8\)](https://preview.redd.it/zfd6l2wj6pwa1.jpg?width=546&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c3bb75c351963bf97df79ca142c538e5e932617e)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, you want a bonus round, u will get a bonus round :D 

Ichi missed the bus (sad face), he only generated 600 BTC but the good thing is, he will be buying more. Ichi, you are the boss man!!!

You hear about how PEPE coin made a kid $1 Million with their $27 Investment but you don't hear about people losing lifesaving in others Everyday,"Recently I'm seeing this PEPE coin  trend all over the Internet, even on this sub I've seen a overflow of pepe coin posts past 2 weeks, media is also posting so many articles all day long about this coin which is making many people fomo in and lose money. 

I know it's very tempting when you hear about some shitcoins pumping 10x in a week all over social media and news sites but MOST of the time it's already too late to invest, so many news sites get paid to post about these shitcoins to lure more people in, devs and whales spend alot of money on hyping these projects. People fomo in and invest big in these projects meanwhile devs and early investors keep dumping on you with so many private wallets they bought from early on. 

There are the people who would join crypto, gamble away money on these hyped up shitcoins, lose money and then go cry outloud on the streets that crypto is a scam.Don't be those guys.


Now I'm not saying all the shitcoins have bad devs or intentions but  this is the case with 99.99% shitcoins. 

Media don't report on how many rugpulls happens everyday in this space, so many people lose shitload of money every single day in shitcoin world but most of those are not reported by media. 

This post isn't against any particular meme or shitcoin, it's only to warn my fellow CC sub family not to fomo in shitcoins because of all the hype and be very cautious.

Think of shitcoins as a lottery ticket, your chances of winning it are very low, it's pure gamble, your investment can go to 0 instead of going to the moon.

Unforgettable moments in Bitcoin history: 8 legendary Tweets,"I would like to present you 8 legendary Bitcoin tweets - a blast from the past. Enjoy it folks! 

Edit: I posted this post yesterday, but it was deleted due to the 'Topic Limits', so I try it again (the BTC limit is 8/12 at the moment).

**(1)** Let's start with a real banger! Our boi Greg bought 1700 BTC @ 6 Cents and sold em for 30 Cents. We can't blame him - profits are profits.

&amp;#x200B;

[\(1\)](https://preview.redd.it/o7fqkmjqhvwa1.jpg?width=1065&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d775139776ddc9c1da24673f54a7ebf35bcbd94)

&amp;#x200B;

**(2)** Christian generated 100 Bitcoins in August 2010. He asks: Am I rich yet? Well, let's do the math here ...

100 BTC x 29.210,00 $ USD =  **2.921.000 USD**

So the answer is =&gt; if u hold Christian, yes, u are rich :) I hope u did!

&amp;#x200B;

[\(2\)](https://preview.redd.it/kt2r41hfjvwa1.jpg?width=1011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb9b0e3fd84cbfc9d57fca85066b36d1490c163)

&amp;#x200B;

**(3)** Let's discuss an interesting poll. Will BTC reach 1000 USD before 2017? The majority said NO and they were right. BTC did not reach 1k before 2017. On 31. dec 2016 BTC was at 966 USD (very close). Just 4 days later BTC hit 1130 USD.

&amp;#x200B;

[\(3\)](https://preview.redd.it/95wjtnwuhvwa1.jpg?width=537&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db2fec75b10e08c641f6721381f0e5eff1f06db)

&amp;#x200B;

**(4)** **The satisfaction of selling BTC** (captured in one single tweet)

&amp;#x200B;

[\(4\)](https://preview.redd.it/pl7xgmiwhvwa1.jpg?width=552&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d54e59fb22e567a05d2284d890912b3061493a52)

&amp;#x200B;

**(5)** One of my personal favorites: **Economy is real.** Love it!

&amp;#x200B;

[\(5\)](https://preview.redd.it/yfgh41zxhvwa1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c5e2ba132099e4c6abb1d3aa6cf9801b36e20d)

&amp;#x200B;

**(6)** Andrew sold 100 BTC for 12 bucks in 2012 (they gained momentum after he sold).

&amp;#x200B;

[\(6\)](https://preview.redd.it/u4rdmuqzhvwa1.jpg?width=559&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ddfdeb2d5a0dba00967c13de9f53da9716f330e)

&amp;#x200B;

**(7)** 360% return is more than solid, so why not buying a kindle with the gains ;-) Pepe was kinda mean though ...

&amp;#x200B;

[\(7\)](https://preview.redd.it/w61tvhq1ivwa1.jpg?width=970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b04dce1052bb225ff24d44d3dfd4c283362b8f)

&amp;#x200B;

**(8)** Someone bought 120k USD worth of Bitcoin at 12 bucks ... the question is: *Who was it?* :)

&amp;#x200B;

[\(8\)](https://preview.redd.it/pakgfte3ivwa1.jpg?width=546&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e36483a5c3429e30ca7af350c425437bcf00d7df)

Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =)\n&gt; \n&gt; # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin\n&gt; \n&gt; So as the title suggests it, the recent news from Ethereum switching from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. In this write up we are not going to talk about speculation  or the financial side of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment and if you want to read one, just go to past cointests.  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This won\'t be tackled at all as I think it deserves its own topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; # 1) Bitcoin: High security\n&gt; \n&gt; This topic has also been talked to death: Bitcoin is ultra secure  thanks to its Blockchain and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM:\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining.""  Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex  cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the  transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network. \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; [IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a  “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; [USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:%7E:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?""  \n&gt; [The hashrate is near the ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:%7E:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding  Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so.  \n&gt; While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.  \n&gt; Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the  hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now? \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; The Energy Fud Was Killed  \n&gt; The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  \n&gt; Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It  was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.  \n&gt; There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes.

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency [conceived in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) by a pseudonymous individual named [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi-nakamoto.asp). It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, despite its popularity and growing acceptance as a legitimate form of payment, there are several criticisms of Bitcoin that have been raised over the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Unclear Source of Value\n&gt; \n&gt; * Stocks derive their value from the underlying worth of a company and its assets. Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country\'s economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries.\n&gt; * Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory—all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.""\n&gt; * Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile.\n&gt;    * Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear.\n&gt; * Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose. (source: [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/))\n&gt;    * Without its utility being utilized, then, Bitcoin\'s value is significantly diminished.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Deepseated Stigma\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite its potential to revolutionize the financial industry, Bitcoin has faced significant resistance from mainstream institutions and individuals due to a variety of factors.\n&gt; \n&gt; * One of the main reasons for the stigma surrounding Bitcoin is its association with illegal activities. In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073)\n&gt; * Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value.\n&gt;    * Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices. Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile.\n&gt; * There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people. The underlying technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, and a ""decentralized network of network validators secured by a SHA-256 hashing algorithm"" is a novel concept that can be extremely difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with it. Yes, [98% of Americans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-comprehension-study-98-people-190349019.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCMe7hgrXllV_mlEw5tn7u-RoTKVu8UOYrfAhQHYKzUAGM48E4hQZFLRcL4GVt0esSNwGtDtWuNN8LD3ivbs2pcRmmXKpAAhCIw3ZGQQBTMTh4oR0X1OQSWD_jHYbNrgH2lOl0Wj-j6f59cNve0I7q_VF1bIqIqpbD9di-SF8yB) do not understand basic cryptocurrency concepts.\n&gt;    * This lack of understanding can lead to skepticism and distrust in the underlying technology, further contributing to the stigma surrounding Bitcoin.\n&gt; * Another factor is its lack of regulation - because Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside of the traditional financial system, it is not subject to the same level of regulation as fiat currencies.\n&gt;    * This lack of regulation has led to [concerns about its security](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/01/imf-warns-of-global-risks-from-unregulated-cryptocurrency-boom) and potential for fraud, further contributing to its negative reputation.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Pepe (PEPE) Surpasses Shiba Inu (SHIB) in Trading Volume,,1,0,2023-04-30 21:04:20,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL,[]
"This Pepe Whale Sold 14% of PEPE Supply, Smart Investor Or Ties to Development"," 

A ""mysterious"" PEPE whale was found to have sold a significant portion of the token's supply. The individual has sold approximately 800 billion PEPE tokens, which equates to 14% of the entire PEPE supply. This has led to speculation that the whale in question could potentially be a developer involved with the project.

According to data gathered by Lookonchain, the Pepe whale has been strategically selling off their tokens whenever the price of PEPE increases. Just recently, the individual sold 100 billion PEPE tokens for 21 ETH (equivalent to $40,000) at a price of $0.0000004007 per token.

&amp;#x200B;

[On chain Analyst Lookonchain](https://preview.redd.it/f6dpoaymk3xa1.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c867fcd4d6700f6c37abffefc8265f57965990)

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the mysterious seller has accumulated 117 ETH (worth approximately $221,500) from their token sales, with an average selling price of $0.0000002744 per PEPE.

The fact that this whale has been systematically offloading their tokens has fueled speculations that they could be a developer or someone closely associated with the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it is possible that the mysterious Pepe whale is simply an investor with a large holding who is taking advantage of price movements to maximize their profits.

The whale's wallet ENS is dimethyltryptamine.eth, apparently [@rodeorambler](https://twitter.com/rodeorambler) who has since deleted their twitter and started selling PEPE. There really isn't much known about him/her besides an affiliation with Milad Maker NFTs.

His etherscan is interesting if you trace it's orgin, thousands and thousands of ETH washed through hundreds of wallets dating back to 2017.

Am I wrong if I have zero empathy for people who invest in PEPE and lose money?,"I honestly have zero empathy for people who invest in PEPE and lose money. I don't feel sorry for them at all. It is a shitcoin. I would say that anyone who invested in PEPE before it blew up is greedy. There are people who invested some spare change in it and did good.

Coins like this one, in my opinion, have bad impact on crypto.

New people join, get scammed, think crypto is a scam, stop investing in crypto.

Phase 3 - Pepe merch and Pepe academy?

It is a memecoin.

Be happy for people who made money off sh*tcoins. We all have different styles and strategies,"Im one of those people that follows CT pretty closely, it really is a cesspool (like all aspects of twitter) but you do find good alpha there and some nice gems of insight. Youll see people with 8 figure net worth posting about anime and frog pictures saying “4” ad nauseam engaging with all sorts of people, sharing their disdain of the traditional system with the rest of us. This is how i came across $PEPE several days ago, but opted not to invest because like many of you im not into “shitcoins”. Im sure many of you have had a similar experience with PEPE or Queen Elizabeth Inu or SHIB or Mongoosecoin etc.

Seeing these giant green candles i said “its okay itll dump”. It didnt. Sidelined watching its market cap go from 20M to 300M. I know its money i never had therefore money never lost, but sad to watch the ship set sail and then i came across this tweet:

&gt; its ok if you dont wanna touch it because it doesnt suit your timeframe preference or style but realize ""its gonna go to zero eventually"" talk is exactly what tardfi ppl say about crypto, ppl getting rich on not-your-bags is not a threat to your profitability or your self worth.

We often say X is a shitcoin and its doomed to fail, but theres not really any benefit to you. Whether its copium or tribalism or some weird superiority complex we should want everyone to succeed. It can be PEPE or SOL or Reddit Avatars (dont you dare) but at some point we’ve all done it.

Im guilty of this too and in the future will try to be more constructive with my opinions. Im sure some of you are thinking “what a shit take think of the people who lost it all” and you’re right, but we know the risks of dumping everything we own into a frog coin. We should warn people of obvious scams, but dont hate on something because it made someone else money or its simply not your cuppa.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention.

This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities.

"PEPE Security analysis using GPT4 - Unlimited token minting, user blacklisting, DDoS risk","I used GPT4 to analyze the PEPE token contract.

Here is a security analysis of the given PepeToken contract:  


**Function visibility and access control:**  


The contract is properly making use of the onlyOwner modifier for functions that need owner access control.
Additionally, the Ownable contract is imported, which manages the ownership of the contract.


**Reentrancy risk:**  


The token contract does not seem to have any reentrancy risk, as it does not call external contracts in a way that allows reentrancy.
Safe arithmetic operations:

The contract is using Solidity version 0.8, which has built-in overflow and underflow checks. This reduces the likelihood of arithmetic errors.  


**DOS (Denial of Service):**  


While the contract uses the _beforeTokenTransfer() hook as necessary, it may allow a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker could create a large number of addresses and add them to the blacklist, which would slow down transactions and potentially prevent legitimate users from using the contract.

To minimize this risk, consider limiting the number of addresses that can be added to the blacklist and/or implementing a mechanism for removing addresses from the blacklist.  


**ERC20 standard compliance:** 


The contract seems to comply with the ERC20 standard, implementing the necessary functions, events, and using the OpenZeppelin library in general, which is well-reviewed and secure.  


**Supply control:**  


The contract allows the owner to mint tokens, but does not include a mechanism for pausing or stopping token minting, which may pose a risk of excessive token supply.  


**Use of blacklist:**  


The contract includes a blacklist feature, which restricts certain addresses from sending or receiving tokens.

This could be seen as a centralized mechanism, which may not align with the principles of decentralization. Consider explaining the reasoning behind this feature, and make sure it is used transparently and responsibly.  


**Custom rules and token transfer limits:**  


The contract includes the setRule function to modify transfer limits and enforce custom rules. This feature can be used by the contract owner to manage the maximum and minimum token holdings for addresses.
While this allows for flexibility and control, it can be seen as a centralization point for the owner. Make sure to properly document the use cases and inform users about this feature to avoid any misunderstandings.

"PEPE Meme Coin Skyrockets 39,000%: Binance Listing Next? Or Just a Rug Pull Waiting to Happen?"," 

Hold on to your memes, folks! PEPE meme coin has just hit a jaw-dropping all-time high of $0.000000816, marking a staggering 38,900% increase since its launch on April 14th. This meteoric rise has propelled PEPE into the top 125 coins by market cap.

But let's take a step back and ask ourselves: why do people keep buying potential rug pulls like PEPE? The liquidity of this coin is 65 times less than its market cap, and a huge portion of the coin is held by just a few wallets. Yet, people still freaking buy it!.

What's more, PEPE's 24-hour trading volume has ranked it as the 17th most traded cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. With a market cap of over $326 million in less than two weeks, PEPE is quickly closing in on fellow meme coin Floki (FLOKI). 💨

A recent Binance buyers guide has fueled speculation that the major exchange could list PEPE soon. Remember when Floki Inu's price spiked by 50% after being listed on Binance? Imagine the possibilities for PEPE! Or is it just another rug pull waiting to happen? 

Of course, investing in meme coins comes with its risks, as their prices are tied to online buzz and can be vulnerable to manipulation. 🌪️ But for now, PEPE has captured the internet's imagination and is setting its sights on the top 100. 

So, will PEPE join the ranks of meme tokens that remain permanently etched in the crypto world's consciousness? Or will it end up being another cautionary tale of a rug pull ? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: this little green frog has come a long way since its creation by Matt Furie in 2005. 🐸

Stay tuned, and let's see where this meme-tastic journey takes us next!  And remember, always do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency.

Accidentally swapped to wrong PEPE,"I'm a fucking noob and hate myself right now.
Swapped about 7.2k ETH into PEPE in my Coinbase wallet, but I'm pretty sure I swapped for the wrong PEPE and got a scam crypto instead because I only received 22
PEPE which is worth $600.

As you can see there are several PEPE icons in the Coinbase wallet and they come up with different swap exchange rates. I should have confirmed the rate but I didn't like a dumbass.

How can I validate the address of the correct PEPE I want to swap to on my Coinbase wallet and where can I find this address?

I should have just not used my dumbass Coinbase wallet and used a meta mask instead I'm assuming.

To Rugpull or not to Rugpull.,"First thing is there's too many shitcoins. Looking to select one that won't be a scam is a needle in a haystack. Even the scammiest of scam coins has a decent enough white paper. The only thing I can think of is that the potential for profit is exceedingly higher on a valid coin than that of a rugpull coin. Sure, you may make a decent amount on the coin you wish to release but you'd have a lot of people hating you as well as potential law suits that could make it worse. On the other side, from what we see from new meme coins like PEPE, the potential to be part of something amazing as well as profitable should be well worth the risk to do it right. So, make a small sum, or make a legacy and actually contribute to this wonderful world of Crypto. 

Maybe require an extensive KYC on the creator and team before a coin could be created?

Have a limit of the amount of cryptos to be released per month? I hope that'd make it more competitive and cause more hurdles hopefully which could prevent scams.

Have someone with extensive knowledge or a board of such people (like Vitalik) review before allowing the coin to continue?

I want to make this a safer place, we can't get there if there's no trust. You fellow redditor's likely know more than me, I'm pretty green. Let's help make this technology better.

"Rebutting the Argument, Moons will Never be in the top 100.","I'm posting this as a rebuttal to a popular post from four days ago, [""Why Moons will never be Top100""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12zz03g/why_moons_will_never_be_top100/). In that post Op made five arguments for why Moons would never be in the top 100, although some arguments have merit most others are bad faith arguments with no merit or validity.

# Quick Reminder on Moons

Op reminds everyone that Reddit has a stance Moons don't have value. Op acknowledges this is a legal argument from Reddit. Nothing else to add to this section.

# Not your everyday sh*tcoin

Ops states Moons won't pump because they aren't your everyday sh\*tcoin and doesn't have any marketing.

This argument ignores the fact it's probably one of the best known tokens of this SubReddit. Moon development is completely community driven, members of this community have 163 ETH in Liquidity and 1.435M Moons on SushiSwap liquidity. One of the best things about Dogecoin is the community that wanted to build and promote it. Moons have what many sh\*t coins wish they had, a community that wants to see it develop.

**So no it's not your average sh\*tcoin where people play the greater fool hoping to pump and not be burned. It's actually being developed in a grassroots way.**

# No one cares

Op states since there are over 6M members of this sub and only 200k Moon holders  (3%) it's proof that no one cares about Moons. Again this is another bad faith argument, a subscriber just means an account that subscribed to a community, it doesn't take into consideration account activity on Reddit. Many of those accounts could be banned bots or old accounts that haven't signed into Reddit for years.

200K Moon Holders is a ton of people. Sh\*tcoins like Pepe dream of ever reaching 10K holders.

A better statistic would be sub activity which is currently \~5,000 active members on at a time. That means the amount of holders is 40x higher than the active member count, so people who are active on the sub do care.

# Holder repartition is a Red Flag

Op claims having Moon whales means these accounts will dump their Moons and prevent any bull run. He also then creates a hypothetical disaster with liquidity providers based off a thought experiment. Again this is a bad argument, although it is true there are big whales that could dump Moons, there are big whales in every crypto asset that could dump. The largest individual Moon holder, holds just over 1% of the total circulating supply or about 2% if you don't consider Reddits Wallets. That isn't that much for a sh\*tcoin.

# Usecase &gt; Pump

Op claims Moons can't pump because people got them for free.

So lets talk another sh\*tcoin, AiDoge is pumping with a marketcap 9x larger than Moons, and it was given to people for free. Why would you buy this sh\*tcoin when you could have gotten it for free or can get it for free? Yet the price is up nearly 10X since it first started being given out.

So ignoring this flawed argument let's talk about Moons. Moons act as a Proof of Engagement/Reputation. The more moons you have the larger your virtual ~~d\*\*k~~  status symbol. People buy skins for video games simply because it'll make them stand out. Ignoring everything else positive about Moons, (Banner, Staking Rewards, most developed Reddit Community Token) people have and will buy Moons to stand out in this SubReddit.

As the supply that gets airdropped every snapshot continues to decrease it will become harder and harder to earn moons, and large Moon holders will stand out even more, further incentivizing users to buy Moons to stand out.

Embracing the Degeneracy of Crypto,"Hey all,

I was just thinking about that recent PEPE post, and it got me thinking:

So,  I know the term ""degen"" has a negative connotation, but hear me out.  Embracing our inner degeneracy might just be the key to success in the  wild world of crypto.

Think about  it. Who are the ones making the biggest gains in the shortest amount of  time? The ones who are willing to take risks and bet on the underdogs.  The ones who aren't afraid to throw caution to the wind and put all  their eggs in one basket.

Sure,  there are plenty of scams and rug pulls out there, but that's where  doing your own research and following the right people comes in. And  sometimes, even the ""safe"" investments can turn out to be duds.

So  I guess this sub really makes us embrace our degeneracy,. Let's take  those moonshots, hop on those meme coins, and ride the waves of the  market with reckless abandon.

Of  course, always remember to never invest more than you can afford to  lose, and never follow blindly. But with a little bit of degeneracy and a  lot of careful planning, who knows where the crypto world could take  us?

This sub recommended that I buy Bitcoin or Ethereum, they told me these are the best coins and with banks collapsing all around us bitcoin would hit $1,000,000 in another two months.

Me being a gullible crypto investor who does his own research by reading post on this sub decided to ignore all the other times the cryptocurrency sub has been wrong before and give the sub one more chance at being my financial advisor. I took the advice of the sub and bought $1,000 USD worth of BTC at $30,327.00 instead of PEPE or AIDOGE.

Now two weeks later I'm reading articles like this.

I'm currently down on my safe btc investment instead of sitting on a beach somewhere drinking piña coladas from becoming a shitcoin millionaire.

From here on out I'm only going to do the opposite of what this sub recommends, I'll be listening to all the shillers posting about their new dog coin or maybe even checking out crypto moon shots, I might even throw some money at Solana because it's sure to 100X next bull run.

my only shot now is to try to short one of these shitcoins at the top, and since I'm seeing the excitement for them starting to build on the sub, we might be pretty close to the top.

"I really hate that almost all our and the media's attention goes to meme coins, celebrities, dumb stories, and scams and hacks, while crypto's tech is so innovative and can make the world a better place","# Crypto's technology is amazing and can change people's daily lives for the better....

Some simple examples:

* Sending money from one party to another in a cheap and fast way without involvement of a third party.
* Relatedly, so much money was donated to Ukraine (war) and Turkey (earthquakes), without some of these charity organizations taking a major cut.
* NFTs allow artists to sell their work directly without a third party.
* Blockchain tech will become essential in supply chain traceability. Many companies like Walmart use blockchain to trace and protect their food supply.

And there's many more use-cases.

Its no surprise that every big company is using the blockchain technology. Think of companies like Samsung, Google, Amazon, Tesla, Nike, McDonalds, Walmart, Meta, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, SHell, UPS, and many more.

# ... Yet the media almost exclusively focuses on meme coins, celebrities, dumb stories, and scams and hacks

Yet there's really very little information on crypto's technology and adoption. Rather, the media and to some extent we as well focus on:

* Meme coins. PEPE is the new hype. Its a a useless frog coin.
* Celebrities. What did Elon say today? Or perhaps Craig Wright? Did Charles Hoskinson write a Twitter post? The list goes on.
* Dumb stories. The headlines of news articles get weirder and weirder. Everytime someone does something silly in this space it gets covered.
* Scams and hacks. There's so many scams and hacks, and each event gets loads of coverage.

I used to think it was funny at the start. Never a dull day in crypto. But the longer I am here and the more I learn about the blockchain technology, the more I hate that all the attention goes to the shitty side of crypto rather than how amazing crypto truly is.

"The truth about meme coins - by the time you hear about one, it's way too late to make money on it. The only people who make money are founders and crypto insiders. Ordinary people are there to be exit liquidity and that's it.","I see meme coins are starting to make a comeback and I want to warn all you investors out there before you get sucked into the fantasy of becoming a millionaire from $100 of meme coins.

The fact about crypto in general is that 99% of the time the vast majority of money made from a token is made by the founders and other crypto insiders... I'm talking about the big returns you hear about like $100 turning into a million. Obviously us plebians can make returns by buying ETH and seeing it double over the course of years, but I know that the fantasy of taking a $100 and turning it into seven figures is incredibly alluring.

What happens is that the founders and crypto insiders invest in the tokens before they start hyping them. The hyping process is there to create exit liquidity for the founders and insiders. The plebians are there to take the inevitable loss since meme coins have no real utility or value so they always crash sooner or later.

Of course there have been the odd plebe here or there whose hit it big with meme coins but they are far and few between. Please please please don't fall for meme coins... Maybe we can even put them out of existence through just ignoring them.

ETA: what prompted me to write this post is seeing all the posts trying to promote PEPE...like the article about someone turning $27 into a million. I can tell you for certain now that buying PEPE at this point will not give you this type of return and is highly likely to leave you with a loss.

On June 23, 2022, Harmony One was hacked, with $100 million of assets on the Horizon bridge being stolen. The bridge functioned on a 2/5 multisig contract, so the hacker(s) was able to gain access to the funds by compromising the server and getting hold of these two addresses. The question begs as to why the developers chose to be negligent of ONE’s security system. In an attempt to do damage control, the Harmony team offered bounties twice - $1 million the first time and $10 million the second time - in hopes that the culprit(s) would be enticed to return the stolen funds. Unfortunately, both bounties were futile. To be fair, the developers do not shirk their responsibilities as they are currently working on various plans that address about 50,000 wallets spanning across 14 assets amounting to $97.6 million.

Do not let yourself be tempted by shitcoins,"Hello fellow crypto degenerates.

I wanted to share my perspective after what has happened (and what is still happening) with the latest shitcoin's huge pump. Yes I am talking about PEPE.

I know that each time something like this happens, where you see a random guy turning a bunch of dollars into life-changing money, It can be very tempting to fall for It and trying to find the next big coin. 

However be advised that we (as human beings) always tend to give a lot of importance and relevance to good and positive events, while we tend to undervaluate the bad ones. This is a very dangerous bias that is hardwired into our brains. Do not forget that for every guy that is able to turn a bunch of dollars into millions, there is a thousand of them ""losing the bet"" and some money (sometimes even huge amounts).

I guess this is an advice especially for people that are new to crypto: pick a project that you believe in and invest into that. DCA, rince and repeat.

Will Binance List PEPE? CZ Clarifies in Recent AMA,[removed],1,0,2023-05-02 16:25:58,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]
Crypto disappoints me greatly with meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even.

I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with. I think it makes the space look immature and basically slows adoption by directing focus onto such nonsense. Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing.

If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso. And I really know deep in my heart a rug is coming, either that or they just suck the life out of it as more liquidity replaces the old suckers. If you want to contribute to something like this, you are the reason we are laughed at as a community. They don't see the good projects in the mainstream, only the jokes. And this is one of the biggest jokes yet, same as any meme coin before it. If you want to actively work against the community as a whole, what better way than to support this crap. Downvote me all you want I'm just sick of these shitty meme coins dominating the news when we should be focusing on more important matters, like the fucking recession coming. But hey let's just get distracted by a fucking frog right?

How to buy a meme coin relatively early.,"Seeing some memes are flying right now (meme season?). I thought I would share a manual how to buy these relatively early. 

1. Send fiat to your main CEX e.g. Binance, Coinbase. Then buy $20 of XLM. 

2. Open an account on gate.io or MEXC. Use a VPN if need be. They will verify you only with you email and phone number. These are non KYC exchanges. 

3. After opening. Generate an XLM address. There are two parts, the main address and memo I.d. Copy and paste these into a word document. 

4. Go back to your CEX (Coinbase for example). Send only 1 dollar's worth of XLM as a test transaction by copy and pasting the address and memo Id, save the address and send it. Then open your other exchange (MEXC). See if it has arrived (usually takes 10 minutes max).

5. Send the other 19 bucks doing the same process. You have now successfully moved money on chain. 

6. In Mexc, trade all your XLM to USDT first. Now you are ready to buy your meme coin by doing a USDT/BALLS (for example) trade. 

Why these exchanges? No KYC, they usually get these coins right after Uniswap. Can use Uniswap, but it is annoying with gas fees as they are. 

Why XLM? Stellar Lumens are usually the fastest and cheapest on chain. But could also do any other coin if you like. 

Tip: can set a stop loss too if you only want to lose half your money if it is a flop/scam. Also if it doubles (like Wojak and Pepe did for me recently). Take out your original 20 bucks and let it ride. Or even 50% up is a good idea too. 

I also give it a few days as well. Sometimes they need catching on. If they are trending on Coingecko and Twitter, it might still have more to run if it's a low MC. But this is all up to you.",5,93,2023-05-02 20:42:27,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL,"[('Hello ShotCryptographer523. It looks like you might have found a new scam?

This is just sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? 

The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming *shitloads of shitcoins* from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich.

Then I saw this:

$0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers. But *less than a penny?* Of course, lets look at that gas fee. PEPE volume has been insane lately, so I just knew I was gonna see some pain.

That's right folks. Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words.

Now lets have a look at this poor soul's transaction history:

Two transactions total. Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows.

At this point, it's just sad. This is like watching someone shoot up meth. Friends, please don't DEFI and drive.

Pepe (PEPE) Trading Goes Live on BitMEX,[removed],1,0,2023-05-03 07:06:21,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]
Why the next bullrun will be different to previous ones.,"Wether you are bear or bull currently it’s fair to assume that we are on our way towards another bullrun, obviously the timing of it can and will be debated infinitely on here, but we have seen a huge bear move in the crypto markets this past 12+ months and an upward swing is to be expected.

Here’s what I think will be significantly different about the next bull run:

Alts: 
Time has moved on in the crypto world, people’s awareness of what is and what isn’t worthy of spending their hard earned cash on has evolved, Alts on the whole are dogshit, they are a moonshot and for every PEPE there are hundreds of other worthless meme coins that disappear into obscurity, these last years we have seen huge amounts of people new to the space entering via memecoins and I think the heightened publicity on just how bad these coins are will see less emphasis on this sector next bullrun, hopefully many of the worst ones will simply disappear, the entire crypto space needs to slim down in my opinion.

Bluechips: 
Following on from the above comment I think we will see much more money flow into the top coins this time with BTC and ETH being the main targets for people looking to invest in the long run, globally people’s awareness of the word “Bitcoin” has become synonymous with cryptocurrency and it is the first name people say when you mention crypto in my experience, so it’s natural new money will gravitate towards it, it’s also the “Gold standard” of the industry. 

Secondary “decent networks” such as, and it pains me to say some of these networks but they are current favourites, Solana/Matic/Cardano/XRP etc will also see higher flows as people are priced out of the top coins as price moves higher. 

The NFT world had a big impact on bringing in revenue and raising awareness to the crypto space this last 18months but again that has largely been shown to be fugazi with 99% of projects either straight rugs or slow rugs, granted the 1% that have provided value have done so in a cool manner but the rest of the space is just trying to copy the vision of projects like BAYC/Degods etc and for anyone paying attention to that space it’s clear to see the cycle there mimics meme shitcoins: create hype, promise roadmap, create mint fomo, mint, sell into exit liquidity for those that got in early. 
I think the NFT space continues to weaken as it has exhausted the supply of willing idiots and kids with daddy’s credit cards.

The next bullrun will face plenty of headwind with basically the US government trying their hardest to suppress and destroy the groundswell of optimism that it could be a legitimate alternative to the failing global financial system. 

As always it will be down to the Hodlers to keep chipping away with accumulation of the coins that will ultimately prevail and hopefully some new, big players will emerge and not make the same mistakes as the likes of FTX and Do Kwon, but we al know greed will be the only winner and a fool and his money will always be easily parted.

A short list of crypto launch tiers and how to know whats what,"Hey, so today SUI Mainnet has launched and has been highly anticipated. As to this moment of posting, the price is still increasing, just like we witnessed with ARB weeks ago, right after it launched. 

I wanted to share some tipps and a small tier list, for beginners, on how to spot which launch might be shortterm profitable.

**Tier 1**
(recent examples are SUI, ARB &amp; OP):

These coins are highly anticipated and are probably making shortterm gains. They are beeing advertised by (crypto)newssites, beeing advertised by multiple Tier 1 CEX's(f.e. Binance) and when beeing launched are probably launched on multiple CEX's at once. Almost all of them have Venture Capitalists as early bird investors. These Cryptos(mostly Coins), are either innovating something new or are advancing. Beware the gains can be only shortterm before they dump a bit and then stabilize. 

**Tier 2**
(for example CGPT/GPT, the native token to a DEX on a new blockchain, a Chiliz clubtoken, NFT-Tokens etc): 

These coins/tokens have a base of users for their public ICO and afterwards protocoll/blockchain, sometimes an amount of early VCs have invested in them and they have some sort of relevance which is mostly shortlived. They are a lot of times beeing launched on a single CEX or a DEX but after releasing are slowly beeing adopted by other platforms. 

These coins and tokens are risky because they mostly have a shortlived pump and afterwards a massive selloff before stagnating or even worse slowly declining in value over time. Day traders can make bigger amounts of gains but can loose even more aswell.

**Tier 3**
(mostly tokens, like Pepe &amp; Bonk)

These tokens just suddenly arise and are very hard to track. There's a one in a million chance of either getting a token which makes a profit or finding something without a value. If you do find one and are early, you might become a millionaire without having to invest more then a hundred dollars. These tokens who do succeed, are in most cases not long lived either. They almost always launch on their own ico without prior funding and/or on the main DEX of their native blockchain with a soft launch. You never know which one is a scam or not. If you hear about it on a (crypto)newssite, its probably to late to invest in it. If you hear about it from your father and you haven't invested in it it is definitely to late. 

Going through Tier 3 (tokens) is like going through a junkyard trying to find something with worth in it.

**Tier 0**
(for example Cryptozoo, Jugs, Squid etc)

These Cryptos are most likely scams. They either are because they are blatantly advertised by influencers which are famous for not caring about their fans, beeing randomly advertised by crypto shills (*cough* Bitboy *cough*) or their whitepaper indirectly/directly say they are scams(Squid, Rugpull Token).

These cryptocurrencies are shitcoins and are only there to benefit its creator. If you feel like Jason Statham in Crank and need the adrenaline rush you can try to flip these tokens in the first minutes (or hours if extremely lucky) before they are beeing rugpulled.

These tokens will never be relevant. Do not touch. They are the equivalent of touching radioactive waist. Even interacting with their page could kill you and your wallet(aka draining it). Do not interact with them.

I really hope I was a little bit informative for the newer users who are unsure about launches and if to invest in them.

Oh and yes of course Moons are **S Tier** because they are outmatching every other crypto by beeing distributed to redditors.",5,16,2023-05-03 17:36:35,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE,"[('Hello KrunchyKushKing.

$REDDIT memecoin paying homage to Reddit and following in footsteps of $PEPE and $WSB,,1,0,2023-05-03 19:14:02,,CryptoCurrency,NEW-COIN,[]
"Just remember, when you are excited enough to make screen-shots of you profits, that‘s when you should sell.","It seems to be that time again of a Crypto rally where many random shitcoins just randomly take off. This kind of a “meme coin rally“, as many already call it, is usually also a top indicator for the preceding move up in all of Crypto. The order is always the same: First Bitcoin pumps, then ETH pumps, then alts pump and at last random shitcoins.

Even with that in mind many seem to FOMO into the latest shitcoins as PEPE, AIDOGE or what not. While quite a few right now are also in profits as the bought a bit earlier and there was enough money to pump something like PEPE even into the top 100 cryptos.


But through all of that FOMO and euphoria some are experiencing right now, they seem to forget what the fate from all the previous meme coin rallys as right now were, they always end in a rug-pull or Bitcoin starts moving down a bit more and they suddenly drop -80% in one day.

Those that are actually in profits right now may be very happy, but remember. The golden rule is that, as soon as you are so happy that you taking screenshots of you profits to send it to a friend, this is exactly the time where you should also be taking those profits and not miss-out.

I can even speak from experience, as during 2021 I ran a shitcoin from a $10 investment all the way up to $200, but did not take profits.

Everyone who has ever bought Bitcoin or Ethereum was once someone else's Exit Liquidity. There's nothing wrong with being exit liquidity. It's being the exit liquidity of a pumping sh*t coin or questionable ALT that is the problem.,"We always make jokes about being Exit Liquidity. But there's nothing wrong with being exit liquidity, assuming you're investing in Crypto Blue Chips.

It's when you start gambling on ""which sh\*t coin is the next Pepe"", or to a lesser extent going big on up and coming alts that you start running into problems. These pumping shitcoins either rug fast enough to make creators money or last long enough that early buyers get to make someone else their exit liquidity. Although a few Alts will be profitable long term - most alts in the top 100 will not be in the top 100 in one year.

Be happy you have a chance to invest in Crypto blue chips. BTC and ETH have a long history of exit liquidity making others their exit liquidity.

It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to its decentralized nature and lack of reliance on intermediaries, Bitcoin has several other advantages over traditional fiat currencies; including a fixed supply, low transaction fees, and fast transaction times, among several others. \n&gt; \n&gt; # Decentralized\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is (or at least, aims to be) decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a singular authority or institution.\n&gt;    * This decentralized structure allows Bitcoin to operate without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, and [gives users greater control over their own assets.](https://forkast.news/why-decentralization-protect-user-data-privacy/)\n&gt; * One aspect is the geographical distribution of its miners, who [can be found all over the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bitcoin-mining-by-country).\n&gt;    * This global distribution ensures that the network is resistant to censorship and manipulation, as it is not dependent on any single locale or group of individuals.\n&gt; * In contrast, fiat currencies, such as the USD or the Euro, are controlled by the central banks and governments of their respective regions. \n&gt;    * This centralization can make them more vulnerable to the same manipulation and censorship, as their decision-makers are concentrated in a single location as opposed to being geographically and ideologically distributed.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Fast and Cheap\n&gt; \n&gt; * In comparison to traditional banking systems, Bitcoin's fees are significantly lower.\n&gt;    * [According to yCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee), the average fee for a Bitcoin transaction is currently around $1.1.\n&gt;    * This is significantly lower than the [fees charged by traditional banks](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/01/banks-charge-high-fees-because-there-is-no-real-competition.html) for processing transactions or holding funds, which can be several dollars or more, and can in certain cases scale depending on the size of a transaction.\n&gt;    * Bitcoin's relatively cheap fees are likely because it does not entail the physical movement of funds nor the use of expensive infrastructure, which also makes it inherently more scalable.\n&gt; * In terms of transaction speed, Bitcoin is also faster than mainstream payment methods.\n&gt;    * Transactions made using Bitcoin can be processed and verified [within a matter of minutes](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_confirmation_time), compared to the several days or even weeks that it can take for the latter.\n&gt; * Overall, the low fees and fast transaction times of Bitcoin make it a convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional banking and fiat currencies.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Mining fees and settlement times have varied so much over the last few years that it is simply not a reliable platform for transactions.  Without predictable fees, a business can\'t build a budget; without predictable settlement times, businesses can\'t sell products efficiently.  \n&gt; \n&gt; A proposed solution for the speed and cost issue is the Lightning network, but unfortunately this again is inconsistent.  Lighting is not a network-wide upgrade, so transactions don\'t all use the ""new"" system.  A business can\'t commit to using Bitcoin if the transaction will probably settle quickly; they need to *know*.\n&gt; \n&gt; The market price of Bitcoin is an additional inconsistency.  If the price changed slowly over months or years businesses could adopt it, but when it sometimes changes hour-by-hour it\'s too unpredictable to use when selling products or services.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some propose that Bitcoin could be simply a store of value - an asset rather than a transactional currency.  Unfortunately that makes it just a collectible: it has value only as long as other people also want it.  Unless Bitcoin finds a way to have commercial value, it will hold value as ineffectively as Beanie Babies and stamp collections.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final nail in the coffin may be the unfortunate and perhaps unfair perception issues in our media.  Bitcoin is featured in stories about exchange fraud, environmental concerns, and rebel groups like ""Freedumb"" convoys.  Whether you think those issues have merit or not, most businesses prefer to avoid things that are volatile and controversial.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Bitcoin to grow and be valuable it has to be commercially useful.  In most stable economies fiat currency can be sent between people or spent by consumers at any time, instantly, and without transaction fees.  BTC can not make those same promises, and brings with it unpredictability and uncertainty.  Unless Bitcoin makes dramatic changes it is doomed to fail in the end.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics).

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Being a conspiracy theorist wont make you rich,"We have a couple of meme coins pumping right now and there are some whales buying. This has lead people in this sub to speculate that these whales have insider knowledge. A lot of people in crypto believe in whale conspiracy theories. E.g. driving down prices to buy cheaper or setting things up for a rug pull.

While the financial market has always had whales doing bad things, it doesn't help if you think whales always get it right. Or if you think every pump will end in a forever dump.

Whales get things wrong a lot. If you are old in crypto (pre 2016) you will know of people who were whales in the old days and some who are whales today. The market was small then and we knew who many of the big holders were. These people made mistakes and we saw them clearly. They got rich from BTC and then they would invest in projects that tanked. Some whales have lost a lot from trading. Whales can be just as dumb as many noobs.

Whales might be on average more knowledgeable than the noobs but they do make huge mistakes too.

Secondly if you think every pump is bound to lead to loss or is manipulation then you would have never made huge gains from BTC &amp; ETH. You were probably the sort of person that never heard about BTC in the early days or who never took it seriously. Your lack of knowledge is not the fault of whales.

One of the most frustrating things about this sub is how there are so many terrible investors and traders here who think it is not possible to make big money in crypto because they are bad at it. They think that since they are bad then anyone making money must be doing some manipulation or insider trading. Just because you are bad at picking coins at the right time doesn't mean there are not clever people who can do it. You are the type of person who bought tops while blaming whales of buying at the bottom and no one stopped you buying bottoms too.

Pepe is a useless project but if a whale times it right it doesn't always mean they are doing manipulation. They might be smart and make a lot or stupid and lose a lot.

$McWojak - Fair Launch on Pancakeswap - Just Launched in 8 Hours! next PEPE meme coin.,[removed],1,0,2023-05-05 03:38:04,,CryptoCurrency,NEW-COIN,[]
Just lost a small chunk of ETH trying to ape into PEPE,"Listen up, fellow crypto enthusiasts! If you're thinking about accessing an old hot wallet, you might want to proceed with caution. Why? Well, let me tell you a little story.

So, today I got the sudden urge to ape into PEPE. I mean, who wouldn't want to throw some small change at a coin named after a cartoon frog, right? Anyway, I decided to check out my old phone, where I had installed Metamask and an old unused hot wallet. I didn't think there was anything valuable in there, so I figured it was safe to use.

I copied the wallet address to my new phone, where I keep most of my holdings in a CEX, and transferred a small chunk of ETH to that address. I waited patiently for a few minutes, knowing that the network is currently congested. But after five minutes, then ten, then thirty, I still hadn't received my ETH.

Finally, I got a notification telling me that a transfer transaction had occurred 20 minutes ago, along with another transaction telling me that I had sent ETH to another wallet at almost the same time. It suddenly hit me - my freaking wallet had been compromised!

Now, I'm not exactly a whale in the crypto world, but losing 0.03 ETH isn't the end of the world for me. But it still hurts knowing that I basically threw money at a hacker. I had already resigned myself to losing every little dime of it anyway, since I was going to use it to ape into PEPE - a coin that pumped 1000x for no apparent reason a few months ago. But it would have been more thrilling to lose my money to a legitimate cause, you know?

Anyway, the moral of the story is: don't store anything for too long in your hot wallet, and change it up frequently. And if you do decide to ape into PEPE, make sure you do it with caution. Who knows, maybe you'll end up with a frog in your pocket instead of a hole in your wallet!

The paradox of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has been under 30k for many months now, even under 20k. The thing is that by now, the majority of people have already heard of this name ""Bitcoin"". But for some reason, they are ignoring the prices now only to come back when Bitcoin hits an ATH.

It was released as open-source software in 2009 and has since gained widespread use as a means of exchange, popularized by its ability to allow users to send and receive payments on a peer-to-peer network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transactions made using Bitcoin are in blocks through cryptographic calculations carried out by miners and are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. Miners, also known as network validators, use a [Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism based on the SHA-256 algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) to determine the next global state of the blockchain. Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to its decentralized nature and lack of reliance on intermediaries, Bitcoin has several other advantages over traditional fiat currencies; including a fixed supply, low transaction fees, and fast transaction times, among several others. \n&gt; \n&gt; # Decentralized\n&gt; \n&gt; * Bitcoin is (or at least, aims to be) decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a singular authority or institution.\n&gt;    * This decentralized structure allows Bitcoin to operate without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, and [gives users greater control over their own assets.](https://forkast.news/why-decentralization-protect-user-data-privacy/)\n&gt; * One aspect is the geographical distribution of its miners, who [can be found all over the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bitcoin-mining-by-country).\n&gt;    * This global distribution ensures that the network is resistant to censorship and manipulation, as it is not dependent on any single locale or group of individuals.\n&gt; * In contrast, fiat currencies, such as the USD or the Euro, are controlled by the central banks and governments of their respective regions. \n&gt;    * This centralization can make them more vulnerable to the same manipulation and censorship, as their decision-makers are concentrated in a single location as opposed to being geographically and ideologically distributed.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Fast and Cheap\n&gt; \n&gt; * In comparison to traditional banking systems, Bitcoin's fees are significantly lower.\n&gt;    * [According to yCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee), the average fee for a Bitcoin transaction is currently around $1.1.\n&gt;    * This is significantly lower than the [fees charged by traditional banks](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/01/banks-charge-high-fees-because-there-is-no-real-competition.html) for processing transactions or holding funds, which can be several dollars or more, and can in certain cases scale depending on the size of a transaction.\n&gt;    * Bitcoin's relatively cheap fees are likely because it does not entail the physical movement of funds nor the use of expensive infrastructure, which also makes it inherently more scalable.\n&gt; * In terms of transaction speed, Bitcoin is also faster than mainstream payment methods.\n&gt;    * Transactions made using Bitcoin can be processed and verified [within a matter of minutes](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_confirmation_time), compared to the several days or even weeks that it can take for the latter.\n&gt; * Overall, the low fees and fast transaction times of Bitcoin make it a convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional banking and fiat currencies.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The waste from it's parts also affect the environment as it's equipment only last an average of 1.3 years, especially, ASICS that aren't really reusable after their expected wear and tear. Although efforts have been made to address this energy and waste problem such as using green energy for Bitcoin mining, there is still a need to further improve this so as to avoid future problems in the environment ([10](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones), [11](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385), [12](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), [13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html), [14](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/), [15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)). Regardless with how small its effects are compared to other industries, it still should be a unified act to preserve the environment for as long as humanly possible for the future of humans and the world itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; **The Requirement of Being Responsible and Disciplined**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The constant triple-checking of addresses making sure that it's yours and not some dead end address or the fact that you need to keep your passphrase safe physically and never keep them in any device connected to the internet as to avoid any possible hacks/scams. The decentralization that Bitcoin gives you the freedom to finally be your own bank, but it comes at a cost. You need to be responsible and disciplined enough because unlike traditional banks, being your own bank doesn't give you any protection or safety nets like FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other deposit insurance corporation) when things go south.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n&gt; [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-2018-06-08) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140325214514/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-08/did-the-sec-just-validate-bitcoin-no-](https://web.archive.org/web/20140325214514/http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-08/did-the-sec-just-validate-bitcoin-no-) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2012/09/29/monetarists-anonymous](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2012/09/29/monetarists-anonymous) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-criticizes-bitcoin.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-criticizes-bitcoin.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/stiglitz-roubini-and-rogoff-lead-joint-attack-on-bitcoin-20180709](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/stiglitz-roubini-and-rogoff-lead-joint-attack-on-bitcoin-20180709) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/17/waste-from-one-bitcoin-transaction-like-binning-two-iphones) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58572385) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/going-green-how-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-powering-the-bitcoin-network-122042100219_1.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/a-deep-dive-into-bitcoins-environmental-impact/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9385063)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"Don't waste time thinking about wasted opportunities in crypto. Instead analize them and decide if you were just unlucky (it happen) or if you made actual mistake. If the former you have nothing to regret, if latter then learn your lesson and be better next time.","Everyone have some regrets in crypto space. It is normal. All of us have stories about ""If only I bought BTC earlier/ didn't ever touch that rugged coin at all / if I would buy this memecoin/ or sell something earlier or later"". But it already happened, either you made mistake or it was just matter of luck. If you didn't DYOR, get rugged or scammed you should admit mistakes were made, learn your lesson and next time not do the same. Improvement is most important step in your crypto journey.

Famous saying is: ""If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on you"". You in this quote can mean everything crypto related. Doing something wrong is not thing to be ashamed of, but if you do the same thing over and over you can't balme anyone else than yourself. Also never act like luck were against you. If you need to depend on luck you are a gambler and your decision probably wasn't smart at all.

I could buy pepe when it had just $600k marketcap. If I would throw just $20 maybe $50 I would have tens of thousands dollars now. I am bit sad I didn't? Of course, that would be a lot of money. But did I regret it? No. When I heard about this memecoin it didn't stand out, it was another shitcoin  that was more likely to rug than make me rich. I made calculated decision to not waste money. In 99% of situations it would be smart. But it pumped like crazy. I could regret it now and try to FOMO  into pepe or search for another memecoin that can possibly pump like that. But I know it was only matter of luck and just like back then now I still have no idea why people like it so much. So  I have no regrets. I made no mistakes, it was just luck. If that coin would die I wouldn't even know about that and have no second thoughts. Sometimes you need to be ""a man"" and admit  something is nothing to regret and you can't learn anything on your decision.

If on the other hand I would find some project I truly believe in and which according to my DYOR is great then yes I probably would regret it and should learn on my mistake. Such project for me can be moons. I truly believe in them and according to my best knowledge they have a lot of potential. If they will pump I know it won't be just stupid luck, but all effort Reddit and cc community put in them. Other coins like that are BTC or ETH. Maybe they won't pump as much as some memecoin, but unlike  memecoins they aren't popular just cause of hype and some luck. They have quality all of us should consider. If random memecoin pump nothing to regret, it was matter of luck. If top project pump then blame not luck but your lack of DYOR and not enough knowledge.",21,41,2023-05-05 13:26:47,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[(""It's one thing to have a regret like not taking profits on a coin you held, but you can't blame yourself for not doing something like jumping into a shitcoin from the beginning."", 2), (""Yeah I do feel bad about missing out on PEPE and some other coins \n\nBut\n\nI can't do anything about it, it's just fun being in crypto \n\nWAGMI"", 3), ('Just watch the wallets and wait for the next artificial hype coin.', 1), (""That is really good advice, thank you!

We might be on either the verge of a bull run or we’ve hit the top for now,"I’m 2021, I was just getting into crypto and was telling some friends about it and to look into it. A cpl bought into the big cap coins but 3 of them wrote it all of as a scam.

That just changed two days ago. One of the people that wrote it off and hasn’t entertained any discussion since texted me asking for help buying Pepe. I told him I can’t help him because I’ll be blamed if the token crashed. He was adamant that he wouldn’t so I said the most I’ll do is send him wallet apps and my coinbase referral and a YouTube video explaining uniswap

Well, I’m sad to report that they got it all sorted out and have gone all in on Pepe this morning. He won’t tell me how much exactly but said it was more than $5K. I told him he’s crazy for a first time but I guess we’ll see.

This anecdotal story reminds me of when people say “when your grandma calls you and asks about crypto….”

You think the current memecoin frenzy is dumb now? I have a dumb prediction for when the next bull run comes and crazier amounts of dumb money inevitably flow in.,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It’s time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun.

Look, you can scream “scam” and “rugpull” all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market’s euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino.

Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat.

There currently aren’t many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there’s a good chance the next memecoin king doesn’t even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can!

While it’s uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today’s memecoin investors are tomorrow’s BTC and ETH investors.

Are these MEME coins actually a good thing for crypto?,"I mean obviously they are terrible and are nothing more than a tragedy waiting to happen for a lot of people but hear me out.

The world is full of people in dead end jobs, bounded by the shackles or capitalism and financial restrictions. Most people, in fact nearly all people will struggle financially for a good portion of their lives and so there has to be a ray of hope somewhere along the line.

People play the lottery, gamble, hunt for deals and dream of financial freedom. They have done since the dawn of civilisation… So my point being, what’s the difference? 

The exposure of a few people becoming millionaires through crypto far outweighs the unfortunate many who sadly lose money. Of course it’s all a game of chance and timing but that’s effectively the only shot any of us have at actually getting to retire at a decent age.

I didn’t do anything with PEPE I’m far too cautious, if the wind is blowing I’m holding onto my wallet! But there are people out there right now who’ve just sold their measly investment for a fortune and can phone work tomorrow to call it quits. 

I’m not advertising these coins, or condoning them, I don’t have the right to do either. But I am at least partly convinced that this has a positive impact on the number of people joining crypto hoping to break free from it all. I wouldn’t be surprised if this mini pump is due to a spike in activity as a direct result of PEPE.

TRON and SHIBA INU are top 15 coins. How can we take the crypto market seriously like this?,"According to Coinmarketcap TRON sits at spot 13 and SHIBA INU at spot 15.  
If that's not bad enough, we have DOGE at 8, SOL, which is down more than it is running, at 10!  
Also, Tether, USDC and BNB...

To be honest, at the current stage it seems to me 95% of coins in the market has no real utility or intrinsic value. What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How can people not see the crypto market like a large online betting site when everything gains value from short time speculation and manipulation and when the price isn't really correlated with the quality of the product. It's just all the hype (looking at you PEPE). Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever.

Buterin then decided to donate $1 billion worth to an Indian corona relief fund, leading the SHIB owners to subsequently claim some disgusting moral victory that this was somehow thanks to SHIB. Meanwhile the coin plummeted in value after this event, leading to losses for whomever sold. To this day the SHIB owners gloat that Buterin is \'a friend of SHIB\' and that \'SHIB led to that amazing donation\', pissing on the graves of all of those who lost money in the wake of that event. Meanwhile they also pretend that the most important thing about SHIB is the community. But apparently the community can go [expletive] themselves if it means the SHIB team can abuse them for some PR stunt.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**The \'top secret\' roadmap**\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, for a coin supposedly centered around it\'s community, the SHIB team speaks of a \'top secret 2021 Ruffmap with a real budget\' that they do not elaborate on. Once more proving that the SHIB team does not care about its community, because if they did this \'Ruffmap\' would not be \'top secret\' but out in the open for the community to know about. It also leads you to wonder if this \'Ruffmap\' is even real or just an empty promise.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Decentralisation issues**\n&gt; \n&gt; Another indicator of SHIB\'s empty speech about community is the [Certik audit page](https://www.certik.org/projects/shib) pointing out that the weakest link of the project is.. decentralisation. Very ironic for a project that starts off and takes pride in being ""an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building"".\n&gt; \n&gt; #**The mysterious team**\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the SHIB team mentioned in this post, they are nothing but a mystery. Or, as the [Coinbureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/shiba-inu\\/) review put it:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I’ve seen no mention of a development team, and the founder of the token “Ryoshi” fully admits in his initial post on Medium that the token wasn’t even rolled by him, but instead was created by a friend who locked half the supply in a Uniswap contract and then sent the rest to Ryoshi’s wallet.\n&gt; \n&gt; One could interpret this in the sense of the SHIB community being the key focus here, but as pointed out above the SHIB team or whoever these mysterious figures are seem to care little about their community, despite their claims.\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Technical documentation**\n&gt; \n&gt; ERROR 404, page not found\n&gt; \n&gt; #**Conclusion**\n&gt; \n&gt; At best SHIB is a ship (pardon the pun) that is indeed community based, but left rudderless by the creators.

This latest meme season has shown me Ethereum is unusable as a Layer 1 and you cannot change my mind," 

*Opening disclosure: I do not promote you do the same, I have a very balanced portfolio but occasionally I will throw left over money into meme hype coins just for fun.*

This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**It all started with Meme season 2021.**

Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap.

Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap.

I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops.

Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience).

Follow my journey - so you won't have to!

**Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x.**

**Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee!**

&amp;#x200B;

 **Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\*\*You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.)** 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees).**

Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum. And I don't blame you. I have given up on Ethereum.

Total Fee cost for the experience $55\~

Total loss $250 ($200 of Wrapped Eth sitting on UniSwap).

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees.

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Should you short meme-coins? The answer is NO. But don't go long either...,"With the rise of meme coins once again, comes the inevitable opportunity to make and loose a lot of money. Many of these coins are scams, not advised to be invested in...

However, there will always be a not insignificant group of people who think that it is their opportunity to make money quickly. This is usually fueled by an even smaller group, who have managed to make life changing money on these coins.  
What ever your decision is, it is your money at the end of the day, and the risk to reward ratio is pretty clear.

However, the one thing you should NEVER do, is to leverage your position on these shitcoins. 90% of the time you will be screwed over, and the reason is not that obvious.

If you just decide to buy and own the coin, the price can go up or down. You can make money or loose money... but fundamentally, you still own the coins themselves. When you get into leverage, you risk being liquidated, and even more so with shitcoins.  
These coins can easily jump/dip in upwards of 20% within minutes, and then continuing their trend (wether its up or down). 20% is usually more than enough to have any leverage position liquidated. Essentially, you will always loose.

&amp;#x200B;

TL.DR: Don't leverage shitcoins like PEPE. Shitcoins have more significant price spikes, making it easier to be liquidated even if you predict the market trend right.

\- Not saying you should leverage normal coins either, just saying its even easier to loose money leveraging shitcoins.  
\- Also not recommending to invest in shitcoins

Ethereum Gas Fees are too damn high!,"Just went to stake some more ETH onto Lido and noticed that to do so would cost me around $50 in gas fees. It's insane that these prices are happening because of the meme coin fiasco! 

I assume this has to do with PEPE coin but surely this isn't a great indicator for crypto if something like this hype can essentially ruin the process for people doing something entirely different?

Does anyone have any experience of this beforehand and any way to lower it down to the usual $5ish gas fees I've been paying over the last few months.

I want to keep staking while I can and these gas fees completely ruin my DCA. 

Always been a big believer in crypto but seeing something like this happen really makes me apprhensive for the future. In the near term at least.

1. What's the difference between an alt coin and a meme coin? One is a serious investment that could make you rich, and the other is a joke investment that will probably make you laugh!

2. Why did the alt coin invest in the meme coin? To add some humor to its portfolio!

3. What do you call a group of alt coin investors who are always arguing with meme coin investors? A crypto civil war!

4. Why did the meme coin go to the moon? To escape the alt coin's shadow!

5. What's the best way to invest in alt coins and meme coins? Flip a coin and hope for the best!

6. Why did the alt coin break up with the meme coin? Because it realized that it was the punchline of a joke!

7. What do you call an alt coin that's always trying to be like a meme coin? A wannabe!

8. Why did the meme coin go viral? Because it had the perfect combination of humor and hype!

9. How many alt coins does it take to change a light bulb? None, because they're too busy trying to change the world!

10. What do you call a meme coin that's always making people laugh? A joke that's worth millions!


Once upon a time, Pepe the frog invested all his savings in Pepe Coin. The value rocketed to the moon, but soon began to drop. Pepe didn't give up and continued to create memes and jokes about Pepe Coin. As a result, Pepe Coin regained its value, teaching Pepe an important lesson about investing in cryptocurrency: have fun, but shitcoin will stay 💩coin


Once, Alt and Meme were at odds with each other - Alt was serious, while Meme was all about humor. But they realized that by combining their strengths, they could create something unique and valuable. They teamed up, created a blockchain platform that was both innovative and fun, and attracted a huge following. They continued to collaborate and make jokes and memes together, but bringing joy and innovation to the world of cryptocurrency many people makes money and so much people remain empty wallets

Coin with huge potential Angry Pepe $APEPE for all the ANGRYPEPEs who missed their opportunity,[removed],1,0,2023-05-07 02:25:09,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS,[]
Gas Fees.... OOof,"TL;DR Over the last couple of weeks we have seen ETH gas fees go from \~40-45 Gwei to over 130 Gwei an astronomical increase in such a short time. I feel like I need to say this but I am not against meme tokens but when you account for such a large transaction volume it kinda is the result. One of the biggest causes of this is the meme token PEPE which has led me to wonder about the impact this has to encourage adoption with a higher barrier of entry now existing and the old critique of pricing out people who are only doing $50 to $100 transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

After months of low transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain users have been hit with transaction costs not seen in over a year. This seems to have generated some unique reactions in my opinion. When Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake (PoS) it seems that some people still think this alone would drive down gas prices. I was surprised to see people still stuck on this idea since this was never the plan for Ethereum. When they first made the move and this rumor even started the developers quickly moved to squash it. Developers pointed to the environmental importance of the move given the political movements against crypto due to power consumption coupled with allowing more users to participate in securing the network.  

&amp;#x200B;

To address the gas fees issues faced other changes were implemented to try and help out the network. I honestly am not sure if they really fully worked to the state that we have given them credit for because crypto was and has been in a winter. Now that it is starting to wake up and move out of it we have seen gas fees go from 30 Gwei to over 140 Gwei a significant change, to say the least. What has led this charge is another meme coin run with PEPE exploding from next to nothing to having a market cap of almost $1.3 billion, larger than The Graph (GRT), the Sandbox (SAND), and even Curve (CRV)!

&amp;#x200B;

While some people love these episodes and enjoy seeing people end up with windfalls of cash I tend to be much more hesitant about the pros of this. With how much the transaction fees have increased regular Ethereum blockchain users suffer the fallout. People who might have been participating in other ways like DeFi, NFT trading, or investing/utilizing other tokens on the blockchain bear the brunt of this. It also gives people on the outside who could be looking to onboard into crypto pause because the barrier to entry has increased so much. Others who have dogged and hated on crypto as well are given more ammunition to argue against the cause.  

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments can be made either way about the meme token craze and its impact. I am torn between the pros and cons since I love seeing people secure a nice bag odds are new and inexperienced people are the ones who are going to be left holding the bag when the PEPE craze fads as meme token crazes always do. If you made money on PEPE congrats that is amazing! Looking forward though it just seems like it might end up doing more harm than good to the overall crypto industry.  ",49,211,2023-05-07 02:37:29,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[(""Hey.

"Twitter user should be a multi millionaire because he invested $1500 in PEPE on April 16, but bought the wrong PEPE and ended up getting rugged","The Twitter user Castillo Trading heard about PEPE early and bought $1500 worth of PEPE mid April, around the launch. He thought he earned a ton of money only to come home after the weekend and realizing that he bought the wrong PEPE coin. He was incredibly disappointed.

Back then, hundreds of Twitter users expressed their sympathies.

Since then, however, PEPE has continued its insane run all the way to a $1.67 billion market cap. Castillo Trading did not try again and is now feeling sick to his stomach, knowing that he lost his chance of becoming a multi millionaire.

Why you don’t have to listen to people on this sub all the time,"Obviously there are a lot of experts on here who have made decent amounts of profit but please remember that isn’t everyone. Also, they might have limited experience or even lost a lot of their money in scams or shitcoins, or perhaps they even trusted the wrong exchange. 

For some posters there biggest crypto asset might be their moons earned from this subreddit. So you might want to take peoples advice with a pinch of salt.

According to Lending Tree: (In a crypto survey where participants took part in a survey posted in Jan ‘23). The survey is about retail investors:

38% of Investors Have Lost More Money Than Made It

Some who've braved the crypto waters have dove deep. After removing the top and bottom 1% of survey respondents, the average amount invested in crypto — according to our research — is $7,738, with a median of $500. Many people have a set amount of money they're able and/or willing to invest. 

Disclaimer, I do not own much in the way of crypto and now hold only BTC in my portfolio. 

I read on this subreddit not to trust Binance, but for me as someone with only a small amount on the exchange it’s been worth it. 

I understand the concern, “not your keys, not your crypto” but really if you’re only holding a small amount, I think you can take the risk and not buy a ledger (which is fairly expensive in itself). 

I also read that you should not buy PEPE as it’s a meme coin and the gas fees will eat you alive. Then another poster posted about how PEPE was being brought to Binance. 
They also warned not to buy PEPE. 

I bought PEPE as a short term hold and sure enough it dipped a fair amount yesterday. Then after that it jumped back to its original price and more recently (a couple of hours ago) it jumped up to 10-11%. 

Then I swapped PEPE to BTC and accrued some more Bitcoin than I would have had by simply buying BTC. 

So, I’m not saying shitcoins or memecoins are worth holding for any amount of time or even worth purchasing but I will tell you that people who think they are completely right about every topic about crypto are not always on the ball as you might think. They might even have been a bag holder for Solana or might have bought into Bitconnect many moons ago, but you rarely hear about those stories. 

TL:DR People don’t know fuck about shit, even on this subreddit. Although, I’m glad you’re all early and congrats to the people who have made it already, but the reality is a lot of people are bag holders or shrimps.

Meme coin curiosity,"Okay this post is purely out of curiosity and speculation. I don’t know a lot about investing in crypto other than the fact that you can do it through an exchange, wallet, or a ledger of some kind. I’m not a complete idiot, maybe just a little bit of one, but I’ve always seen the meme coin success stories and thought…. “dang that would be cool to do one day.” I made the mistake of putting some in doge back in the day so I really don’t want to burn money and do that again… but my question is: 

How do people research and find these super low, unheard of coins? Where are they? And most importantly, if they’re not listed on big exchanges, how do you invest in them? I really have no idea how people are finding Pepe at a fraction of a dollar, investing, and selling all before it’s mainstream and listed on popular sites.

Someone just paid 64 ETH ($119K) in gas fees trying to buy a meme coin with 84 ETH ($156K),"Today, a user tried to buy a meme coin with 84 ETH on Uniswap and paid 64.01 ETH in transaction fee.

This was picked up by Whale Alert, a bot that shares big movements on Twitter.

People are mocking this user and saying that it must be Bitboy, because he doesn't not know how to swap on uniswap (see top post, lol).

While at face value it seems like an accident, various people are arguing that this was a voluntary move. Apparently he tried to buy some coin named FOUR and is *up* on the trade. But I cannot get this confirmed.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Submit an argument in the Cointest yourself and earn Moons if you win. Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"No, you cannot get rich from simply creating a new memecoin. You need liquidity first.","I've been seeing a bunch of posts about just how 'easy' it is to create a new memecoin in under 1 minute, and it made me realize this sub really seems to struggle with the concept of liquidity.  

You can create any new smart contract at any point you want, but nobody can trade anything for your newly minted memecoin until you add liquidity to a DEX.  

**THIS MEANS YOU NEED TO HAVE MONEY TO MAKE MONEY**

To prove my point, lets take a look at PEPE.

Here we can see the contract for PEPE was created about 25 days ago as of this post.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2afae7763487e60b893cb57803694810e6d3d136186a6de6719921afd7ca304a](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2afae7763487e60b893cb57803694810e6d3d136186a6de6719921afd7ca304a)

[Creating 420,690,000,000,000 PEPE cost around 0.037 ETH](https://preview.redd.it/0hj7qy76yoya1.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0c3925c447357ebc944daabd8afac51529f8d4)

The PEPE Deployer address has only 1 other transaction before creating PEPE, and it was a transfer from Bybit for 2.2 ETH.  This transaction happened approximately 9 hours before creating PEPE.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x242b41990d2ab19c10666e7c4c5514f8eb1afa6e20f12a9e65431dde131311e3](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x242b41990d2ab19c10666e7c4c5514f8eb1afa6e20f12a9e65431dde131311e3)

This 2.2 ETH was subsequently used to fund the liquidity pool in Uniswap, thus a memecoin is born.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x273894b35d8c30d32e1ffa22ee6aa320cc9f55f2adbba0583594ed47c031f6f6](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x273894b35d8c30d32e1ffa22ee6aa320cc9f55f2adbba0583594ed47c031f6f6)

[2 ETH and 391,662,390,000,000 PEPE go into a Uniswap pool](https://preview.redd.it/wnn2fap9zoya1.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d59d6bd540ef39adb5e6efabb61fe93e1bc132e6)

So PEPE could have been just another completely useless smart contract, if it weren't for the creator putting 2 ETH into a pool so that you can actually purchase the tokens.

And for brevity sake, here is the timeline of events in one screenshot:

Recent rise of meme coins expose bag dumpers and low morale influencers !,"
Recent rise of meme coins exposes a lot of people / entities of their money grabbing greedy nature with no morale at all. 

I am personally quite sad that my used-to-be favorite youtube channels who were once produce quality contents and still have 2M+ subs shilling PEPE just right after Binance list it( clearly an attempt to dump the subscribers). 

Even they got some of us in this sub (you know you did it). 

No matter how exchanges said they are very careful with due diligence with listing process, customer safety and whatever , their decisions to list that coin EXPOSE them that They don't Care after all aside Trading Fees and Traffic. 

We should appreciate those _ 

- CryptoTubers who doesn't cover that shitcoin, even if they did, they did it as news . 
- Exchanges that don't list them 
- Awesome r/cc redditors who speak out against that shitcoin since the start

Could this spread as fear in ETH? So the price dumps.\n\nHigh gas fees are a HUGE BENEFIT to Ethereum. How else do you think a blockchain should come up with the money to secure itself, if it doesn't sell blockspace?\n\nThe base layer isn't for us anymore anyway, just going off the Ethereum roadmap. L1 blockspace is too scarce for *every* transaction, but it is incredibly secure and decentralized so still very useful. How to utilize that? In the new roadmap - instead of scarce L1 space being consumed to secure *one* of our transactions it will be consumed to secure *an entire blockchain* with instead, aka a Rollup.\n\nWe're meant to use Rollup's now as it will reduce our fees by approx 90% today, and by the end of the summer that will drop potentially to 99% more with www.eip4844.com. That turns a $10 fee to $1, soon to $0.01. Rollups are effectively blockspace compressors and resellers.\n\nSince Rollup's are paying that high L1 fee, there's still an insatiable demand for ETH blockspace despite users paying low/no fee. Pretty soon the network will be nearly free to use the same time it's deflationary from so much ETH being consumed, counter intuitive. The IMX rollup is already free to use today, they charge $1 to mint an NFT and use that to subsidise the rest of their network with.\n\nBecause Rollup's exist INSIDE of Ethereum, if one goes offline or censors you can use the ETH L1 to come get you out. This means a Rollup can be centralized while still inhereting Ethereum's decentralization. A Rollup can't spend or take or mint your money.\n\nFees are all part of the plan. ETH with low fees means it's speculative and very risky/unsustainable, same with BTC with low fees. The new business model is to sell secure blockspace to novel blockchains - they'll pay higher fees than any of us ever could. High fees are a good problem for a blockchain to have, especially in POS where investors can easily and more quickly tap into them.\n\nhttps://ultrasound.money/\n\nhttps://l2fees.info/\n\nhttps://cryptofees.info/\n\nhttps://moneyprinter.info/"", 1), ('Granpa Btc goes slow but he is always first.', 2), (""I don't really care about the small stuff like dips or gas fees, just buy every paycheck"", 1), (""Not gonna worry about short term dips.

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # PRO\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **One of the OG Coins**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Doge was the first meme coin to appear on the crypto market, having been created in late 2013. Despite thousands of new meme coins attempting to dethrone it, it remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization almost 9 years later. The number of supporters it has amassed since its inception is no small feat, and it has even increased during the most recent bull run. Doge has come a long way since being labeled as just a joke and now become more of the household names in Crypto. In terms of market time, Doge clearly has the upper hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction Fees and Block Time**\n&gt; \n&gt; * The most recent average transaction fee for Dogecoin is 0.768 DOGE or $0.046 with a block time of approximately 1 minute. These are the metrics that define an ideal cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. In comparison to BTC and ETH, which have transaction fees of 0.000045 BTC or $0.875 and 0.0023 ETH or $3.13, respectively, and average block times of around 10 minutes and 0.2 minutes. If a user wants to make a transfer, Dogecoin is one of the better options because it has less expensive transaction fees and has faster block times than most cryptocurrencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Day-Trader\'s Paradise**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin is a haven for day traders due to its volatility on multiple exchanges and hundreds of pairs. Although the cryptocurrency market is volatile in general, Dogecoin has the advantage of being an older coin than most meme coins, allowing for a more secure network, a high transaction rate, and extreme price fluctuations. Traders will be able to trade doge on a daily basis without having to worry about blackouts or network congestions (except when the exchange itself is pausing transactions, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Community Owned**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Dogecoin has a strong community, with 2.3 million Reddit users, 3.4 million Twitter followers, and 30K Discord users. Dogecoin has come a long way from being referred to as ""a joke"" to being considered a reputable coin in the top ten cryptocurrencies. You can find their announcements, trail map, FAQs, guides, advisories, and dev blogs on their website (which is clean and very meme-like in its own way). They also have notable advisors on board, including Elon Musk\'s (Legal and Finance) representative and Vitalik Buterin. The Doge community, through the Doge Foundation, also participated in numerous fundraisers and other charitable acts, demonstrating a more positive side of the otherwise vilified crypto communities labeled as ""greedy"" or ""degenerates.""\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/tweets-btc-eth-doge.html#3m*](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-doge-dogecoin.html#3y)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING*](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/COPYING) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3091219*](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603102446/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3091219) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/*](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211215434/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-jamaican-bobsled-dogecoin-currency-meme-20140120-story.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140202003942/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-donors-help-send-indian-athletes-sochi-2D12024654) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140736/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/most-valuable-tweet-history-donates-11000-worth-dogecoin-kenyan-water-charity-1440565)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

"Why Do Developers Create Popular Meme Coins On Ethereum Mainnet Despite Complaints About High Gas Fees From The Majority Of The Investors? Possible Reasons Like Legitimacy, Liquidity, And Forced HODL Explained.","Hi everyone,

In the past weeks we saw a lot of meme coins popping up and it turned in to a hype. Yet the majority of these tokens are on Ethereum mainnet which has a lot of gas fees or swapping fees on DEX. Especially when there is a lot of activity on Ethereum mainnet which drives the gas fees up further. But there are a lot of cheaper solutions like L2 solutions which are overlooked for some reason. In this post I try to explain why creators still chose to use Ethereum mainnet.

**An example is the popular meme coin Pepe:**

[CoinMarketCap Pepe information and price chart](https://preview.redd.it/vpm4ptoab1za1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f01dae70ce5d31bb4ca40d2b8ab752d2c3a5d79)

**The three possible reasons (in my opinion) why developers create meme coins on Ethereum mainnet are the following:**

**1) Legitimacy** 

In the crypto world, Ethereum mainnet is considered one of the most robust chains out there. Additionally, it can make it for example easier for developers to implement complex tokenomics for some particular memecoins. The Ethereum foundation also keeps upgrading their chain. Beside these arguments there are a more legit tokens on Ethereum than on BSC for example. 

Another advantage is that almost all CEX support Ethereum mainnet, so it's easier for popular meme coins to get listed on big CEX like Binance. For example if a popular meme coin would pop up on Arbitrum Nova it wouldn't list that easy/fast on well-known CEX.

**2) Liquidity** 

Ethereum has a lot of liquidity out there since it's the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and it has a big user base. Many whales hold Ethereum in their hot wallets, making it easier for them to buy these tokens with the liquidity in their wallets. Many of these whales are not willing to bridge their ETH to ETH on Arbitrum Nova, for example, just because of the hassle. Don't forget that bridges like Orbiter also have a certain amount of liquidity to bridge, so this could stop a whale from spending (more) money on a particular token.

**3) Forced HODL**

Many smaller investors (or gamblers) only want to invest a small amount of money just in case the tokens pumps. What happens next is that if the token doesn't perform that well, it will cost more in gas fees to convert than the actual value of their holdings to swap back for ETH. This way a lot of ETH stay in the pool and prevents a bigger price drop. This way investors are forced HODLing their meme coin and could potential lead to exit liquidity for whales.

I hope this post gave you some more info on the possible reasons why developers chose Ethereum to create meme coins.

**Why do you guys think that developers/creators chose Ethereum mainnet as chain for popular meme coins?**

We were told a that a Bear Market will “clean“ the market from all of those scams and shitcoins. Now we can see that this was clearly not true…,"As a person myself that was present in the Crypto market since 2021 and saw our transition of Bull Market top to Bear market from very close on. Back then, during the first talks of the possible start for a proper Bear Market, there were a lot of expectations. Obviously many negative ones, but some even wanted to turn the narrative into the positives.

One of those were about the good side of the Bear Market, the possible “cleansing“ of the scams, shitcoins and frauds in our Crypto space. This narrative was especially augmented when we saw the collapse of LUNA, wich was also in the early days of the Bear Market. Then everyone seem to be so sure that this is just the beginning of the “flush-out“ for Crypto, which at the end will actually be good for all of us.

Now after about over one year and a few more collapses and actually many Cryptos dying out like ONE, everyone would be thinking the crypto space has been cleaned, but this is clearly not the case. We are having our first meme coin/shitcoin season since the bull market just right now. With shitcoins like PEPE pumping so much that it is in market cap even above our favourites like ALGO. So obviously that so-called cleaning did not happen.

Why could that possibly be? Well, the main reason is that Crypto has matured a lot and now we are actually even in the mainstream. Bitcoin is trending about every week on Twitter, people actually do know about Crypto now. So I think that those shitcoins won‘t ever stop from pumping, we are just now at a new level of adoption, where we have no way back.",240,286,2023-05-10 20:01:56,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('I mean it was partially true as a lot of *those* scams and shitcoins were cleaned out, but new ones always pop up.', 8), ('scammers always gonna scam', 2), ('Shitcoins will always be here from time to time, and it was true because they are being cleaned.\n\nDo you even know how many of them died out?', 1), ('[deleted]', 0), ('""Cleansing"".... seriously?

Surging Staking Rewards Rate Generates Record $46M Earnings for Ethereum Validators,"Validators on Ethereum earned a staggering $46 million in the first week of May thanks to a surge in staking rewards rate, which represents the annualized yield of validators. This was a 40% increase from the previous week's earnings of $33 million, with validators receiving 24,997 Ether (ETH) in rewards.

The rise of the Pepe memecoin has been a driving force behind the surge in fees on the Ethereum network, with average fees exceeding 100 gwei for the first time since May 2022. As a result, end users are paying over $30 per swap, resulting in increased fee income for validators in addition to their regular rewards.

To participate in Ethereum's consensus process, validators are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which is currently valued at approximately $58,000. The current staking rate reflects the expected annualized return for validators. According to Beaconcha.in, validators earned this impressive income by processing transactions on the network.

ETH Store, a company that measures reward rates, has identified two types of rewards for Ethereum validators: consensus rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, and transaction fees for processing network transactions.

The Ethereum network's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with The Merge in the past year, coupled with the Shapella upgrade that enabled validator withdrawals, has elevated the significance of ETH staking for institutions.",3,11,2023-05-10 22:53:20,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,"[(""It's amazing how PEPE and ordinals are driving up the gas fees so high."", 1), (""I'm happy for them but I'm even happier for amount of eth being burned"", 1), (""It's all about the hype these tokens are getting from exchanges"", 2), ('Burn baby, burn', 1), ('[deleted]', 1), ('Banks crying in the back', 2), ('This is probably the one and only use case for memecoins.

Best/any resource that gathers crypto centralization data?,"Is there any good resource that compiles crypto centralization data? I’m specifically looking to compare which of my bags are still significantly held by the founding team (XLM, IOTA, ALGO, etc.), and see if there are any promising cryptos I’m not holding that are actually decently decentralized.

That’s really my TLDR question. The following is a lot of word vomit on the reason I’m asking, so feel free to stop reading here unless you’re really bored or trying to avoid work like I am. Anyway—

My crypto holdings are mostly BTC at this point, with 0.5-2% bags of a dozen alts (Crypto Jesus and his 12 Altpostles, if you will, though you probably shouldn’t). While I will always have a fondness for alts, having gotten lucky essentially revenge investing in previous Reddit darlings like VET and ADA through the 2018 bear, I do want to start fully offloading the ones that are still heavily centralized even after over a decade of crypto’s existence. 

It’s still a very young market, but I feel that, in a similar way to how shareholders are really beginning to hold companies accountable for ESG, particularly shitty governance, cryptoholders will eventually say enough is enough and stop condoning centralized blockchains, which is just an oxymoron at the end of the day. I know that day is years away, seeing that stuff like PEPE still happening, but I might as well get ahead of it now since I’m getting old and tired of dealing with crypto’s growing pains.

And listen, I wasn’t immune to the hype either—I was convinced by the claims of impressive technology, such as a vastly superior TPS (though that’s not as difficult to achieve on a centralized ledger). I was convinced by the impressive partnerships being formed (though that’s not as difficult to achieve if you’re essentially giving away your crypto for free or for pennies on the dollar to convince companies to use or even just explore using your crypto).

Like I said, I got lucky with some alts, which more than made up for ~~duds~~non-performers that I also kept investing in like ICX and IOTA. I get it, the tech for a lot of these cryptos is still really impressive, which is why I bought in the first place. 

But the road to hell is paved with great technology with good intentions. I’m no longer impressed by soon™ or “game-changing” updates with cool names that people will continue to not use, except for corporations and institutions that are being paid to use the network, and people who want to buy non-fungible rights to GIFs, play games using decades-old graphics and gaming technology (but on the blockchain!), or receive 10% yearly staking/governance rewards on coins that have depreciated 90% in a year. 

Crypto almost entirely relies on the network effect to create value, and even in the tech world today, promises of “eye-watering value created by network effects” are no longer flying with VCs and other investors. I’ve worked for a long time at a tech company that went public a few years ago, and investors today are really looking for tangible results instead of grandiose promises of potential. Our company also has a significant investor that is struggling financially, so even though we keep beating expectations and producing results quarter after quarter, it’s really hard for us to bring on new big investors because they don’t want to be the lube for the whale looking to take a massive dump (another reason why I’m wary now of coins with significant foundation holdings. I get that the creators need to be paid, but I don’t want to be the one paying a dollar for a penny of current value plus the potential to make a gazillion dollars in the future. I’m happy to reduce potential profits to reduce risk and wait until the founding team shows tangible results that they’re building a viable and growing network that could compete or coexist with BTC and ETH).

I know I’m sounding really negative right now, but I still truly believe in the vision of blockchain technology, in the same way I still believe in the vision of the U.S., even if the current execution seems FUBAR. 

I’ll try to shut my trap and wrap this up—

TLDR: Is there a good resource that provides info on tokenomics (specifically founding team holdings) for a variety of coins, or are there any promising decentralized cryptos out there?",1,4,2023-05-11 02:33:47,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[(""Not too sure.

I’ll edit to say “non-performers.” I made my last alt purchases in January, which were IOTA and NANO, because I still am fascinated by DAG, and the IOTA and NANO communities at the time were still fairly active (more so than now). I do follow what my current alts are doing from time to time, and I dumped most of my ICX in Jan to buy IOTA and NANO when I realized all the updates over the last year felt circle-jerky (insulated to the shrinking network).\n\nAre you still investing in IOTA?

"Coinbase needs to fall, but not fail","I will start by saying this: I am not a fan of $PEPE. I spent exactly $0 on $PEPE, I hold none, I plan to hold none, I thought it was useless at the end of April when I first heard of it and I still think it's a useless $SHIB off-shoot. 

However, despite my personal feelings on it, [what Coinbase did](https://twitter.com/SpottieWiFi/status/1656450587683086336) was wholly unethical.

I hope this serves as a wakeup call for the industry. It's nuts how easily one entity can potentially kill a half-billon+ project based on feels. The last thing this industry needs is more gatekeepers. Anything that goes against decentralization, to me, is antithetical to the point of crypto.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities. These entities remain unknown and don't seem to have any interest to engage in governance or further development of the project so far.

They pepe and in general the meme community is fighting back with the deletecoinbase movement. It's impressive how strong the meme community actually is.  


Coinbase states that pepe is a symbol of hate for alt right groups. Pepe isn't even listed on Coinbase yet so it's surprising they sent out an email about it lol. I think the movement is strong enough to get the attention of Coinbase so let's see what happens next.

Is there any credibility left in the crypto space?,"Many people love to speak like if there is something good in this space. Besides the fast transactions and low fees for moving money around, is there something good left in this space? 

Shit coins. Alt coins turning into nothing. Scams everywhere. Big exchanges bankrupt every couple of months. Inside trading. Stable coins losing its peg. CeFi platforms destroyed. One man tweeting a meme and sending a coin 11,000 % up, NFTs of rocks selling for millions. Youtubers, influencers and people listening to them (not sure what is worst), multiple copies of projects released on a daily basis, hacks all over the place, zero utility, Web3 nonsense, metaverse and virtual land selling for hundreds of thousands and a year later no one cares any longer.

I think the whole idea of crypto had an interesting point when BTC came out. As for today that idea no longer exists because the whole space has been taken over by kids, crypto bros, moon bois, losers and scammers. I'm not saying the traditional financial system works. but I'm wondering if we have any credibility left. How do we really evolve the space into something more serious.

Pepe the Frog meme creator and copyright owner Matt Furie weighs in on the memecoin mania and says he's a Dogecoin maxi,"A bunch of self-proclaimed crypto influencers got Matt Furie on their Twitter space discussion to talk about Pepe and here's what he said:

&gt; Actually, this is the first time I've heard of it. What is Pepe coin? I've heard of Ethereum, I've heard of Bitcoin, and I've heard of Dogecoin; is it like that? Dogecoin's the best. I'm a Dogecoin maxi.

https://twitter.com/enjoyoor/status/1655708365748686848

Since he has the copyright for the original Pepe the Frog meme, he has also been quite vocal against its use for cash grab NFT ponzis in the past. Sad Frogs Districts project which was among the earliest pepe-based NFT projects [was removed by OpenSea](https://decrypt.co/78788/pepe-the-frog-meme-nfts-opensea-copyright-dmca) after Furie filed a complaint against it around August of 2021. Given how many more NFT projects and coins have come up around the meme over the last month, it's going to be interesting to see if he takes any further action to protect investors.

Anyone holding anything pepe related should beware since he's pretty serious about preventing wrongful use of the meme and had also [invoked the copyright law](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/21/16333162/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-dmca-takedown-fair-use-matt-furie) to prevent alt-right meme makers from using his work for spreading hateful content in 2017.

Pepe Coin Insane forecast,"I was checking out CMC today and found this price prediction for Pepe Coin.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://telegaon.com/pepe-coin-price-prediction/](https://telegaon.com/pepe-coin-price-prediction/)

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Maximum Price|
|:-|:-|
|2023| $0.00000523 |
|2030 | $0.0000809 |
|2050| $0.0051 |

&amp;#x200B;

So this prediction is basically saying that pepe will 1000x in 27 years. It's this kind of delusional predictions that keep people deeply invested in shit coins in my opinion. My own prediction for Pepe 2050 is that it'll be almost exactly 0$. The forecast doesn't take into account that most meme coins die out and become valueless in the matter of years (or sometimes days). This forecast is just assuming that it'll keep following the trends it has followed in it's short existence.

The Dark Side of Memecoins: Different Types of Ponzi Schemes,"Well, it looks that the promised ""Crypto winter will get rid of all shitcoins and memecoins"" was not totally true so we must then learn that there are different kind of ponzi schemes between memecoins.

[Memecoins](https://preview.redd.it/hbf69973r8za1.png?width=1801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6ea5e968c07b30fed68389d0c2a9748d9468b5)

Personally I distinguish two types of ponzi schemes:

* **Long term ponzi:** The ones developed in L1 ETH that use ETH gas fees price increasing to artificially decrease sell pressure but still they slowly rug pull investors. Example: PEPE 🐸
* **Short term ponzi:** The ones developed in Binance Scam Chain (BSC) which when they reach a marketcap the scammers think is fine, they rug pull investors in an instant. Example: SQUID 🦑
* **Chameleon ponzi:** The ones that change the strategy from short term to long term or otherwise. Example: SAFEMOON 🌕 which are in BSC but changed their strategy to long term ponzi probably because they saw they created a cult.

People who get caught making this symbol claim that they\'re playing the ""you looked at my hand and now I get to punch you"" game. For me, it doesn\'t really pass the smell test that a bunch of 30-somethings are playing this game when posing for photos. The far more likely proposition is that they are white supremacists signaling their membership so that other members of their in-group can easily recognize them. The media covered this similarly to pepe, and what I observed in the far-right communities where I was lurking at the time, was that posters in these communities ridiculed the media similarly to how they did with the pepe coverage.\n\nMy point is that it\'s incredibly easy to dismiss a media narrative by saying ""That\'s ridiculous; they\'re just a bunch of out of touch boomers."" You can say that, and it will resonate with people, regardless of whether it\'s true. The far right knows this, and makes a deliberate strategy out of this type of deflection.\n\n &gt; (which itself was a 4chan troll but this comment’s long enough already without explaining that).\n\nI\'m not really buying any argument based on ""sorry bro, just trolling"" in 2023.

And my assessment, at the time of that media coverage, was that the faux outrage from supposedly innocent pepe fanboys was the *real* 4chan troll op.\n\n &gt; Aldo just an addendum to that, it’s not like all the (iirc) Hindu swastikas were dynamited after 1945, nor should they be. \n\nAgreed. That symbol has its own, much older, meaning within that culture. However, it\'s pretty much unavoidably tainted within Western cultures due to its close association with Nazi ideology in our culture. Hence, people in our Western society who are not far right extremists, don\'t go around displaying swastikas. Pepe now has similar associations, and it doesn\'t have thousands of years of cultural history to absolve it of the nazi connection.\n\n &gt;  To do that would be to bend the knee and legitimize the racist context over every other innocuous or even good context. I’d rather not let Nazis have nice things lol\n\nI agree with your sentiment here, and your feelings are perfectly valid, but I would argue that it doesn\'t really reflect reality.\n\nYou\'re free to like pepe, and you\'re not a bad person if the meme has positive associations for you. But I am honestly telling you how others outside of your bubble will view it. We will suspect you are a far right extremist. Sucks for you, sucks for Pepe\'s creator. But how are we supposed to identify and combat extremists, if we choose to stick our heads in the sand, and ignore one of the common symbols which they use to voluntarily self-identify?', -7)]"
Opinion: This is getting ridiculous,"So, just going to share a little story and opinion from an amateur bag holder.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, it seems everything in crypto is just so scammy, it's hard to take any of it serious anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I posted about my shit bags and me contemplating what to do.  Well, out of nowhere I get a bunch of ""random"" threads posting up on my Reddit feed about this amazing coin that is about to MoOn, sO wEn LamBo?  Guess what it's Japanese! and we know how much Japanese love tech! JYes, Im taking about Jasmy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I look into it, and before I trade one shit coin for another, I remember that I suck at trading, and don't.  Good thing, because in case you haven't been keeping up, here's what's happened since threads promoting Jasmy have been randomly popping up on my feed:

&amp;#x200B;

Oh fucking noice!  That's for the heads up on something I've never heard of before Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, it seems like every day, some scandalous news shows up about crypto, or an exchange, or some scammer pumps and dumps, lawsuit against a coin or something, a guy goes to jail for buying a car with crypto...  I mean how is the average person really supposed to take anything in crypto serious these days?

It is *rather interesting* how PEPE looks like a rugpull. I'm not saying it is, just commenting on the appearance.

But this is why you don't FOMO. All you end up being is exit liquidity. Everyone who got in early was simply waiting for an opportunity like this to dump on excited traders who FOMOed in. And all of a sudden, everyone who rushed to buy is suddenly down at least BIG. Even those who cut their losses early are down at least 10-15% because the price was dropping like a rock.

There were also apparently some sub users upset that the sub ""prevented"" them from participating in the big pump. You're quite free to do as you wish with whatever coin.

In April 2019, it moved to its own blockchain called Binance Chain. Today, it operates on two blockchains, the other one being Binance Smart Chain. The coin is issued, developed and maintained by the biggest cryptocurrency exchange – Binance.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Pros\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT IS BACKED BY BINANCE**\n&gt; \n&gt; Binance Coin is maintained by Binance, a cryptocurrency giant. Binance is currently the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Its transaction volume is [roughly 6 times higher](https://www.statista.com/statistics/864738/leading-cryptocurrency-exchanges-traders/) on average than that of Coinbase. Binance makes sure that BNB finds more and more utility within their ecosystem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Backing of such a massive company should give investors a lot of confidence even though Binance is lately under an intensified regulatory scrutiny. But the company declares that it is doing its best to comply with all the regulations. They're working on a stricter KYC and they’re also expanding the legal and compliance teams by hiring many experts in the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; The co-operation between Binance and regulators was demonstrated when the exchange [limited its services for people from Russia](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/4887e569afdf4b1e89e024371d3a49b9).\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT GIVES YOU DISCOUNTS ON BINANCE**\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the reasons why Binance is so popular is the fact that their [transaction fees are among the lowest](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311). Users pay just 0.1% for most popular types of trades, whereas on e.g. Coinbase (Pro) it’s 5 times more – [0.5%](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees). One of the benefits of BNB is making those fees even lower – by as much as 25%. **Using BNB to pay for transaction fees can save you up to 1/4 of your money** on transactions. It’s a big incentive to hold some BNB.\n&gt; \n&gt; **IT IS DEFLATIONARY**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2021, Binance implemented two important changes to BNB burning mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, [Bruno Upgrade v1.1.5](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-smart-chain-bruno-upgrade-v1-1-5/) took place on 30 November. It introduced real-time burning mechanism. It is similar to [ETH London Upgrade](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/fixing-the-ethereum-fee-market-eip-1559-9109f1c1814b) \\- some of the gas fee collected by validators is burned. As of 15 June 2022, [more than 90 000 BNB were burned](https://twitter.com/BurnBNB).\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, on 23 December 2021, Binance announced and implemented **BNB** **Auto-Burn** protocol. It replaces quarterly burns which were based on the profits Binance made (they committed 20% of their profit to buy back BNB and then burn it. There were [17 quarterly burns](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/17th-bnb-burn-%7C-quarterly-highlights-and-insights-from-cz-421499824684902908)). Now, the process is automated, which makes it more transparent and predictable. The core idea has not been changed, however, the process will stop when the number of BNB coins in circulation is lower than 100 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MANY TRADING PAIRS, STAKING, FARMING AND OTHER USES**\n&gt; \n&gt; As an official coin of Binance, BNB also offers a **multitude of trading pairs**. All transactions made with BNB are lightning **fast and secure** since it’s based on one of the most secure blockchains – Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are also many options of **staking** BNB on Binance for a very good APY or participating in **Launchpools** (farming new tokens) and **Launchpads** (Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) - buying new tokens).\n&gt; \n&gt; BNB is **accepted by some service providers**, e.g. HTC, trip.io, travala.com, BitTorrent or PureVPN.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last but not least, BNB can be used to convert “leftovers”. Very often when you sell a coin, a very small amount of it is left in your wallet. On Binance, you can **convert small amounts of coins** (called “dust”) into BNB.\n&gt; \n&gt; **TWO BLOCKCHAINS THAT WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY**\n&gt; \n&gt; BNB operates on two chains, the above mentioned **Binance Chain** and **Binance Smart Chain** (BSC) which was launched in September 2020. While Binance Chain is responsible for transactions made on Binance DEX, BSC was designed specifically for smart contracts, DeFi and dApps. It quickly became **one of the biggest blockchains**. It is compatible with Ethereum allowing other projects to transfer easily from ETH to BSC and escape high gas fees on ETH.\n&gt; \n&gt; This dual blockchain approach combined with the **Proof of Staked Authority** consensus algorithm (a mix of share proof and authority proof) makes it much more scalable than Ethereum and enables faster and cheaper transactions. While Ethereum runs around 9 000 nodes/validators (before the software bug back in the end of August 2021), BSC needs only 21 validators.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also worth pointing out that Binance allocated $100 million for projects that launch on BSC.\n&gt; \n&gt; **DECENTRALIZATION AT ALL COST?**\n&gt; \n&gt; The main argument against BNB is that it is centralized. And it’s impossible to deny the fact that BNB indeed is centralized compared to Ethereum and many other projects. But every stick has two ends. This is what Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO, has to say about (de)centralization:\n&gt; \n&gt; [Many people think of decentralization as absolute; you are either decentralized or not.

How do you get over being scammed?,"I'll start with the obvious. I know I fucked up, I know I'm an absolute moron. I don't need to hear that stuff because I am already absolutely devasted and gutted. 

I foolishly clicked on one of the many ""Pepe airdrop"" links that got spammed on here earlier in the week. I saw the ""spam"" comments, but for some reason still clicked it. I thought just connecting a wallet couldnt hurt to see. I connected my metamask wallet which was empty. nothing happened. 

For some reason I then connected my main wallet (Trustwallet), with my 0.7 eth and a few other smaller bags. Then came the prompts to approve or reject what I assume now, was the smart contract. I don't know why, or what was going on in my head. I thought it would be more clear what I was giving access to I guess. but I didn't think and clicked approve. 

nothing happens so I just closed the site and didn't think about it until 3 days later when I noticed what had happened. 

I am absolutely gutted. I know it's not a huge bag, and it's not financially crippling for me. but I just have a horrible feeling lingering in me now. how could I be so stupid. I frequent this subreddit and know the risks, but for those 2 minutes my brain didn't click. I got scammed. I'm the only one to blame. losing $2k AUD is bad, but it's more the work I put in to get that ETH, and the potential of what it could be worth one day that really hurts. 


I can't stop thinking about it. it's ruining my mood and I just can't be around anyone ATM. how do you move on from fucking up so bad?

I'm also worried about some coins I have staked that are locked for another 4 months. they will come back to my wallet and will they get drained too?

So now that we have established that we don't know how new PLS versions of tokens on a fork of Ethereum have any value lets look at what is actually happening to HEX the eth token that promises to give you more HEX for locking up your current HEX without the token really doing anything other that being locked up by user to generate more HEX, where does the new HEX Value come from?

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm confused also](https://preview.redd.it/5te5uy3tmiza1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5062ac6525e785fac86d408016bc8013bbc260e9)

Anyway since Pulsechain has no actual value in it, the users are now selling off their HEX on Ethereum to move liquidity over to Pulse which is crashing the price of HEX (the token you lock up for periods of time to earn more HEX).

It fell more than 50% before recovering a bit and then starting to fall again.

currently down 47%

The people selling their $HEX to buy Pulsechain tokens are extremely excited right now because they are seeing the numbers on their trades in the hundreds of thousands, some are millionaires on paper right now. They do have one small problem, those numbers are based off of PUSDC which is worthless since Circle is not going to honor a copy of USDC made by Richard Hart on his own chain.

they are trading pulsechain copies of USDT, USDC, Dai, SHIB, PEPE, LINK 

This is going to end bad for the HEXICANS

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Submit an argument in the Cointest yourself and earn Moons if you win. Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

People on this sub don't get this.,"I'll make this short and to the point. This post is about memecoins and the hate surrounding it.

Everyone is saying that the only people who profited off of pepe are insiders and early investors. In reality, normal people who didnt get any inside info actually made money on coins like pepe and doge and other shitcoins. Even i was lucky to get on the hype train at the right time and made some profit.

 As someone said, great investments doesn't always mean great businesses. This is more true in crypto.

Unless you're in it just for the tech which i highly doubt, you have no reason to hate it or the insiders who made profit off of it.
Try to understand the ongoing trend and ride the wave. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to put your money in memecoins now, but just outright hating anything won't make you learn a thing. Just look at those people in buttcoin sub as an example. Don't be like them.

"I love blockchain technology, but am becoming increasingly disappointed with crypto and its user base. I can understand why the public has a negative view on crypto.","I *love* crypto and believe that crypto has a bright future ahead. There's a lot of great use-cases that can help make people's lives better. I used to have difficulty understanding why so many people have a negative view on crypto and attributed this all to a lack of education.

But I notice myself getting more and more disappointed with crypto and its user base, almost like a parent that has seen his kid do something dumb a few too many times, and can understand better and better why the public has a negative view of this space.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so many scams, hacks, pump and dumps, and meme coins. Everyone is just chasing the next big hype, like the metaverse, AI coins, and now meme coins again. Who cares about fundamentals? We all know these projects are worthless but they go up anyway. Even all the news websites just focus on the dumb sides of crypto. Its all just so empty.

There's very little attention for actual use-cases and technology. And who can blame them? Crypto is so innovative yet its barely used after 15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Many users are also behaving like idiots and make silly mistakes or just engage in dumb behavior:

1. People sent $5 million in ETH this week to Ben.ETH in the most obvious rugpull in history
2. A Twitter user should have been a millionaire but gambled $1500 on the wrong PEPE because he did not check the contract address
3. A user sent $1.5 million to the wrong address
4. So many people know about the basics (self-custody, dont invest more than you can lose, etc.) but straight out ignore them
5. People were FOMOing into PEPE after over a 100x in just a few weeks.

These are all people with crypto experience! How is this ever going to get used by the public, including old people?

&amp;#x200B;

Im starting to get a better understanding of why the public does not like crypto. And that makes me sad, because crypto's technology has a lot to offer and I wish people would know how great blockchain technology is.

10 years ago, this was a non reality. Today? If you didn't know any better, adoption would seemingly be a thing of the past, with full blown acceptance being the norm. 

Look. We have the attention span of less than a goldfish. Nothing you do will ever be able to compensate for you being basically a rube.

Now that we are past that, I want you to close your eyes. Think 30 years into the future.

Microvast owns 60% of the entire supply of bitcoin. Jamie Dimon loses the wallet key. The US government has entirely phased at the paper dollar in place of a CBDCB (central bank digital currency). And we the pleeble? Well. Most of you sold at the ATH in 2020, the late stage adopters? They pump the bag for the whales, and the early adopters? They get the golden parachute for the common man.

Okay that was a joke, but you see my point. The value of this is going to be directly determined by the whales.

What I am trying to incoherently say is, 10 years ago, crypto as a mainstream ideal was unheard of. Today, we see these currencies compared to the biggest markets on the planet.

In 30 years time, what side will you choose to be on?

Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

It was regarded as the first meme coin, featuring the well-known meme dog ""Doge."" It has had its fair share of criticisms and triumphs, as well as media problems, particularly with regard to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, who also considers himself the ""Dogefather."" Dogecoin is now in the top ten in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalization, with a trading volume of around $233,000,000, and is down 90% from its all-time high.\n&gt; \n&gt; # CON\'s\n&gt; \n&gt; **Memecoin Limitations**\n&gt; \n&gt; * Even though it has progressed from being created as a joke to a now well-known coin in the top 10, Dogecoin is still limited to being considered a ""memecoin."" Even recent articles from news and social media outlets see Dogecoin as nothing more than a memecoin with a historical advantage over other memecoins. There isn\'t much innovation going on in the development of Dogecoin, either. While they may have developed a wallet and have some other dev blogs, it still doesn\'t keep up with the development of the other coins in the top ten by marketcap. The main point of this argument is that Dogecoin\'s utility is limited to being called money; aside from that, there isn\'t much going on right now that would significantly impact their position, and they may eventually be labeled a memecoin.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unlimited Supply**\n&gt; \n&gt; * There will only be 21 million BTC available, with the final one expected in 2140. In comparison to Doge, which is theoretically endless in supply, it is an undesirable asset to hedge against inflation when paired with infinite mining, which will demand more advanced mining equipment in the future. It also doesn\'t help that it utilises the Proof of Work concensus, which necessitates a growth in miners in order to maintain the infinitely increasing amount of transactions. If Dogecoin and it\'s community is really serious about being one of the real deals of crypto, it must find a way to overcome a inflationary limitations imposed on it\'s code.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Price Manipulation by Famous People**\n&gt; \n&gt; * It\'s no secret that notable celebrities and artists are voicing their support for Dogecoin on social media. While this type of support is not illegal and does not depict any known premeditated acts of a pump and dump, it does not stop retail investors, day traders, long term hodlers, and whales from anticipating any post/interaction made by these celebrities with Doge and using the hype it created as an exploitative\xa0exit liquidity. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is the most well-known famous person that has been public about Doge. There are other celebrities and musicians (Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Marques Brownlee, YouTubers Jake Paul and Logan Paul), but Elon has gathered the most popular backing, to the point where he was sued in federal court in Manhattan for $258 billion in damages. According to the plaintiff, Musk utilized his vast social media\xa0influence to promote the memecoin, fraudulently inflating its price.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sources:*\n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://dogecoin.com/*](https://dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets*](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \r  \n&gt; \r  \n&gt; [*https://foundation.dogecoin.com/*](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29387913/is-elon-musk-finally-giving-utility-to-dogecoin-twitter-reportedly-working-on-crypto-walle) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction*](https://www.dmarge.com/dogecoin-price-prediction) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/*](https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-how-many-coins-in-circulation-is-there-a-cap/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270*](https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/*](https://bitcoinafrica.io/2022/02/28/famous-dogecoin-supporters/) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-celebrities-were-barking-dogecoin-205843101.html) \n&gt; \n&gt; [*https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/*](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/elon-musk-sued-258-billion-over-alleged-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-2022-06-16/)\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Boredom gets the best of us,"Hey, hey, hey! It’s me! 

So, I got a great piece of advice. Don’t get bored and stare at crypto shit all night!

So I recently had a kid (1st kid), boy. He’s great! A blessing from God! Truly my pride and joy this past 12 days that he’s been on this earth.

That being said, I get up in the midnight shift of him waking, fed, change etc. the last two nights he decided to be up for like 3-4 hours. So what do I do? Scroll Reddit, cexs and some articles here and there. 

We’ll here’s the problem, boredom left me “investing” in this damn Pepe. Got some 130 million for like $240. I don’t need the $240 so if it’s gone it’s gone. Here’s my logic. I just remember buying 1.2 million dogecoin for $100 and sold it for $200 back in whatever year. What’s a $240 risk? Overall, who the fuck cares or knows?! Rug pull or not, I pulled the plug and got some.

[SATIRE] Creators of PEPE start a new crypto project as a way of atoning for their pump and dump sins: POPE,"The PEPE creators feel very sad and embarrassed because their shitcoin pumped to a market cap of $1.7 billion in a month and then dumped over 70% in a few days, thereby hurting a lot of retail investors. The PEPE creators are aware that the price of PEPE will go to $0 because PEPE is just another shitcoin without any utility. Real sorry they are.

But they have come up with a plan to atone for their crypto sins and help the people out that got hurt by the PEPE project: POPE. **POPE is an innovative cryptocurrency that aims to help users rebuild the funds they lost with PEPE.** There are several key ways in which this will be achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Aim 1: Help crypto users follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments**

Users will link their crypto wallets/accounts in a very safe and secure manner, allowing a team of expert Christian moderators recruited from this subreddit to check whether users follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments. These 10 Holy Crypto Commandments are: 

1. Self-custody your crypto
2. Dollar cost average (buy slowly)
3. Make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and POPE a significant part of your portfolio
4. Do not FOMO or panic sell
5. Do not invest more than you can lose
6. Take profits (during the bull market)
7. Do not listen to shillers on social media
8. Dont advertise your crypto holdings online
9. Do not store your seed online
10. Do not click (suspicious) links

Users who follow these 10 Holy Crypto Commandments will be rewarded in several ways. First of all, following these Commandments should be a reward in and of itself. We know that users struggle to be good but following these 10 simple steps should prevent you from getting scammed, hacked, or duped by pump and dumps. 

Another way will be explained in Key Aim 2.

https://preview.redd.it/2abqlbxd700b1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48d207423a982a37acb9623f78716676a3f12fe

**Key Aim 2: Reward those who follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments with 7 Heavenly Virtues Tokens**

We will use a part of the money we earned by scamming our loyal frog followers with PEPE to airdrop seven tokens on the POPE blockchain. These are the 7 Heavenly Virtues Crypto Tokens. These tokens are:

1. Chastity Token
2. Tmperance Token
3. Charity Token
4. Diligence Token
5. Kindness Token
6. Patience Token
7. Humility Token

The tokens will be airdropped once per quarter to those who follow the 10 commandments. The first token that will be released is Chastity Token, after three months of good behavior. This process repeats itself until in the 7th quarter, Humility Token is distributed. This will be the most rare one because we expect some people to have difficulty following the Commandments.

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are  totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases.

In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have  Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they  often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice.

Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation,  even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation. If we would have 2 or 3 coins in total, we would be years backward in terms of tech and usecases.",22,47,2023-05-15 17:05:31,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE,"[('How about two coins then - BTC and ETH?\n\nAnyway, having multiple coins is good.\n\nHaving too many of them is bad in overall.', 7), (""Exactly, no coin can fit every niche and mass adoption shouldn't be just 1 coin seeing success and adoption."", 1), ('In Web 3.0 there will be a different coin for everything', 3), (""Variety is good, I agree with that, but 20,000 coins?

Some blockchains make use of a Proof of Stake consensus, but Harmony employs an unique Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) system that integrates sharding and proof of stake to achieve a secure and scalable network - one that makes it a cut above the rest. Not only that, EPoS allows staking from hundreds of validators, which preempts the problem of stake centralisation.\n&gt; 2. Harmony aims to be interoperable and facilitates transactions between different chains. To this end, it is making inroads. It has integrated with Chainlink since Chainlink’s decentralised oracle launched on Harmony. As such, enterprises who wish to use ONE can benefit from trustworthy price feeds of off-chain data provided by Chainlink. Plus. Harmony has integrated with Band Protocol to come up with a secure blockchain for decentralised applications. Similarly, Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle that provides prompt data updates and connections to external data sources, o developers can focus on creating their best work.\n&gt; \n&gt; References\n&gt; \n&gt; https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/technology/effective-proof-of-stake\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/partnerships/chainlink-launches-on-harmony-protocol-one/\n&gt; \n&gt; https://medium.com/bandprotocol/harmony-integrates-and-dedicates-portion-of-7m-grants-program-for-band-protocol-445c0a1522\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

These include:\n&gt; \n&gt; * **Recent $100m exploit sets precedent for future hacks -&gt; highlights lack of security**\n&gt;    * Just less than a month ago, Harmony's Horizon Bridge suffered an attack to the extent that the perpetrator stole over $100 million worth of cryptocurrency\xa0including ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, and DAI, among others. \n&gt;    * According to [a TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/), the security of the entire bridge relied on a single 'multisignature' wallet, which needed the consent of two signatures to initiate transactions. While this type of system is certainly more secure than single-signed wallets for the average, this is nowhere near as secure it should be for a protocol that controls billions of user funds on a daily basis.\n&gt;    * It is noted that about $2m worth of tokens were [returned by the Lossless protocol,](https://beincrypto.com/harmony-hack-how-lossless-saved-78m-stolen-tokens/) which may have a promising future.\n&gt; * **Not Unique**\n&gt;    * Ziliqa exists as an alternative to Harmony, and does almost exactly what Harmony does - albeit on its own network. \n&gt;    * Since Ethereum itself is trying to solve the problems that Harmony identifies, it's only a matter of time before ONE is made obsolete. \n&gt; * **'Next-gen' technology is a hindrance**\n&gt;    * Harmony's technology [hinges on 5G technology](https://learn.bybit.com/altcoins/harmony-crypto/) to work at full efficiency, which is not available in many parts of the world.\n&gt;    * Hence, accessibility is severely reduced.\n&gt; * **Infinite Inflation**\n&gt;    * The token's supply is not capped, and it mints 441 million ONE each year. \n&gt;    * As a result, while stakers are rewarded generously, holders continually lose money as the price of ONE is pushed down by excess supply.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

PEPE banned address with millions,"[https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html](https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html)

Basically PEPE Dev banned an address with more than 20 millions BRL (about 4 million dollars) in PEPE because the address seems to be linked with MEV Bots. The address purchased a total of 120 dollars of PEPE in Uniswap after 8 minutes it was deployed, but was banned very shortly after the purchase.

The address cannot send or receive anything, it done for good.

This is horrible, it goes against everything crypto intended.

Imagine beliving in a crypto where the Dev literally has a switch to ban any address they want? ""Decentralization"".

(PoS) Layer 2 on the Ethereum network. It was founded in 2019 through the Binance Initial Exchange Offering. The ONE coin is generated through staking rewards and is inflationary with no upper limit. ONE itself is used on the network for all activities like voting, gas fees, and staking. Like many Layer 2s it provides scalability to the main network by implementing sharding, implementing a seperate blockchain next to the main blockchain with faster consesus and smaller block times to speed up transactions. Using it's many bridges to the ETH network, of which Horizon is the most popular, settlements can be made faster ans cheaper. ONE is specifically mentioned many times in the r/cc subreddit and is a fan favorite. Although being a favourite the price action hasn't been kind to HODLers as of late.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is it considered to be a fan favorite? First of all the scalability, as mentioned before, is a huge pro. Instead of the 10-20ish tps that the ETH network can provide, ONE has proves to be able to deliver at least 2000 tps. Next to that it has significantly lower fees than the ETH network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Next to scalability ONE allows, just like its main network, the creation of dApps. Especially NFT marketplaces have caught on on the network. Among them are [MadNFT](https://madnfts.io/), [NFTKey](https://nftkey.app/) and [Metatrone](https://metatr.one/).\n&gt; \n&gt; Security is dealt with by punishing validators that misbehave harshly. It includes downtime penalties or even bans for validators that fail to deliver.

Here is the thing though, none of these small MC tokens is going anywhere. Even the projects with the best looking future is designed to make the founder and devs get rich first and people like me who find it first are bag holders for years before we see any returns if ever. Whereas for meme coins, people who are always reading and doing research will make less than the founders and devs but will also get good profits when the general public starts buying and the MC reaches $100mil+ .

- Those shilling coins are most likely using you as exit liquidity (hate to say this about our beloved moons.. but it’s most likely true)

A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining.""  Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex  cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the  transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network. \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; [IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a  “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; [USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:%7E:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?""  \n&gt; [The hashrate is near the ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:%7E:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago)  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding  Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so.  \n&gt; While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.  \n&gt; Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the  hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now? \n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:  \n&gt; \u200b  \n&gt; The Energy Fud Was Killed  \n&gt; The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  \n&gt; Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It  was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.  \n&gt; There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.\n&gt; \n&gt; [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes. Bitcoin is a good piece of technology and I hope people continue to invest in it because it is doing a lot of good for our future !\n&gt; \n&gt; &amp;#x200B;\n&gt; \n&gt; #\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Moon prizes are: 2nd - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin is just not ready for business, and without business adoption it will eventually fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest obstacle to widespread adoption is that Bitcoin is inconsistent.  Mining fees and settlement times have varied so much over the last few years that it is simply not a reliable platform for transactions.  Without predictable fees, a business can\'t build a budget; without predictable settlement times, businesses can\'t sell products efficiently.  \n&gt; \n&gt; A proposed solution for the speed and cost issue is the Lightning network, but unfortunately this again is inconsistent.  Lighting is not a network-wide upgrade, so transactions don\'t all use the ""new"" system.  A business can\'t commit to using Bitcoin if the transaction will probably settle quickly; they need to *know*.\n&gt; \n&gt; The market price of Bitcoin is an additional inconsistency.  If the price changed slowly over months or years businesses could adopt it, but when it sometimes changes hour-by-hour it\'s too unpredictable to use when selling products or services.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some propose that Bitcoin could be simply a store of value - an asset rather than a transactional currency.  Unfortunately that makes it just a collectible: it has value only as long as other people also want it.  Unless Bitcoin finds a way to have commercial value, it will hold value as ineffectively as Beanie Babies and stamp collections.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final nail in the coffin may be the unfortunate and perhaps unfair perception issues in our media.  Bitcoin is featured in stories about exchange fraud, environmental concerns, and rebel groups like ""Freedumb"" convoys.  Whether you think those issues have merit or not, most businesses prefer to avoid things that are volatile and controversial.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Bitcoin to grow and be valuable it has to be commercially useful.  In most stable economies fiat currency can be sent between people or spent by consumers at any time, instantly, and without transaction fees.  BTC can not make those same promises, and brings with it unpredictability and uncertainty.  Unless Bitcoin makes dramatic changes it is doomed to fail in the end.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

What kind of coins did you mainly buy?,"According to my observations, there are a few types of coins depending on their market movement and utility. 

1. Bitcoin - first cryptocurrency, king of our hearts, leading the market since its creation.

2. Coins that show potential and deliver - projects like Ethereum that are promising novelties, solutions to problems, etc. and actually deliver good services and have great developers. This shows in their market trends as they usually make their way upwards over a longer period.

3. Coins that show potential but fail to deliver - Not all coins are scams. I do believe that some projects really mean to develop as solutions to some problems and are planning to upgrade the existing tech. Unfortunately as the time goes, their roadmap gets posponed and postponed. They might deliver but in a very stretched timeframe. Eventually people lose interest in them and only the religious bag holders still hope for the project's development.

4. Meme coins ""pump and dump"" - we all know these, they usually dont last long on the market, developers hype people into buying and then sell their bags, usually leaving other holders unable to even sell for loss.

5. Meme coins that pump and dump and then somehow stay there - Im talking about Dogecoin for example. First meant as a total meme, but now has its own blockchain and even some utility. For some it is not considered a meme coin anymore. Pepe might be going in this direction?

"Shitcoiners are stealing the work of the Nyan Cat Creator, who even told them to stop to stop using his own. BitBoy team even promoted that scam afterwards.","It really seems like no day in Crypto goes without some shitcoin being spawned out of the nowhere and with the only intention to make the creators rich by the money of people who stupidly even invest in such a scam. But what is even worse than all of thise shitcoins? Yeah, shitcoins that are illegally stealing the work of other creators to promote their own “meme“ and make money with it.

After PEPE the meme coins race was on and it was inevitable to now have shitcoins of all those memes. One of them is the well known Nyan Cat meme, which even had a quite successful Gen 3 Avatar from Reddit. Now the Nyan Meme Coin ($NYAN) was created, which is using the artwork of the actual creator of the Nyan Cat, PRguitarman.

He here even called up to the meme coin creators to stop with this, but they did not listen at all and just continued. Later we even had the team of BitBoy directly promote that art-stealing shitcoin and we all by now know that they just take money to shill any kind of a shitcoin.

"Be careful what you see out there. Not all ""proof"" of a project is real, as sh*tcoin devs/promoters are editing screenshots of transactions and project information","In yet another reason not to trust social media, and not to trust the word of influencers, we see an example of sh\*tcoin promoters altering photos of transactions that are supposed to ""prove"" validity of a token(or something). 

&amp;#x200B;

Here we see another promotion of a sh\*tcoin that is **highly** likely to be a future rugpull. The screenshot ""shows"" that the transaction was sponsored by the PEPE Deployer. This is supposed to give legitimacy to the project...since it's done by the same devs who did PEPE and that this project can give similar returns and so is trustworthy(or something like that I can only imagine). 

But then we come if we use the transaction hash and view the transaction for ourselves, we come to this page.

We can clearly see the transaction has NO sponsor and has absolutely nothing to do with PEPE. Unfortunately this project dev has reportedly made around 10ETH according to ZachXBT(credit)

"Never trust influencers 2: After promoting a honeypot scam, Eunice Wong (126k Twitter followers) apologized, did not lose followers, and just continued stealing money. How is she not in jail?","**Who is Eunice Wong?**

Eunice Wong is a ""crypto trader/investor"" and ""Web 3 advisor"" and ""AMA host"". She is so kind that she shares all her trade ideas for free! 🚀💰

https://preview.redd.it/hfl0k2frhz0b1.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4970d30ffb94ccd5f62b3ec5120435bc450f23a

**What did Eunice Wong do?**

Eunice Wong decided to shill a honeypot token called Thaddeus. This token had a 100% sell tax and could *not* be sold so she lost her followers a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/prpzpqpwhz0b1.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6de568693a1b474d8938bbbb9d398438f7121532

**The aftermath - an apology**

Eunice decided to apologize. She is very sorry and said she'd repay the losses.

https://preview.redd.it/6iq37fomiz0b1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e74b6dee1087f2fe6c038574fc8d527dbf6b84a

And she did repay some!

... yet others she ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

**The aftermath - a lawsuit in the making?**

People are claiming they will take legal action against Eunice Wong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Eunice Wong just goes back to pump and dumping microcaps**

And what does Eunice do? Back to normal for her. She for some reason has the exact same number of followers, despite shilling a honeypot scam.

Now she is simply back to shilling shitcoins without disclosing that she is getting money for doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Example 1 - Ladys

https://preview.redd.it/5jjb7zswjz0b1.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67f0fa09f0518fd2548ca0d84486f43bb5f9d760

Example 2 - Pepe Cola Coin!??!

&amp;#x200B;

Example 3 - MEMD

https://preview.redd.it/o9dvli74kz0b1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e1604feb68277934a5973cc082323eddc7d576

What happens directly after she posted it? You guessed it. A straight -25%.

https://preview.redd.it/1hx764yekz0b1.png?width=1109&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acc5b0a0e4fa35e5a44a8e39d832ae18cd76287f

... because the founders dumped directly after Eunice Wong shilled the token.

Its crazy to think a meme coin got a billion ""invested"" into it in less than 20 days. 
Part of the issue is the hype train and FOMO that happens when something takes off but I think a majority of the blame is also on exchanges that are willing to list something obviously a meme and most probably a rugpull.

There are other projects that have been around for a much longer time and with a lot more utility than Pepe or SHIB but because of the publicity and hype the exchanges are just rushing to list these shitcoins. 

Pepe is anon, has no utility, no white paper and no real practical use execpt to fleece those FOMOing. 

Should exchanges be held to a standard at all? Or is it just going to be everyone chasing the money?",51,141,2023-05-21 10:50:01,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Notice how on all actually useful coins it took some time.', 6), ('Meanwhile moons going for that doge record', 1), ('[deleted]', 0), ('I’ve lost all faith in humanity after seeing this', 4), ('Had i known the developer PEPE i could choose the colour of the Lamborghini that i should buy /s', 1), ('I believe CEXes should stop listing shitcoins with no usecases.

The APY is, since I joined Binance, pretty nice, I would say around 5-10%. With the launchpool, you'll receive those new tokens, and as every crypto, they can boom or get doomed :) . \n&gt; \n&gt; \\- Launchpad : basically, let you buy new token before they get listed on Binance at a discount price. Last one was Stepn (GMT token), where you could buy the token for around $0.01. When GMT token was listed, price was around 0.15 so if you sold at that time, you already did a 1500% profit. Now sitting at  0.72, +7200%. You need to hold a high amount of BNB to benefit the more of this program, as only a portion of your BNB can be used to purchase those tokens in the launchpad program. So the more BNB you hold, the more return you'll make with this. \n&gt; \n&gt; \\-Binance Card : Binance offers a Visa card, with cashback up to 8% on every purchase you make with the card. Once again, the more BNB you hold, the more cashback you can get, eg. if you hold 1 BNB, you'll be eligible for 2% cashback, 10 BNB offers 3%. To get 8%, you'll have to hold 600 BNB. The cashback you'll get will be paid in BNB, which you can hold to try to get  an higher level of cashback, and have more to participate to the next launchpad/launchpool, or just swap/convert it to your preferred crypto.\n&gt; \n&gt; Binance pay : it lets you pay for good and services with your BNB, eg. pay for an hotel or even send money to a friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; \\-Fees: if you have some BNB in your SPOT account, you can pay for every fees when you make an order with BNB, and save 25% on fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \\-dust convert : it let you convert any dust amount of crypto you might have after trading or withdrawing to your preferred wallet to BNB. Fees apply obviously, but at least you can do something with those 2 cents of xxx tokens instead of leaving them on your spot account. Since you pay your trading fees with BNB, those few cents cumulated can maybe be used to pay for the fees of your next order.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Now those are pretty cool, but what if you're not using Binance? \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, since its launch in 2017, BNB has been on the rise. In about 5 years, it is around 1,000,000% up. The real rise happened last year during the bull market, when on January 1st 2021, its price was sitting around $38 and went up to $686.31 in 2021 may (info from coingecko). Now we know how the market was last year, with a pretty good start of the year, a fall in may-august, then an uptrend until November, and a fall again. Even with all those events, BNB had performed very well, and managed to climb to the 3rd spot of cryptocurrencies by market cap (stable coin excluded). It has been pretty stable and is holding his seat pretty well since then unlike some other top 10 crypto.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last be not least, BNB can  be used on DEX, Pancake swap being the preferred option there, where you can use your BNB and swap them for any token available there. Swap fees, transfer fees will be paid in BNB as BNB is the native token of the BNB chain. Fees are pretty low though. BNB is supported on a variety of wallet like Ledger, Trezor, Metamask or Trust wallet. With the last one, you have also the possibility to stake your BNB directly from the wallet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for coming to my Ted talk about BNB.

Doge, a cryptocurrency that runs on the Dogecoin network, stands out from other cryptocurrencies by presenting itself as a meme token with a dog as the face of the token.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Doge Pros**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Cult-like community**\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2013, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created as a joke. It is satire and serves only as a source of amusement. It was given that name in honor of a Shiba Inu dog with poor spelling skills who consistently spells ""doge"" instead of ""dog."" The advantage of Dogecoin is that its user and supporter base is well-established and still expanding. In terms of market capitalization, it is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally.\xa0The community grew massively thanks to WSB and Elon Musk making memes on doge thus creating value to the meme.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transaction speed and time**\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogecoin\'s superior speed compared to other altcoins is one of its primary advantages. The block time of the currency is 60 seconds, which is quicker than that of other cryptocurrencies. The retargeting difficulty time is four hours. Due to its low value, dogecoin is a good option for small transactions. With a low entry barrier and a huge number of coins with lower individual values, it is more approachable. Due to its cheap transaction fees, Dogecoin is more suited for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Decentralization**\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the cryptocurrencies on the market right now, Dogecoin is one of the most decentralized. Of all the Proof-of-work tokens, Doge has the second highest market cap just after BTC as Ethereum has completed the merge into Proof-of-stake Anyone can mine DOGE without special equipment because it uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm. This implies that there is a diverse global support base for the Dogecoin network. As a result of its high degree of decentralization, Dogecoin is one of the more secure cryptocurrencies to purchase today and hold over time. Dogecoin may prosper greatly as more and more investors begin to value decentralization.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Therefore, its properties were never meant to be sustainable in the first place.  Additionally, there was/is a severe lack of further development of the project. Years of updates and development of the litecoin network, from which it originally ascended, were never implemented. It would require severe efforts in development to catch up with existing projects. Without the willingness of big holders to spend money on this matter, this is unlikely to change. Therefore, the underlying tech of the project can be described as outdated and will most likely remain in that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, between its initial creation as a joke and the recent meme coin hype, there were several years of neglect in terms of any public attention. In this time, the majority of the coin supply was quietly mined by a few (mostly Chinese) litecoin mining farms, because they could just double mine it together with LTC. This lead to a situation, where the majority of supply is in the hands of very few entities.

In general, a white paper should give the reader insight as to what the coin is, how it roughly works and where the developers would like to take the coin to. Not having a whitepaper can raise some red flags. SHIBA has a whitepaper detailing its purpose, reasoning for being an ERC20 token, vision of SHIBA Swop, tokenomics and token allocations. The whitepaper is constantly updated over time to remain relevant with the last update 29/04/2021.

Hardware comparing Model T vs Nano X,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X.

Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides.

Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods.

The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely.

Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware?

(Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Security chip

The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances).

Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this.

&amp;#x200B;

# Size of the memory

Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB

&amp;#x200B;

# Supported coins

Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

Note the table below I took the info from

[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

[https://trezor.io/coins](https://trezor.io/coins)

and had a thing help me make the table. They both support ERC20 and BEP20. Meaning any token that is that, both will support. I'm not going through every token to make sure it matches this. I'm only looking at the sites.

Kraken Circle Jerk. Kraken actually listed PEPE a week ago and no one's talking about it.,"I don't know if I just missed it but I've been literally in this sub for almost everyday for the past 2-3 weeks, I might have missed commenting but I always opened this sub everyday for news and stuff and other fun discussions. But I've never seen any news about Kraken listing PEPE for a week, now I'm here to prove a point.

So Kraken listed PEPE in May 16/17 depending on your timezone, and for some reason it didn't made news in this sub. Not in HOT page, nor in TRENDING. Then of course it's expected after all the circle jerks of ""Kraken didn't list it, Kraken the best"".

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"
We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. 

Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. 

So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. 

Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 

1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

3.  Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

6. Meme Coins -  (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

8. Liquid Staking Tokens  (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"
We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. 

Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. 

So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. 

Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 

1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

3.  Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

6. Meme Coins -  (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

8. Liquid Staking Tokens  (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

"PEPE site homepage has a frog, pants down butt out and pissing on memecoin logos. PEPE pumps and dumps multiple times everyday. The same PEPE that is by far one of the most well-known and easily in top 100 most valuable tokens by market cap. This is embarrassing for the ""future of finance"" in crypto","PEPE is by far one off the most popular tokens. It was ranked in the top 50 tokens after hitting very nearly a 2 Billion market cap. Even today it still sits in the top 100 after losing over a Billion of market cap. It saw insane price increase of 1000% in a week, even before the Binance listing which again doubled the price. If you ask someone to randomly name a few crypto tokens, PEPE will probably be in that list. There's definitely **very** few in crypto who *haven't* heard of PEPE. Yet, we don't have to dig very deeply to be disappointed.

The pepe website homepage is pretty barebones and poorly done, probably by design, but the worst part is definitely this.

One of the most premier tokens has this as an advertising banner. I saw a document that claimed to be the whitepaper use a lot of material of this homepage in it, but it's unclear if there actually is an official whitepaper at all. Regardless of an official whitepaper or just the official website, this is pretty bad.

Of course the whole roadmap and pitch with Phase 1 MEME etc is pretty poor as well. The about section ironically call out the ridiculousness of modern memecoins(or mostly sh\*tcoins realistically) but also just buys right back into it for self-shilling.

On June 23, 2022, Harmony One was hacked, with $100 million of assets on the Horizon bridge being stolen. The bridge functioned on a 2/5 multisig contract, so the hacker(s) was able to gain access to the funds by compromising the server and getting hold of these two addresses. The question begs as to why the developers chose to be negligent of ONE’s security system. In an attempt to do damage control, the Harmony team offered bounties twice - $1 million the first time and $10 million the second time - in hopes that the culprit(s) would be enticed to return the stolen funds. Unfortunately, both bounties were futile. To be fair, the developers do not shirk their responsibilities as they are currently working on various plans that address about 50,000 wallets spanning across 14 assets amounting to $97.6 million. Nonetheless, this hack eroded many users’ confidence in regards to the robustness of ONE’s security measures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he’s lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. 

However, there’s more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it’s a little easier to make profits in crypto. He’s undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it’s still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world’s largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it’s also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. **So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he’s unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each.** While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling!

Edit to add: I should’ve titled this “but only in there money he’s lost”. I hope it’s clear from this post that I think he’s a huge manipulator and a problem for our crypto space.

2013 - My first Bitcoin transaction,"Looking back at my very first P2P transaction in 2013, I remembered how nervous I was. 

But it worked surprisingly easy. I just choose one of the many offerings of BTC and went for it. 

Until one day in 2017 friends were discussing the price development and I got curious. I was surprised how much my small investment made, and that there are people willing to buy that small amount of BTC from me, which I paid for so much less!

I was so clueless about the whole market back then. But who would have thought would become of this thing called ""Crypto coins"".

Therefore, it is irreversible.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, despite its popularity and growing acceptance as a legitimate form of payment, there are several criticisms of Bitcoin that have been raised over the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Unclear Source of Value\n&gt; \n&gt; * Stocks derive their value from the underlying worth of a company and its assets. Gold derives its value from its physical utility as a commodity. Even fiat currencies derive their value from the strength of the country\'s economy and their widespread utility within their respective countries.\n&gt; * Yes, Bitcoin has scarcity and utility, but does this justify its hefty market capitalization? [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu\\/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/) states that Bitcoin investors seem, in fact, to be ""relying on the greater fool theory—all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.""\n&gt; * Unlike fiat currencies, which are issued and backed by central banks, Bitcoin is not backed by any physical commodities or corporate assets. This lack of backing means that the value of Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the mechanism of supply and demand, which has been proven time and time again to be highly volatile.\n&gt;    * Some argue that this lack of intrinsic value makes Bitcoin a risky investment, as there is nothing to fall back on if market demand was to suddenly disappear.\n&gt; * Essentially, the price of Bitcoin is the price you pay to use its technology - making it seem similar to fiat currencies until you realize that most people [speculate](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading) or invest in Bitcoin rather than using it for its intended purpose. (source: [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-use-crypto-like-cash/))\n&gt;    * Without its utility being utilized, then, Bitcoin\'s value is significantly diminished.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Deepseated Stigma\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite its potential to revolutionize the financial industry, Bitcoin has faced significant resistance from mainstream institutions and individuals due to a variety of factors.\n&gt; \n&gt; * One of the main reasons for the stigma surrounding Bitcoin is its association with illegal activities. In its early days, it was often used on the dark web for the [purchase of illegal goods and services](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/32/5/1798/5427781?redirectedFrom=fulltext), leading to its portrayal as a tool for criminal activity. This association has persisted, with some people still viewing bitcoin as a way to facilitate illegal transactions. This is not an unfounded assumption; cryptocurrency-based crime hit a record $14 billion in 2021 [according to the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-based-crime-hit-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-11641500073)\n&gt; * Unlike traditional currencies, concerns have been raised about its volatility, with the value of Bitcoin frequently fluctuating. While this volatility can be seen as a potential advantage for traders looking to make quick profits, it also makes Bitcoin a less appealing option for investors looking to use it as a stable store of value.\n&gt;    * Yes, Bitcoin is [less volatile than the DJI and Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/21/bitcoins-volatility-falls-below-nasdaq-and-sp-500s-for-first-time-since-2020.html), but this is not a fair comparison because the latter are stock indices. Instead, Bitcoin should be compared to the USD as they are more similar in functionality - and as expected, Bitcoin is much more volatile.\n&gt; * There is also a perception that Bitcoin is complex and difficult to understand, which can be off-putting for some people. The underlying technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, and a ""decentralized network of network validators secured by a SHA-256 hashing algorithm"" is a novel concept that can be extremely difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with it. Yes, [98% of Americans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-comprehension-study-98-people-190349019.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCMe7hgrXllV_mlEw5tn7u-RoTKVu8UOYrfAhQHYKzUAGM48E4hQZFLRcL4GVt0esSNwGtDtWuNN8LD3ivbs2pcRmmXKpAAhCIw3ZGQQBTMTh4oR0X1OQSWD_jHYbNrgH2lOl0Wj-j6f59cNve0I7q_VF1bIqIqpbD9di-SF8yB) do not understand basic cryptocurrency concepts.\n&gt;    * This lack of understanding can lead to skepticism and distrust in the underlying technology, further contributing to the stigma surrounding Bitcoin.\n&gt; * Another factor is its lack of regulation - because Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside of the traditional financial system, it is not subject to the same level of regulation as fiat currencies.\n&gt;    * This lack of regulation has led to [concerns about its security](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/01/imf-warns-of-global-risks-from-unregulated-cryptocurrency-boom) and potential for fraud, further contributing to its negative reputation.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Submit an argument in the Cointest yourself and earn Moons if you win. Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

The hottest project in LSDfi space these days with TVL crossed 100M in just 1 month but it is created by a highly anonymous team with funds from Tornado Cash ?,"**Lybra Finance**, launched last month, uses liquid staking derivatives to offer a decentralized interest-bearing stablecoin.

So far, **Lybra Finance** has:

* hit **100M** in **TVL** in **just over 1 month.**
* recorded the highest inflow of stETH and ETH ($42.57M) on May 29.
* has 100,569 stETH staked ($186.3M) now.

It continues to lead in LSDfi TVL and market share.

However, the development team of Lybra Finance is **completely anonymous** despite the very promising project.

\- Deployer address 0x4c2 was first active on Apr 19 and funded with 1 ETH, which can be ultimately traced back to Tornado Cash via wallet 0x863.

\- This is rather untraceable compared to the dev teams of other ""anonymous coins"" like PEPE  (received first ETH from Bybit) and LADYS (received first ETH from Kucoin).

🤔 What is the secret that makes the people behind [@LybraFinanceLSD](https://twitter.com/LybraFinanceLSD) want to hide so bad after all?

Reddit is promoting crypto scams,"I was just scrolling through my Reddit homepage and I see an ad *""Claim $500 in Pepe"".* I saw the ad several times after that but here is a screenshot of the ad:

https://preview.redd.it/tgyrv4q58u3b1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d14c93e21377fe0deea61a54c9cbc482becdec1

This is an **obvious scam** but I decided to do some digging to prove Reddit is promoting a scam.

They are claiming to give a 90% Sale where:

Discount price: 1 ETH = 6,000,000,000 $pepe ~~(1 ETH = 600,000,000 $pepe)~~. 

https://preview.redd.it/ridtnx999u3b1.png?width=1040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f3b2768bf351aee1bad478140d4deeb918f70f

The *""Official sale address""* [0x59E37cB6712a089668f1524e1d39c730B73d17b8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x59e37cb6712a089668f1524e1d39c730b73d17b8) has received **1.1374 ETH ($2894.96 CAD)** over 32 transactions.

The nail in the coffin is this:

https://preview.redd.it/pgd5c9c8au3b1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93e24c127df14fe505f1c8bc0211c83dc4c7fe1b

The address 0xA9011e45e70914c52738498c7FBD73760d348DB1 [sent 0.1 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x187701c0e875714fdfc4441b160b26b7b933e549ef54bf815f464ae300fa3fbe) to the *""Official sale address""* on May 7, 2023 and never received any Pepe following the *""sale ending"".* 

The latest transaction to the *""Official sale address""* was 2 minutes ago from the time of me writing this and was **0.01199615 ETH ($30.53 CAD).** Perhaps the ad is still attracting the gullible, which is quite unfortunate.

"Be careful. Now, when trading volume has fallen off, is when exchanges can start to fail. Already two have frozen withdrawals, another collapsed and several other lose a huge customer base in the US. And a number of exchanges are showing clear signs of stress like dropping nearly all fees to zero","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0plrhcbuj74b1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=952fec461cdfb6ff09dd1c3d1e0bdcd4bda31d8f

This chart shows Bitcoin trading volume for the past 3 years and the current lows of trading volume are clearly visible. Volume is even lower than during pre-FTX 2022 when exchanges and platforms were freeing withdrawals and falling left and right. It is fairly obvious why this is bad for exchanges as less trading means less fees, that account for the majority of exchange revenue. This tends to put a lot of stress on exchanges and you see it in the promotions offered by them. For instance, FTX ran more than double the amount of trading competition promotions they did in the prior year than they did in the 10 months running up to their collapse in an effort to encouraging trading. Let’s go through the activities stressed exchanges are doing to encourage trading. As some examples:

* MEXC recently has dropped **both their spot maker and taker fees to 0%**. Futures maker fees are also 0% and futures taker fees are dropped to 0.01%. Now, they only make money off futures takers trades and withdrawal fees. This is in addition to the MANY promotion/trading competition emails they send)

&amp;#x200B;

[MEXC](https://preview.redd.it/dl2jjkl9m74b1.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a33429187f44fe8856506fee1d5748c37d5aae)

* Gate.io **dropped spot trading maker fees and fiat currency trading fees to 0 with 0% maker and taker fees** on BTC-margined futures.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gate.io](https://preview.redd.it/zamcgn3lm74b1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9836d7493a7acf02e7f365697019ea1d301c0c3b)

* Binance have ramped up activity on their launchpad pushing a lot more new projects. They also have quite infamously listed useless tokens of PEPE and FLOKI. It was quite atypical for them to list such a ew (and useless) token in PEPE and you should also question why they only now decided to list FLOKI as well. Bianance is also still running their BTC zero-fee promotion of the TUSD quoted pair.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, things must be pretty extreme for exchange to choose to take ZERO fees for the majority of their products. If people are buying, there'd be no need to drop fees to encourage more trading.

A number of exchanges/platforms have also lost access to US markets as platforms like Binance and Nexo have left Canada, due to new regulations. Bittrex, Nexo and MEXC had already closed doors to US customers, while others in the US face uncertainty. Coinbase is the most prominent, has been forced to stop its lending product as well as many Cefi staking service providers have been forced to stop its lending product and Binance’s BUSD is a dying coin as their issuer Paxos was ordered to stop minting. All of this obvious take it hit to revenue.

Now the dominoes have already begun to fall.  Hotbit, an exchange that serviced over 1 million people, has shut down very recently and BKEX, one servicing over 8 million, has frozen **all** customer withdrawals for some shady reasons that they claim to be aiding in police investigations. Patricia, another platform that service close to 1 million has also frozen withdrawals. It’s a *little* weird because there were also allegations of money laundering around two of them, and allegations of a hack involved in another but the reality is that exchanges are **always** dealing with money laundering accusations(because of the anonymity of crypto) and investigations and there are **always** hacks occurring under the radar. But make no mistake that anytime trade volume is low, fees are low, so revenue is low and that’s prime time for a crash.

Every brutal lesson we have learned so far in this Bear Market !,"
Edit : this post got posted in r/buttcoin and I feel like I made it. Yessss. 

TLDR : NOTHING IS SAFE until proven otherwise. 

This bear is exposing a lot of shady people / business and teaching hurtful and precious lessons for regular investors like us many many times. 

Here are my versions of what the bear has taught us so far : 

- Every old saying which are always thought of being true can be Wrong all along all of a sudden. Not your keys , not your coins , Yeah Ledger and Atomic Wallet ? . 

- Apeing into some hotshots tokens during brutal market will always rekt you. (PEPE). 

- Crypto market isn't bullet proof / standalone yet and relies to macro economics quite a lot. 

- Everything can fall no matter how big it is.  (do i really need to list out the fallen crypto businesses ? )

- Treat any crypto businesses as Shady, unethical, and guilty unless they are being proven otherwise. 

- Worshipping an individual instead of looking into their project / business will always rekt you. 

- Influencers and crypto youtubers has no interest for your investment and treat you merely as numbers. 
 
- Nothing is safe, cex , dex, hot wallets , cold wallets , until proven otherwise. 

I guess these are the key takeaways. 

Add yours if you have yours.

Comparing the seven day charts for some of the subs favorites - why are some able to bounce back better than others?,"How have the subs favorite cryptos and BTC fared during this troubling week of RED?

BTC bounced right back up near it's previous levels, still down a bit from seven days ago but nothing to bad considering everything that is happening in the crypto world.

https://preview.redd.it/h9x86u63dg4b1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42feff3002951ebf47c24bd0bf25ac048b7d6acb

ETH also bounced back up pretty quick, wasn't declared a security so it seems fine.

AVAX was already on the rise and looks like it also bounced back after the big drop yesterday

ALGO has been declining lately and it seems like it's just going to stay at it's new low now.

ATOM seems to be coming back up but not at the same levels as btc and eth (it was declared a security by Gary)

DOT is doing a bit better than ATOM (not involved in any of the current drama)

APE bounced back stronger than most. I guess the APE coin community is pretty strong to be able to do this when other more established crypto currencies are struggling.

LRC has also been falling lately, no longer in the top 100 and only a slight bounce back after the big drop yesterday.

What does it mean if a coin/token is able to bounce right back up after a day filled with bad news?

are the coins/tokens that stayed at the bottom only going to go lower?

Will ALGO and ADA continue to fall?

Who is still buying SOL?

"The bear market is doing an adequate job cleansing the crypto space of bad projects and actors. Although it is a painful experience now, this cleansing is great for crypto's future","During the bull market, people often proclaimed that the bear market will cleanse the crypto space. Now that we are deep in bear territory, a popular opinion here is that the bear market did not do its job of cleansing this space. For instance, there was a post on this a little over a month ago when shitcoins were popping off

It is true that we have not gotten rid of *all* the shitty projects. However, I would argue that the bear market HAS cleansed this space of a lot of garbage.

# A lot of the bad projects are down a ton

* HEX dropped 99%
* FTT dropped 99%
* Luna dropped 100%
* Algo dropped 96% \[yes, I count this one. It had 500%+ inflation in 2021. Sorry.\]
* Shib dropped 92%
* Doge dropped 93%
* A lot of the NFTs (like pictures of rocks or monkeys) are now $0
* All the other shitcoins that popped off earlier this year are also down a lot. PEPE dropped 79% from the high, for instance.

# A ton of bad actors have been removed from this space

* FTX is gone, taking a lot of bad actors with it, such as SBF and Caroline Ellison
* Do Kwon is gone
* The Celsius ponzi scheme died and with it Alex Mashinsky lost a lot of influence
* The Three Arrows Capital ponzi scheme died
* A lot of small exchanges died that mishandled user funds

Was the process of cleansing this space painful? For sure. RIP our portfolios.

Stalking a Scammer: A Game of Shitrugs,"It's been slightly less than a month since I made a reckless purchase of NUT, an event that led me to the discovery of an entire kingdom of shitcoin scams that is ongoing this very second. Since I busted that fateful NUT, I have found myself contacting exchanges, tracking quite literally thousands of Ethereum wallets, and even filing a report to the US Secret Service, all in an attempt to put an end to this serial scammer who I gave the nickname Shitrugger.

Most, if not all, of my attempts have proven to be a failure. I am waiting for a response from the Secret Service, but I doubt anything will come of it. The exchange Bybit at first gave me hope, as they responded to my email. But after sending tons of transaction hashes, they simply said they couldn't help. I was able to trace deposits and withdrawals from Binance as well, however I feel their hands are full at the moment and have not found the effort to contact them.

I have come to the conclusion that putting a stop to this scam is likely out of my range of abilities. I'm up to about **600 shitcoins** created in 3 weeks I've been able to track.  The number of trading wallets used to create fake trade volume I've found might be close to **10,000**. I've followed Shitrugger from Bybit, through Arbitrum bridges, and to Binance. Stopping this Dynasty of Shit could be done by one of these centralized exchanges, if they have KYC. But me? Me and my NUT? When it comes down to it, I don't even understand *how cryptocurrencies actually work.* If you look in my Google history, you'll find ""wat is a blockchan?"" in my recent searches.

But I have had a hell of a time following all this. I've learned a ton about Ethereum and that has spurred me to learn even more. Despite a likely failure in stopping Shitrugger, I'm still curious about the entire underworld surrounding shitcoin trading. So, I decided to take a gander at the sorts of folks buying Shitrugger's scam coins. My dear Moon farmers, let's see what I find:

https://preview.redd.it/hcju2910p35b1.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317554d2767f09eb50e9d765b57a6765f039c60c

This first picture is of the transaction history for GANG, just one of the shitcoins in a long line of shitcoins created by Shitrugger. The highlighted ""multicall"" is one of the functions of Shitrugger - it pretty much blacklists a trader's wallet so they are unable to sell. Here's the evidence of that:

https://preview.redd.it/7dns2nqip35b1.jpg?width=1208&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eeef3292830d66536bbe351915cf48343d13cff

Clicking that transaction and scrolling down until you can ""view more"" gets you to some of the raw data of the transaction. Hitting the ""decode"" button makes things a little clearer:

https://preview.redd.it/d2szy5hrp35b1.jpg?width=784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cf24dc0e1b9bfeb18cfe10e6fbdada08685253b

That there is the address of who made the trade. Lets just see what this particular trader has been up to:

https://preview.redd.it/08sb6c5xp35b1.jpg?width=1793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de873bb26e876bcac095c30f7571d6bdae918d93

Well, well, well. This chap seems to have been very lucky with an early PEPE purchase. Nearly $2.5 MILLION in PEPE, plus a metric fuckton of worthless shitcoins. I scrolled through most of their erc-20 tokens, and a good amount appear to be Shitrugger's product. Let's have a look at their most recent swap:

https://preview.redd.it/em4aicu4q35b1.jpg?width=1694&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8a5c0581783aa11399b7bb63ec905682113764

Following the top transaction from above, I found they had just bought a token called StarDAO. Sounds fishy. So I looked at StarDAO and wouldn't you know it, it had just been created, seeded with a suspiciously familiar amount of ETH. Shortly after, StarDAO rugged. Looks like I found another of Shitrugger's shitcoins, verified by backtracking until I found a link to previous Shitrugger coins using Arkham Intelligence. However, I noticed something odd:

https://preview.redd.it/5y0as1sjq35b1.jpg?width=1132&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78930dad2fd55cfaca9c3c732404a6325555908b

Notice above that there are zero ""multicall"" entries, but instead many ""approve"" entries. Looking into those, it appears they do the EXACT SAME THING - it blacklists the wallet when it attempts to trade. It seems Shitrugger has changed up the code a bit. What I did from here is wait to see if an ""approve"" transaction popped up that had a matching address to the PEPE millionaire. Well, there wasn't one, which means that PEPE Boy never tried to sell StarDAO before it rugged (which isn't surprising, it rugged 1 hour after creation). 

From here, I decided to look at one of the ""approve"" entries in order to see *who* just got blacklisted. I found something else odd:

https://preview.redd.it/lrw9dtbqq35b1.jpg?width=1761&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0731fbe8b6eb3b645918a5f9bf14e201925f9d3

The name of this address is **dimethyltryptamine.eth** and they have $2.7 million in PEPE - oddly close to PEPE Boy. They also have a metric fuckton of Shitrugger's tokens in their wallet, most of the same ones as PEPE Boy.

So what can be learned from all this? I'm still trying to sus it all out, but bottom line: Shitrugger is making a LOT of cash from these shitcoin traders, and shitcoin traders can easily afford to lose that money if just one coin takes off. If PEPE Boy spend $200 on each of the 101 shitcoins in their wallet, the cost basis overall is $20,200, but their profit is $2,395,026 because of that one PEPE swap. And with the similar amounts purchased by the two shitcoin traders, I can assume that there is a system to this shitcoin trading: spend a set amount on EVERYTHING NEW. Which also means that these scam projects will continue. Shitrugger is making a fuckton of money by volume of shitcoins created, shitcoin traders only need to get lucky once.

I'm fascinated by this culture, but it greatly depresses me as well. How much are ETH gas prices impacted by this? How can anyone look at crypto favorably while this takes place? Is there any way to stop this? For those who have followed my previous posts, I've discovered a very simple but large scale shitcoin operation, and I can only image what deeds are funded by this process. 

If anyone has any input/theories, please leave a comment. I'm swimming in a sea of shit here. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for another chapter in this saga. Not sure where I'm going with all this, but my recommendation to all of you is to avoid doing what these degens are doing. The odds of hitting the next PEPE are astronomically small, but the odds of hitting one of Shitrugger's spawn are nigh 99% if you are buying something brand new.

"This is a harsh lesson that we are facing still high inflation &amp; recession, a banking/monetary crisis that affects all markets and the difference between a real bull market and a bear market rally we had earlier this year","Earlier this year price shot up by almost 50%. There was a lot of celebrating and pronouncing of a new bull market. Some people call it out saying it was a bear market rally and there was a big difference. Then when prices cooled we had a big sh\*tcoin season when tokens like PEPE came from literally nowhere to gain nearly a 2 billion dollar market cap. Gas fees went ballistic and a lot of money went sloshing into these projects that mostly only made devs rich.

And within all of this, people seemed to forget that we are in the midst of a banking and liquidity crisis. Real estate prices are expected to take a massive dive with prices to fall at least 20% bare minimum. For all the negativity about banks, they are the core of money access and transfers. When they have huge issues like they do now, it is risk and emerging markets like crypto that take the biggest hits first.

And that's all nothing to say of the recession. The economy is only just barely above water because unemployment is still low, but the waves of layoffs keep coming. Europe has already fallen into recession, and who everyone expected to be the saviour as they are the  factory of the world in China have very weak economic figures and are actually lowering interest rates to try to resuscitate their economy. This is not to mention them having their own massive issues of a looming real estate and hence liquidity crisis on top of humongous youth unemployment.

Why and how Pepe got so hyped and popular?,"Why did Pepe and other meme coins experience such significant viral overselling? What factors contributed to their sudden surge in popularity and market demand? Additionally, I'm curious about the cost and intricate process involved in developing a cryptocurrency from inception to its successful launch.

If you were to embark on the journey of creating your own cryptocurrency independently and introducing it to the market, where would you begin? What are the essential steps involved in the development process, such as conceptualization, coding, testing, and marketing? Moreover, considering the resources and efforts required, what would be a reasonable investment range for such an undertaking?

The phenomenon of Pepe and other meme coins gaining widespread attention and being excessively bought and sold has intrigued many observers. It's fascinating to explore the reasons behind their viral success and the dynamics that drove their popularity to unprecedented heights. Similarly, understanding the intricacies of cryptocurrency development, including its technical aspects, financial considerations, and market strategies, can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that await aspiring creators.",1,0,2023-06-16 05:18:57,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION,"[('Hello, your post was removed because your account is less than 60 days old or you do not have the required 500 **comment** karma to make post submissions.', 1)]"

Pepe is soon to be out of Top 100 !,"

We all know what Pepe is we know how much it has caused average users to get rekt , we won't dwell on it. 

Plus we are seeing a lot of pepe whales selling at losses further pushing the price and sale pressure . 

Here are some stats suggesting that Pepe is soon to be out of Top 100 , good riddance. 

All time high - $0.00000420.   

Current price - 0.00000092. 

Percentage Down  (-78%) (-$ 0.00000328). 

1 Month Change  (-44.91%). 

1 Week Change  (-22.03%). 

 If it has to revist it's all time high it has to made 356.52% Gains which is roughly 3.65X current price. 

The Market cap has bleeded to $380 Million from their infamous $1 Billion in just months. 

I don't think it is a good idea to hold / buy this type of crap.

Why stop DCAing into ALTs?,"Trying to get my head around all the doom and gloom posts regarding ALTs.

Looking back on the last bear market, a lot of the top ALTs really didn't do much. Seems a bit like the dotcom boom in 1999 where you only needed to build a website, regardless of your core business, to get investor funds.

This time around, top ALTs, even the ALTs being attacked by the SEC look to be, for a lack of a better term, doing stuff. Many of the ALTs have continued to build/progress their roadmaps all through the boom and bust. They seem to be more business focused and have actual structure compared to coins that busted previously. They have been gaining partnerships with large non web3 corporates, and basically seem much better run.

So I'm just a bit confused why anyone already investing in one of most risky assets would feel they need to exit completely at a very large loss now compared to other large swings, or even when they ""invested"" in sh!tcoins like safemoon or Pepe..

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. DeFiLlama - The Swiss Army Knife of DeFi

Currently, there is no alternative data analytics platform available in the market that offers the same level of comprehensiveness while still being completely free.

With DeFiLlama, you can access every DeFi vertical (categories, unlocks, stables, volume) across almost every application today. It aims to offer insights into DeFi projects, such as total value locked (TVL), lending and borrowing statistics, trading volume, and more. Users can explore and analyze data from different DeFi platforms to gain a better understanding of the DeFi ecosystem. 

Along with other many useful features, there is also an Airdrop tab that has a list of tokenless projects that could potentially airdrop early adopters. You can sort by TVL and how much money has been raised for the project, which is super helpful.

# 2. Arkham Intelligence - Deanonoymizing the Blockchain

Arkham Intelligence is an amazing platform that enables users to scrutinize blockchain addresses, inspect both sides of a transaction, track fund movements and investigate counterparty connections.

Unlike its competitors, the platform organizes data by entity and tracks the flow of funds accordingly, deviating from the common practice of sorting things by token.  

From following scammers or tracking whales, Arkham has you covered with innovative features such as..

* Entity Page: Gain an all-encompassing view of the activities carried out by any entity or address.
* Visualizer: Witness the transformation of raw, complex blockchain transactions into easily understandable network maps.
* Dashboards: Curate and share personalized dashboards that capture the essence of these entities and addresses.
* Filtering: Filter and sort transactions across the platform, ensuring you only see what truly matters to you.
* Alerts: Stay ahead of the game by setting up custom alerts for both on-chain and off-chain activities.
* Explorer: Explore specific transaction details with ease and uncover the intricacies of the blockchain.

It currently requires an invite, but it is easy to find one if you search around. Or DM me, I have 7 left.

I was on my Phone scrolling through Twitter, and clicked on a what I thought was a legitimate coins website. It was claiming a free airdrop for “PEPE” holders. From there, it brought me to my Metamask and asked me to verify and sign. After this, the ETH was automatically stripped away.

Twitter: @pepecioneth

The word “coin” is spelt differently, my first mistake.

After this, I started looking into his wallet addresses (the two he dispersed the ETH into) are flagged for phishing. I found NFTs that he is holding right now, and traced it back to a Discord server called Satoshiverse. The username:

had the NFTs as their profile picture and banner. I have a solid feeling that this is his Discord.

"Lost $36,000 worth of ETH to a fake Pepe website. Please help","About 24 hours ago, I was a victim in a phishing incident which resulted me losing $36,000 worth of ETH. 

I was on my Phone scrolling through Twitter, and clicked on a what I thought was a legitimate coins website. It was claiming a free airdrop for “PEPE” holders. From there, it brought me to my Metamask and asked me to verify and sign. After this, the ETH was automatically stripped away.

Twitter: @pepecioneth

The word “coin” is spelt differently, my first mistake.

After this, I started looking into his wallet addresses (the two he dispersed the ETH into) are flagged for phishing. I found NFTs that he is holding right now, and traced it back to a Discord server called Satoshiverse. The username:

™®MåńtįšCåptåń112💣ČÂ|°T®#0545

had the NFTs as their profile picture and banner. I have a solid feeling that this is his Discord.

Other than that, I am lost. I am wondering if I can recover my funds or pursue this with an investigator. Please help.

Thank you

$236.14M of crypto assets were liquidated in the previous 24 hours! In which $190.60M were shorts and $45.54M were longs.,"Hi everyone,

Almost 2 Trillion PEPE Withdrawn From Binance; What's Happening?,[removed],1,0,2023-06-28 09:05:23,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS,[]
Shitcoin history - can we find out how that one moonshot happened?,"We all dream of the one moonshot shitcoin that will make us (for example) wife-changing money. For a while now, I've been trying to figure out exactly how some coins like Dogecoin or Pepe started their journey. 

What was the difference between PEPE and the other thousands of coins that just died? Was there that one reason in the beginning that made some people invest money? 

Let's face it: by the time we read about a coin in crypto 'news' or on this sub, it's already too late. No one who's heard about a coin on this sub is going to get rich from a $1k investment.

Did anyone follow the PEPE hype for example? What happened and where did these people find out about it? (I'm not talking about the later stage when it was too late).

Where people that got wrecked in NFTs by NFTs influencers said fuck you I\'m dumping your shit and buying this. If anything I think it was more a movement of people realizing the NFT grift and how they were taken advantage of.

"What coins would be included in an ""Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF?"" I'm asking because I think we really need one.","
I've been a part of this subreddit for a few years now and it has become clear to me that we, as a whole, are terrible at predicting successful projects. In years past, we have collectively praised NANO, LTC, VET, ALGO, EOS, BAT, ICX and countless other cryptos. Some of these did well, some did incredibly well for a bit, some did not do well at all.. 
However, some of the coins this sub has spent many posts completely shitting on have done amazingly well. These would include: SOL, PEPE, DOGE, BCH, SHIB, TRX and many others. 

How is it that we are so bad at this? What can we do to change??

I think an imaginary “Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF” would be a fun experiment to determine whether or not our brains are working against us. If we could put together a collection of the most hated coins in the sub, what would that look like? How would it perform? What do you think should be included in it? 

*Note: Before anyone jumps in to say “wHaT ABouT BTc anD ETh?!?” or something dumb like that: this post isn’t about those two. They aren’t part of this conversation.

Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.\n&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.\n&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.\n&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.\n&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].\n&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.\n&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.\n&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.\n&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Moon prizes are: 1st - 600, 2nd - 300, 3rd - 150, and Best Analysis - 500.\n\n&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:\n&gt; \n&gt; ## CONs\n&gt; \n&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it\'s the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it\'s often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin\'s native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that\'s just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can\'t be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It\'s impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum\'s account-based model compared to Bitcoin\'s and Cardano\'s UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum\'s Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):\n&gt; \n&gt; Ethereum\'s long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they\'re stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won\'t be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there\'s always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).\n&gt; \n&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):\n&gt; \n&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it\'s a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won\'t merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don\'t know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don\'t know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Final Word**\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\n*****\n\nWould you like to learn more?

Dogecoin’s Popularity Wanes As Rivals Emerge: What Next For DOGE?,"Dogecoin has been facing struggles as other memecoins gain popularity, causing a significant reduction in its investor community. Despite experiencing a 20 percent spike in value year-to-date, the digital currency has dropped by approximately 5.39 percent this week, trading at around $0.084 on Friday.

Other coins such as $PEPE and $WOJAK have emerged and contributed to the decline in Dogecoin's popularity. However, Dogecoin still maintains its position as one of the most traded and liquid digital assets, with around 5.4 million holders, according to on-chain data.

The market for Dogecoin is still dominated by whale traders, who execute large transactions worth millions of dollars. In the past 24 hours alone, several transactions involving millions of dollars have been processed on the Dogecoin chain, demonstrating the continued influence of whale traders on the market.

According to analysts, traders can expect an altcoin season in the near future, with mapped-out levels for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  Despite the challenges, Dogecoin remains a popular cryptocurrency, and its performance in the market will continue to be monitored by investors and traders alike.",1,0,2023-04-21 10:42:40,,dogecoin,,"[('Dogecoin has something I\'ve never experienced with other cryptos; a deeper purpose.

Reminds me of some of the early doggie coins from 2021 meme season (e.g. $FLOKI, $KISHU, $SHIBA, $HOKK, etc). Consolidating hard, sitting around a $5m MC, and the chart looks primed to moon.

UPDATE: I monitored on-chain data and found large PEPE holders are dumping for POOH. POOH (e.q. winnie the pooh) is coin that is a week old. Transactions included and other DD included.,"I shared graphics before, but here are specific transactions to reference.  

In monitoring PEPE's on chain data I realized some PEPE whales kept selling and loading up on POOH. **0xB69753c06BB5c366BE51E73bFc0cC2e3DC07E371.** Website is [pooh.money](https://pooh.money/) which links the contract.

I've now found 7 PEPE whales (over $1M holdings) all making buys into POOH. The buys are spread out over hours and relatively small ($2k - $15k per buy). The frequency of the buys over days makes me think the whales are trying to accumulate a large position.

If You were To buy a MEME COIN That had the Best Chance of 100x After this Whole PEPE Thing what one would it be and WHY?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my view Post yours also please.

Are you looking for a meme coin to invest in after the success of Pepe? Look no further than Bogdanoff, the latest meme coin taking the crypto world by storm. Here's why you should consider adding BOG to your portfolio:

Firstly, the creators of BOG are the infamous Bogdanoff twins, who are known for their cryptic predictions about the future of finance and their involvement in the crypto industry. Their involvement in BOG gives it a level of credibility and legitimacy that many other meme coins lack.

Secondly, BOG has a unique feature called ""liquidated locked,"" which means that a portion of the coins in circulation are locked away in a liquidity pool, ensuring that there is always a minimum value for BOG. This feature makes BOG less volatile than many other meme coins, which can experience sudden drops in value.

Lastly, BOG has an impressive score of 99 on Dextools, which is a platform that analyzes and tracks the performance of various cryptocurrencies. This high score indicates that BOG has a strong community, high liquidity, and is backed by reliable data.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a meme coin with a strong team behind it, unique features that make it less volatile, and impressive performance on Dextools, then BOG is definitely worth considering. So, why not invest in BOG and join the Bogdanoff hype train?",17,108,2023-05-04 19:39:16,,SatoshiStreetBets,YOLO 🤷,"[('[deleted]', 1), ('Not so subtle chill', 1), ('Catgirl coin.', 0), ('\\&gt; Firstly, the creators of BOG are the infamous Bogdanoff twins\n\nWhat?

Oi, long time lurker 'ere with multiple accounts, innit.

Didn't make as much as you 'oped, or missed a massive ROI from them low cap tokens? Well, 'ere's me plan to make £250,000 or more in the comin' weeks, so lend us your lug'oles!

PEPE - if you've already got it, probably best to 'old but I'd definitely leg it within the next 10-25X, if you ain't got it, were you asleep, blind, or bonking me missus? Anyroad, if you ain't got it, I'd probably not bother and focus on the rest of the post.
(0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933)

POOH - Right, this tubby little git 'as a MC of around 50 million and can and will likely get to at least 10-20X, if not more. I'd be lobbing in a few hundred quid, as many of the whales have recently flogged theirs.
(0xb69753c06bb5c366be51e73bfc0cc2e3dc07e371)

NOOT - Takin' on the persona of Pingu, which will likely give you the heebie-jeebies if you're in your 30s, this token is your best bet right now to avoid gettin' mugged off and make a tidy sum. With a MC of 6 million right now and the ability to easily hit 500 million in this meme/bull run warm-up, you could be seein' a 50-100X at least.
(0x04f518f4bd44c02255625f609bfbcbbf2d018089)

GARY - yeah, you 'eard me right, bleedin' Gary the snail from SpongeBob. This slimy git isn't even a day old and 'as a MC of around 0.7 million. This is one of the best ways to make a decent wodge of dosh right now. This coin has been poppin' up on low cap huntin' groups all day, so this is the early stage loads of you lot wish to find. This could easily provide a 100-500X. 'Ave at it.
(0x04f518f4bd44c02255625f609bfbcbbf2d018089)

PONK - this is meant to be Pepe's ape brother. All we know is like GARY, PONK is showin' up in the low cap huntin' groups, and with a MC of 1 million, you could be cashing out 100X dead easy.
(0x94f27f7c941ade2cae367a526d49a77bf7b8e134)

Now, 'ere's where the big brain stuff comes in.
You make some profits on the above, you might make anywhere from 10k-500k dependin' on how bonkers you are and how much you aped in.

You take some of that dosh and you bung it into...

SSB. Yep, SatoshiStreetBets Coin. This is the token that ain't even out yet. They 'ad Derpy Toshi, but tradin' was paused earlier this week, ready for a roll out of SSB in the next 7-14 days. If you think PEPE did a lot in a short time, your perception of reality is about to be shattered. None of the meme tokens you've seen had the might of r/SatoshiStreetBets behind it, other than 'olders postin' about it.

On top of that, their main utility token, SatoshiSwap, and its SSB.io platform (which rivals Dextools and eventually will trample all over Pancake and UniSwap) is goin' through their beta, which is openin' up to everyone next week.

Profiting from Memecoins vs. Building a Solid Crypto Portfolio for the Long Term,"With the recent meme season, we've seen how some people were able to make quick profit by buying and selling meme coins like PEPE. While it's great to see people making money in the crypto space, it's important to remember that investing in a meme coin is about having fun and not getting in with HODL mentality like we do for altcoins. 

Instead of investing in memecoins, it's better to focus on altcoins with utility. These projects have real-world applications and are more likely to hold their value over time. For example, Allianceblock and Polygon developed ZKPs, which enable decentralized identity solutions for the financial industry. Curve and Aave are coming up with new innovations that are pushing the boundaries of DeFi and helping to pave the way for a more decentralized financial system. These are practical and in-demand use cases for blockchain technology that has the potential for long-term growth.

Building a solid crypto portfolio with long-term holdings is a more sustainable strategy than chasing the latest meme trend. While it may take longer to see significant gains, investing in coins with real utility and a strong development team is a more reliable way to build wealth over time.

As we look toward the future of the crypto market, it's difficult to predict which area will be the next focus - Gamefi, Defi, or Metaverse. However, by building a diversified portfolio with strong long-term holdings, we can position ourselves to benefit from whatever trends come our way.

Meme Coin Investing 2.0: How Copium Crypto (COPE) is Disrupting the Traditional Crypto Market,"Hey everyone, have you heard about the Copium Crypto token (COPE)? It's the successor of the popular Pepe meme coin $PEPE. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, internal conflicts in $PEPE caused a fall in their market cap and a lot of investors were left disappointed. However, Copium Crypto is here to take the good parts of PEPE and improve on them for the benefit of small investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The message of Pepe will live on through COPE, but with the added potential for small investors to make it big. Unlike $PEPE, COPE has low transaction fees on the Binance Smart Chain, which is great news for those who have been put off by the enormous Ethereum transaction fees associated with $PEPE. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you're looking for the next generation of meme coins that will appeal to small investors and have the potential to make a big impact, then COPE is definitely worth checking out. Join the Copium Crypto community today and see what the hype is about!

Suggestion: One name per contract Address might reduce fraud in Crypto,"Confidence is the game, build confidence and see the crypto market boom because people will be willing to invest in crypto.

When you type in a certain token name on dextools, you will noticed that that same token will have different names but different contracts addresses.

I understand that in a smart contract, a token can only have one contract address, a dev can create multiple tokens with the same name but each tokens will be assigned a new and unique contract addresses everytime a new token is created.

As of today, contract addresses are the only ways to differentiate a token with the same name from another.

What if smart contracts are updated to make sure, tokens can only be assigned one name across chains just like the way a gmail username can only be assigned to one person, then we will have only one pepe, one satoshiswap, one shiba inu and one gary across all chains.

I think this new way of assigning names will give investors more trust and confidence to invest in a certain project and will reduce fraud by 90%.

This type of contract will also help in protecting Intellectual properties of crypto projects and will help restore confidence. Also projects will be afraid to rug pull because once they destroy the reputation of a certain IP,  the project is gone for good.

What do you guys think?",11,32,2023-05-11 07:57:56,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion 🦍,"[('Interesting idea! It would definitely be great to have more transparency and accountability in the crypto space.

Milady Meme Coin &amp; Pepe Coin Be Like 🔥🚀🌝,,0,1,2023-05-13 22:32:19,,SatoshiStreetBets,News 📰,"[('[removed]', 1)]"
COPE or PEPE: The Battle for Meme Coin Supremacy Continues,"Are you a crypto investor looking for the next big thing? Well, look no further than Copium Crypto (COPE), the successor token to Pepe meme coin ($PEPE). 

&amp;#x200B;

After internal conflicts within the $PEPE community caused a sharp decline in market cap, Copium Crypto was created to take the best aspects of $PEPE and improve upon them. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest advantages of COPE is the low transaction fees on the Binance Smart chain, making it accessible to small investors looking to make it big. This is unlike $PEPE, where the Ethereum transaction fees can be enormous and prohibitive for some investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

But fear not, COPE still maintains the same message and spirit as $PEPE, and is poised for huge growth potential in the crypto market. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why wait? Join the Copium Crypto community today and watch as this token takes over where $PEPE left off. Invest in COPE and take advantage of its low fees and high potential for market domination.

"$SWAP and $SSB Update - May 14, 2023","Hey gang,

We're back with an update!

[**SSB.io**](https://SSB.io) **Beta Has Begun**

We are excited to share some fantastic news with you all! The beta testing of our token-tracking, price-charting platform, [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) , has officially commenced. We are about a week and a half into this crucial phase, and the progress has been encouraging.

Our aspiration for [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) is not just to create another crypto tracking platform. We envision it as a thriving hub for crypto enthusiasts, where you can unearth the next high-performing tokens, participate in engaging AMA's, margin trade your favorite cryptocurrencies, and much more. We have a host of innovative features up our sleeves, and we can't wait to reveal them to you soon.

For the beta phase, we have launched the following features:

* Comprehensive ETH and BNB chain coverage
* Real-time price tracking
* Searchability of over 1 million tokens
* Compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices
* Daily highlights of top-performing and underperforming tokens
* A proprietary trending algorithm
* Lightweight trading chart alongside a full trading view chart
* Record of historical trades

https://reddit.com/link/13hmz2e/video/0slvs0lsvuza1/player

We recognize there is work to be done in perfecting the app (we are aware of the bugs). Still, we wanted to showcase our progress and allow the community to provide feedback through hands-on experience. Priority for invites has been given to our active Telegram group members, but rest assured, we'll be dispatching more invites over the coming fortnight as we refine the platform and prepare it for full-scale production.

We aim to offer a service on par with Dextools and beyond and then we'll dive into launching our unique features that no other platform currently has, as well as integrating the Satoshi Swap margin dex (next update on that coming later in the month).

Note - Dextools coin has surged approximately 500% since the year's start, which highlights the IMMENSE potential in the token tracking space. And don't forget, this is only one facet of our product suite, with leverage trading coming soon and further SWAP utility being integrated into [SSB.io](https://SSB.io). 

*Next invites are being sent out in a few days*

**$SSB Launch (SSB Coin) and Satoshi Street Bets Reboot**

It's meme season baby! Unless you've been living under a rock the past 2 weeks you can't help but have noticed that meme tokens are BOOMING. It started with PEPE and we also saw two different Wall Street Bets tokens blow up... and then the flood gates opened and the meme coin casino is back in action.

So... we are also thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of our official community meme token - $SSB, an integral part of the Satoshi Street Bets reboot! All DERPY holders (our previous meme token) will receive the equivalent dollar amount of $SSB automatically airdropped to their wallet, and everyone else will be able to buy in on launch. Here are the essential details:

* Launching this week
* No presale or whitelisting
* No artificial price inflation to benefit any party
* 0 transaction taxes. 0 reflections.
* Ethereum network deployment
* A fair launch on Uniswap, starting at DERPY's market cap before it was frozen
* All DERPY holders will receive a proportionate amount of tokens, with no extra supply creation

We've been working on an update to the SSB visuals for a while, along with a new mascot and this will be rolled out later this week. And then we'll start building the hype for $SSB and revealing the website and precise launch details! So stay tuned for more updates, including the precise launch details of $SSB and our new website!

We're going to be pushing $SSB ***very hard***, including using our biggest weapon, our email presale list of 35,000 people who signed up to the Satoshi Swap presale! This is an exciting time to be a part of Satoshi Street Bets and we'll be using this reboot to really take the community to the next level along with our meme token $SSB and our defi token $SWAP!

*Thank you for your support. Whilst you HODL we will BUIDL.*

The 10 Largest holders of the Milady meme token made a profit of $20 million,"According to Lookonchain experts, 10 addresses excluding exchanges and contract addresses own about 180 trillion LADYS, which is 20.3% of the total coin supply. 30.7 trillion tokens(3.5%)  are held by two wallets owned by market maker DWF Labs. 

DWF Labs sent 2.2 trillion Milady to exchanges, which caused a coin dump.   

According to on-chain data, the top three holders of Milady have already been blacklisted. One of them was also blocked by Pepe (people on the crypto streets suggested that the banned addresses are suspected of insider trading)               

Milady liquidity of approximately $3 million has now been spread across Uniswap v2 and v3. If the whales want to close their position, they must either take into account the huge slippage, or they will need to gradually sell their assets.",4,0,2023-05-17 07:49:13,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion 🦍,[]

"When the next bull market arrives, you all wont know","When the bull market arrives, no one will know, it will be very similar to what happened during the short lived meme season, when pepe pumped, people keep asking themselves if they were in a memecoin season, they didn't believe the pump so they missed the train until copy cats flooded the market and got pumped.

It takes just one token like pepe to start the next bull market, the fact is no one knows which token it will be, no one knows when the next bull market will start and for how long but all i know is that the next bull market will take the whole market by storm.

infact investors will ask if we are in a bull market, the reason is that they were programmed for only bear market, most people will be scared to invest until they get the hints,  by that time, most investors would have over looked lot of utility tokens and memecoins at lower market cap and will be left to either invest in rug pulls or if they are lucky invest in projects that are already at 50 to 100 million dollars marketcap.",28,61,2023-05-30 16:20:57,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion 🦍,"[(""For sure $SSB will be the right investment.

$PEPE is Ready to make Tendies only IF*,"So let me start with some classic dope things: this is NFA so DYOR, dance YMCA while singing BYOB, put your NASA suit, and don’t be a FED because I will call the FBI and CIA before going to MOON. 

Ok I think we are good to go. Let’s see how far my autism let me… never mind.  

An ERC-20 Token called $pepe was created on April 14th on the ETH blockchain with only 4 ETH of liquidity and it was well received by the crypto community + NFT community in matter of days in such a massive way that it brought the memecoin season to crypto by storm soaring over 4000x in only 19 days reaching 1.6B dollars of Marketcap. 

Ok that’s the relevant data because we ain’t looking for utility or any shit like that, this is not a security remember that, we only want the price goes up so we can pay our wife’s boyfriend trip to the Bahamas before summer ends. 

Pepe is not anymore a memecoin, is a “culture coin” and it can be compared only to Bitcoin (until it flips it). 

Warning: I can make a full explanation of why $pepe will be better than BTC, so don’t mess with me because you will dump every single asset to go all in on $pepe. 

*CURRENT $PEPE SITUATION* :

$pepe right now is taking his time to accumulate or whatever the fuck that means because BTC puked himself due to the villain of this year G.G (ifykyk, good game) BUT! that doesn’t mean anything to a frog that’s able to Jump really high, in fact the frogs can jump even 50 times their length (source: Internet) , and I think this calcule is kinda conservative due to the fact that this frog is the Giga Chad Frog of the internet, so, would be kinda retard think that this will act like a normal frog. 

*WHAT CAN YOU DO*

Buy $pepe and wait till you get rich. 

Bloomberg will never recommend this because I heard that Mike doesn’t like the frogs because when he was a kid one jumped on his face and that event was turned into a childhood trauma. 

*And now the IF*

$pepe will jump ONLY IF you start dumping the dog coins because at this point they are worthless, any influencer telling you to buy any dog coin is a scammer and you will be their exit liquidity, SO DO NOT DO IT. The last time Elon tweeted about doge the price didn’t even reacted, and that’s because Elon lost his dog magic sauce… But don’t forget that $Pepe is the most memeable THING in the world, and Elon loves memes and he knows that he needs to be really careful about his tweets because if he adds a frog, $pepe jumps 40%, just think about it.
