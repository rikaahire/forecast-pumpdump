UPDATE: I monitored on-chain data and found large PEPE holders are dumping for POOH. POOH (e.q. winnie the pooh) is coin that is a week old. Transactions included and other DD included.,"I shared graphics before, but here are specific transactions to reference.  

In monitoring PEPE's on chain data I realized some PEPE whales kept selling and loading up on POOH. **0xB69753c06BB5c366BE51E73bFc0cC2e3DC07E371.** Website is [pooh.money](https://pooh.money/) which links the contract.

I've now found 7 PEPE whales (over $1M holdings) all making buys into POOH. The buys are spread out over hours and relatively small ($2k - $15k per buy). The frequency of the buys over days makes me think the whales are trying to accumulate a large position.

This wallet has now accumulated almost 12% of supply over the past 4 days: [https://etherscan.io/token/0xb69753c06bb5c366be51e73bfc0cc2e3dc07e371#balances](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb69753c06bb5c366be51e73bfc0cc2e3dc07e371#balances)",6,4,2023-05-04 17:43:28,,SatoshiStreetBets,Due Diligence  üîç,"[('Seems to be a solid project, great community - check out twitter spaces‚Ä¶ bitmart listing coming soon', -6), ('![gif](giphy|j9mqKgQvkNOziGICfd|downsized)', 6), ('[removed]', 1), ('Bitmart listing: https://www.bitmart.com/trade/en-US?symbol=POOH_ETH&amp;layout=basic', 0)]"

If You were To buy a MEME COIN That had the Best Chance of 100x After this Whole PEPE Thing what one would it be and WHY?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my view Post yours also please.

Are you looking for a meme coin to invest in after the success of Pepe? Look no further than Bogdanoff, the latest meme coin taking the crypto world by storm. Here's why you should consider adding BOG to your portfolio:

Firstly, the creators of BOG are the infamous Bogdanoff twins, who are known for their cryptic predictions about the future of finance and their involvement in the crypto industry. Their involvement in BOG gives it a level of credibility and legitimacy that many other meme coins lack.

Secondly, BOG has a unique feature called ""liquidated locked,"" which means that a portion of the coins in circulation are locked away in a liquidity pool, ensuring that there is always a minimum value for BOG. This feature makes BOG less volatile than many other meme coins, which can experience sudden drops in value.

Lastly, BOG has an impressive score of 99 on Dextools, which is a platform that analyzes and tracks the performance of various cryptocurrencies. This high score indicates that BOG has a strong community, high liquidity, and is backed by reliable data.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a meme coin with a strong team behind it, unique features that make it less volatile, and impressive performance on Dextools, then BOG is definitely worth considering. So, why not invest in BOG and join the Bogdanoff hype train?",17,108,2023-05-04 19:39:16,,SatoshiStreetBets,YOLO ü§∑,"[('[deleted]', 1), ('Not so subtle chill', 1), ('Catgirl coin.', 0), ('\\&gt; Firstly, the creators of BOG are the infamous Bogdanoff twins\n\nWhat?

Oi, long time lurker 'ere with multiple accounts, innit.

Didn't make as much as you 'oped, or missed a massive ROI from them low cap tokens? Well, 'ere's me plan to make ¬£250,000 or more in the comin' weeks, so lend us your lug'oles!

PEPE - if you've already got it, probably best to 'old but I'd definitely leg it within the next 10-25X, if you ain't got it, were you asleep, blind, or bonking me missus? Anyroad, if you ain't got it, I'd probably not bother and focus on the rest of the post.
(0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933)

POOH - Right, this tubby little git 'as a MC of around 50 million and can and will likely get to at least 10-20X, if not more. I'd be lobbing in a few hundred quid, as many of the whales have recently flogged theirs.
(0xb69753c06bb5c366be51e73bfc0cc2e3dc07e371)

NOOT - Takin' on the persona of Pingu, which will likely give you the heebie-jeebies if you're in your 30s, this token is your best bet right now to avoid gettin' mugged off and make a tidy sum. With a MC of 6 million right now and the ability to easily hit 500 million in this meme/bull run warm-up, you could be seein' a 50-100X at least.
(0x04f518f4bd44c02255625f609bfbcbbf2d018089)

GARY - yeah, you 'eard me right, bleedin' Gary the snail from SpongeBob. This slimy git isn't even a day old and 'as a MC of around 0.7 million. This is one of the best ways to make a decent wodge of dosh right now. This coin has been poppin' up on low cap huntin' groups all day, so this is the early stage loads of you lot wish to find. This could easily provide a 100-500X. 'Ave at it.
(0x04f518f4bd44c02255625f609bfbcbbf2d018089)

PONK - this is meant to be Pepe's ape brother. All we know is like GARY, PONK is showin' up in the low cap huntin' groups, and with a MC of 1 million, you could be cashing out 100X dead easy.
(0x94f27f7c941ade2cae367a526d49a77bf7b8e134)

Now, 'ere's where the big brain stuff comes in.
You make some profits on the above, you might make anywhere from 10k-500k dependin' on how bonkers you are and how much you aped in.

You take some of that dosh and you bung it into...

SSB. Yep, SatoshiStreetBets Coin. This is the token that ain't even out yet. They 'ad Derpy Toshi, but tradin' was paused earlier this week, ready for a roll out of SSB in the next 7-14 days. If you think PEPE did a lot in a short time, your perception of reality is about to be shattered. None of the meme tokens you've seen had the might of r/SatoshiStreetBets behind it, other than 'olders postin' about it.

On top of that, their main utility token, SatoshiSwap, and its SSB.io platform (which rivals Dextools and eventually will trample all over Pancake and UniSwap) is goin' through their beta, which is openin' up to everyone next week.

Imagine takin' 2k profit from the tokens listed above and puttin' it into SSB on day 1...

Profiting from Memecoins vs. Building a Solid Crypto Portfolio for the Long Term,"With the recent meme season, we've seen how some people were able to make quick profit by buying and selling meme coins like PEPE. While it's great to see people making money in the crypto space, it's important to remember that investing in a meme coin is about having fun and not getting in with HODL mentality like we do for altcoins. 

Instead of investing in memecoins, it's better to focus on altcoins with utility. These projects have real-world applications and are more likely to hold their value over time. For example, Allianceblock and Polygon developed ZKPs, which enable decentralized identity solutions for the financial industry. Curve and Aave are coming up with new innovations that are pushing the boundaries of DeFi and helping to pave the way for a more decentralized financial system. These are practical and in-demand use cases for blockchain technology that has the potential for long-term growth.

Building a solid crypto portfolio with long-term holdings is a more sustainable strategy than chasing the latest meme trend. While it may take longer to see significant gains, investing in coins with real utility and a strong development team is a more reliable way to build wealth over time.

As we look toward the future of the crypto market, it's difficult to predict which area will be the next focus - Gamefi, Defi, or Metaverse. However, by building a diversified portfolio with strong long-term holdings, we can position ourselves to benefit from whatever trends come our way.

Meme Coin Investing 2.0: How Copium Crypto (COPE) is Disrupting the Traditional Crypto Market,"Hey everyone, have you heard about the Copium Crypto token (COPE)? It's the successor of the popular Pepe meme coin $PEPE. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, internal conflicts in $PEPE caused a fall in their market cap and a lot of investors were left disappointed. However, Copium Crypto is here to take the good parts of PEPE and improve on them for the benefit of small investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The message of Pepe will live on through COPE, but with the added potential for small investors to make it big. Unlike $PEPE, COPE has low transaction fees on the Binance Smart Chain, which is great news for those who have been put off by the enormous Ethereum transaction fees associated with $PEPE. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you're looking for the next generation of meme coins that will appeal to small investors and have the potential to make a big impact, then COPE is definitely worth checking out. Join the Copium Crypto community today and see what the hype is about!

Suggestion: One name per contract Address might reduce fraud in Crypto,"Confidence is the game, build confidence and see the crypto market boom because people will be willing to invest in crypto.

When you type in a certain token name on dextools, you will noticed that that same token will have different names but different contracts addresses.

I understand that in a smart contract, a token can only have one contract address, a dev can create multiple tokens with the same name but each tokens will be assigned a new and unique contract addresses everytime a new token is created.

As of today, contract addresses are the only ways to differentiate a token with the same name from another.

What if smart contracts are updated to make sure, tokens can only be assigned one name across chains just like the way a gmail username can only be assigned to one person, then we will have only one pepe, one satoshiswap, one shiba inu and one gary across all chains.

I think this new way of assigning names will give investors more trust and confidence to invest in a certain project and will reduce fraud by 90%.

This type of contract will also help in protecting Intellectual properties of crypto projects and will help restore confidence. Also projects will be afraid to rug pull because once they destroy the reputation of a certain IP,  the project is gone for good.

What do you guys think?",11,32,2023-05-11 07:57:56,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion ü¶ç,"[('Interesting idea!

Its first come, first serve, if a dev is the first to create a pepe token, then no other dev can create another pepe token, then it becomes the pepe token.\n\nBut what i see might happen is this, brands that owns popular memes IP might take up all their ip names on the blockchain and blacklist their own contract from trading.

Hence, the contract is trusted and is in fact, pepe.\n\nAbout the token name: Currently, we are agreeing to use ERC-20 Standard for fungible tokens.

COPE or PEPE: The Battle for Meme Coin Supremacy Continues,"Are you a crypto investor looking for the next big thing? Well, look no further than Copium Crypto (COPE), the successor token to Pepe meme coin ($PEPE). 

&amp;#x200B;

After internal conflicts within the $PEPE community caused a sharp decline in market cap, Copium Crypto was created to take the best aspects of $PEPE and improve upon them. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest advantages of COPE is the low transaction fees on the Binance Smart chain, making it accessible to small investors looking to make it big. This is unlike $PEPE, where the Ethereum transaction fees can be enormous and prohibitive for some investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

But fear not, COPE still maintains the same message and spirit as $PEPE, and is poised for huge growth potential in the crypto market. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why wait? Join the Copium Crypto community today and watch as this token takes over where $PEPE left off. Invest in COPE and take advantage of its low fees and high potential for market domination.

"$SWAP and $SSB Update - May 14, 2023","Hey gang,

We're back with an update!

[**SSB.io**](https://SSB.io) **Beta Has Begun**

We are excited to share some fantastic news with you all! The beta testing of our token-tracking, price-charting platform, [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) , has officially commenced. We are about a week and a half into this crucial phase, and the progress has been encouraging.

Our aspiration for [SSB.io](https://SSB.io) is not just to create another crypto tracking platform. We envision it as a thriving hub for crypto enthusiasts, where you can unearth the next high-performing tokens, participate in engaging AMA's, margin trade your favorite cryptocurrencies, and much more. We have a host of innovative features up our sleeves, and we can't wait to reveal them to you soon.

For the beta phase, we have launched the following features:

* Comprehensive ETH and BNB chain coverage
* Real-time price tracking
* Searchability of over 1 million tokens
* Compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices
* Daily highlights of top-performing and underperforming tokens
* A proprietary trending algorithm
* Lightweight trading chart alongside a full trading view chart
* Record of historical trades

https://reddit.com/link/13hmz2e/video/0slvs0lsvuza1/player

We recognize there is work to be done in perfecting the app (we are aware of the bugs). Still, we wanted to showcase our progress and allow the community to provide feedback through hands-on experience. Priority for invites has been given to our active Telegram group members, but rest assured, we'll be dispatching more invites over the coming fortnight as we refine the platform and prepare it for full-scale production.

We aim to offer a service on par with Dextools and beyond and then we'll dive into launching our unique features that no other platform currently has, as well as integrating the Satoshi Swap margin dex (next update on that coming later in the month).

Note - Dextools coin has surged approximately 500% since the year's start, which highlights the IMMENSE potential in the token tracking space. And don't forget, this is only one facet of our product suite, with leverage trading coming soon and further SWAP utility being integrated into [SSB.io](https://SSB.io). 

*Next invites are being sent out in a few days*

**$SSB Launch (SSB Coin) and Satoshi Street Bets Reboot**

It's meme season baby! Unless you've been living under a rock the past 2 weeks you can't help but have noticed that meme tokens are BOOMING. It started with PEPE and we also saw two different Wall Street Bets tokens blow up... and then the flood gates opened and the meme coin casino is back in action.

So... we are also thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of our official community meme token - $SSB, an integral part of the Satoshi Street Bets reboot! All DERPY holders (our previous meme token) will receive the equivalent dollar amount of $SSB automatically airdropped to their wallet, and everyone else will be able to buy in on launch. Here are the essential details:

* Launching this week
* No presale or whitelisting
* No artificial price inflation to benefit any party
* 0 transaction taxes. 0 reflections.
* Ethereum network deployment
* A fair launch on Uniswap, starting at DERPY's market cap before it was frozen
* All DERPY holders will receive a proportionate amount of tokens, with no extra supply creation

We've been working on an update to the SSB visuals for a while, along with a new mascot and this will be rolled out later this week. And then we'll start building the hype for $SSB and revealing the website and precise launch details! So stay tuned for more updates, including the precise launch details of $SSB and our new website!

We're going to be pushing $SSB ***very hard***, including using our biggest weapon, our email presale list of 35,000 people who signed up to the Satoshi Swap presale! This is an exciting time to be a part of Satoshi Street Bets and we'll be using this reboot to really take the community to the next level along with our meme token $SSB and our defi token $SWAP!

*Thank you for your support. Whilst you HODL we will BUIDL.*

The 10 Largest holders of the Milady meme token made a profit of $20 million,"According to Lookonchain experts, 10 addresses excluding exchanges and contract addresses own about 180 trillion LADYS, which is 20.3% of the total coin supply. 30.7 trillion tokens(3.5%)  are held by two wallets owned by market maker DWF Labs. 

DWF Labs sent 2.2 trillion Milady to exchanges, which caused a coin dump.   

According to on-chain data, the top three holders of Milady have already been blacklisted. One of them was also blocked by Pepe (people on the crypto streets suggested that the banned addresses are suspected of insider trading)               

Milady liquidity of approximately $3 million has now been spread across Uniswap v2 and v3.

$PEPE is Ready to make Tendies only IF*,"So let me start with some classic dope things: this is NFA so DYOR, dance YMCA while singing BYOB, put your NASA suit, and don‚Äôt be a FED because I will call the FBI and CIA before going to MOON. 

Ok I think we are good to go. Let‚Äôs see how far my autism let me‚Ä¶ never mind.  

An ERC-20 Token called $pepe was created on April 14th on the ETH blockchain with only 4 ETH of liquidity and it was well received by the crypto community + NFT community in matter of days in such a massive way that it brought the memecoin season to crypto by storm soaring over 4000x in only 19 days reaching 1.6B dollars of Marketcap. 

Ok that‚Äôs the relevant data because we ain‚Äôt looking for utility or any shit like that, this is not a security remember that, we only want the price goes up so we can pay our wife‚Äôs boyfriend trip to the Bahamas before summer ends. 

Pepe is not anymore a memecoin, is a ‚Äúculture coin‚Äù and it can be compared only to Bitcoin (until it flips it). 

Warning: I can make a full explanation of why $pepe will be better than BTC, so don‚Äôt mess with me because you will dump every single asset to go all in on $pepe. 

*CURRENT $PEPE SITUATION* :

$pepe right now is taking his time to accumulate or whatever the fuck that means because BTC puked himself due to the villain of this year G.G (ifykyk, good game) BUT! that doesn‚Äôt mean anything to a frog that‚Äôs able to Jump really high, in fact the frogs can jump even 50 times their length (source: Internet) , and I think this calcule is kinda conservative due to the fact that this frog is the Giga Chad Frog of the internet, so, would be kinda retard think that this will act like a normal frog. 

*WHAT CAN YOU DO*

Buy $pepe and wait till you get rich. 

Bloomberg will never recommend this because I heard that Mike doesn‚Äôt like the frogs because when he was a kid one jumped on his face and that event was turned into a childhood trauma. 

*And now the IF*

$pepe will jump ONLY IF you start dumping the dog coins because at this point they are worthless, any influencer telling you to buy any dog coin is a scammer and you will be their exit liquidity, SO DO NOT DO IT. The last time Elon tweeted about doge the price didn‚Äôt even reacted, and that‚Äôs because Elon lost his dog magic sauce‚Ä¶ But don‚Äôt forget that $Pepe is the most memeable THING in the world, and Elon loves memes and he knows that he needs to be really careful about his tweets because if he adds a frog, $pepe jumps 40%, just think about it.
