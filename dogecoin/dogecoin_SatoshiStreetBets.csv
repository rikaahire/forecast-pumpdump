Dogecoin has overtaken bitcoin in terms of the number of transactions,"The volume of transactions on the blockchain of Dogecoin has reached an ATH at 628,209, ahead of Bitcoin and Litecoin.

The  reason why transaction increased on the doge blockchain was because of traffic that came from several large addresses that made small transfers. One of these wallets sent 5766 transactions per day. 

In recent days, there has been unprecedented activity on the Dogecoin blockchain. According to DogeWhaleAlert, on May 11, an unknown person moved 13.07 million DOGE ($927,413) to several different addresses, spending $0.26 in fees. The transaction came after Elon Musk announced his resignation as CEO of Twitter.   

But despite the surge in dynamics, Doge price remained almost unchanged - over the past day, the coin has lost 1.1% in price",28,7,2023-05-16 10:34:41,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion ü¶ç,"[('I believe Elon fully intends to make Dogecoin into the world reserve currency', -3), ('[removed]', 1), ('This is hilarious', 8), ('10 million printed every day', 14), ('[removed]', 1), ('[removed]', 1), ('Hello and thank you for posting to satoshistreetbets!

"Unpopular opinion: If you are invested in a token with less than 100k in liquidity, you better sell","Do you realise that no token founded in 2020,2021 or even before 2020 whether utility or meme token have been able to break their ath since 2021.

Go to coingecko, type in your favorite token, you will realise that most of your favorite tokens haven't been able to break their ath, you can check shiba, safemoon, dogecoin, none have come close to their ath, since 2 years ago.

Now, there are many low cap tokens with very low liquidity, some of you are holding them, some has utility while some do not have, what are the chances that they will pump in the next bull market or users will use their utility?

Crypto marketing has become very expensive, you got influencers charging ridiculous fees for a tweet, marketing on social media platforms are also expensive. 

imagine a token with 20k liquidity, or 40k liquidity, what is the chances that it will pump in the next bull market? how many tokens can the team sell to create a marketing budget that can attract new buyers to pump the price up or use its utility especially with the 0% tax used nowadays to attract new investors.

Just because the token you hold with your dear life is 2 or 3 years old does not mean it will pump in a bull market even if it has an utility. Only projects with good liquidity and good budget for marketing will pump in the next bull market.

The truth is that many founders of low liquidity projects of 2020 and 2021 are already thinking of starting new projects in the next bull market.

If i was you, i would sell all my low liquidity tokens at loss or forget about them and prepare for the next bull market.",20,46,2023-06-19 09:50:22,,SatoshiStreetBets,Discussion ü¶ç,"[('What a stupid post.
