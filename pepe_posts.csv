"PEPE Meme Coin Rises Over 1,000% in 2 Days","It's that time of year again! Meme coin investors saw another coin register massive gains in a short period of time. PEPE, a meme coin that is based on the infamous pepe frog meme grew rapidly in popularity and hit new all-time high after all-time high.

The meme coin had started out the weekend with 10 zeroes in its price but by morning, it had been able to erase three zeroes from its price. In the course of this rally, the meme coin grew over 1,000% as its popularity spread across crypto Twitter.

During this time, its holder base grew from just a few hundred to almost 6,000. PEPE was also listed on Coinmarketcap in the early hours of Monday, another move that saw its price rally once more. Its trading volume also rose rapidly and has now crossed $35 million in a 24-hour period.

Join Bobo in his journey to defeat Pepe the Frog (30m market cap),[removed],2,1,2023-04-17 19:27:45,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS
Join Bobo in his journey to defeat Pepe the Frog (30m market cap),"Once upon a time, there were two cryptocurrencies named Bobo and Pepe. Pepe was an established coin with a market cap of 30 million, while Bobo was a newly launched coin that quickly rose to 500k in under an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Bobo was determined to become the Pepe killer and take over as the top cryptocurrency in the market. However, the coin faced setbacks when its developer disappeared after dumping his bags, leaving it on the verge of death.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the odds, the community rallied together and created a new Telegram group to revive the coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly but surely, Bobo began to regain its strength and make a name for itself in the crypto world.

&amp;#x200B;

With each step forward, Bobo became a more formidable opponent to Pepe. It was only a matter of time before Bobo became known as the Pepe killer, taking over as the top cryptocurrency in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, Bobo stands strong and proud, a testament to the power of community and determination. You can find Bobo at:

With the sentiment starting to be bullish again (we reached 69 on the Fear-and-Greed Index yesterday lol) the scams and shitcoins seem to be coming back again.

Today I saw somebody in a different sub shilling this ""new"" memecoin called pepe (like the frog meme) which promises to be the one memecoin to rule them all. It also promises to give an airdrop which should be absolutely huge like $ARB.

This so called ""memecoin killer"" is being shilled heavily by this Twitter account:

With a sketchy looking website, no real tokenomics and a supply looking like a phone number this is probably a scam sooner or later. I mean even on the website it says the coin is completely useless.

When meme coins and unknown sketchy projects start pumping like crazy it's good to exercise extreme caution.,"Currently several meme coins are trending and several of the meme coins that do absolutely nothing from the previous bullrun have also bubbled into the top 100 or floating near it. This is never a good sign, it means speculation is super high and that people are so confident they are betting on things that are worse than Safemoon and in some cases going all in.

Of course nobody can say what will happen next, but it's better to stick to your plan. With the economic forecast and consensus that we're pretty much headed for a recession (economic contraction); now would be the absolute worst time to be reckless and just yolo it all.

Again, nobody knows how deep or if we'll even be in a recession, but interest rates are still quite high and gambling as they say always benefits the house 99% of the time. I mean there's literally a trending coin called ' mcpepe's ' with a a pepe frog wearing a mcdonalds outfit. Nobody deserves to lose, but you make it seriously hard for people to empathize with you if you engage in stuff like that and it all goes belly up, stay safe.",15,44,2023-04-19 09:16:01,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

PEPE mooning + Meme coins - Exceed Caution,"
Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on the recent surge in popularity of meme coins, particularly PEPE. While it's exciting to see a coin go to the moon, it's important to exercise caution and do your due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency.

Meme coins like PEPE may seem fun and exciting, but they often lack the fundamentals that make a solid investment. They're typically created as a joke and don't have a real use case or value proposition. Instead, their value is largely driven by hype and speculation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't invest in meme coins if that's what you're into. Just be aware of the risks involved and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. And always remember to do your own research and make informed decisions.

So, if you're considering investing in PEPE or any other meme coin, make sure you understand what you're getting into. And remember, while it's fun to ride the hype train, it's important to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away by FOMO.",1,0,2023-04-19 12:39:05,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
PEPE Holder Turns $250 into $1M in Four Days. But Can They Sell It?,,2,42,2023-04-19 14:06:22,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS
Moonshot small-cap coin - price analysis based on Market Cap multiples,"Today, I encountered a very interesting post about PEPE coin - a new coin that emerged a few days ago.

Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe\_mooning\_meme\_coins\_exceed\_caution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12rrw0q/pepe_mooning_meme_coins_exceed_caution/)

Many people caught it early and made a multiple of their money.

In this post, I'll try to explain why you're most probably too late to do a 100000% return on it.

# Let's do some maths

The current market cap of PEPE is $100m as per: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/)

How much of a multiple can we expect?

Well, the largest meme coin out there (DOGE) has a market cap of $11b. I'll round it down to $10b.

So:

* If PEPE overtakes DOGE, it will do ""just"" a 100x. 
* If PEPE overtakes SHIB, it's a 50x.
* If PEPE reaches $1b market cap , it's a 10x.

So, is it worth it to throw $100 right now? Maybe it's a bit late - it's highly unlikely that it will overtake DOGE, and even if it did, you'll have $10k - not nearly enough even for a lambo, not to even speak about retiring early. 

On the other hand, I think it's realistic for PEPE to reach $200m or $300m market cap, which will 2-3x your money.

If you want to gamble, be my guest.

But you're not retiring from this. 

Exercise caution and be careful. Once a coin is mentioned on this sub, it's already too late.

"It seems like the guy who turned $27 into $1,000,000 with PEPE is a serial shitcoin trader and he started with a very large amount of money to exclusively trade shitcoins.","He bought 2.52T PEPE worth around $1,000,000 now, with 0.013 ETH around $25 at the time, which made him a 32,000X profit.

He has traded 3,000+ shitcoins in the past 2+ years and probably realized around $2M in profit. Here are partially profitable tokens.

[Screenshots by Lookonchain](https://preview.redd.it/hy457oul64va1.png?width=2630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f01ed80d93a317e7f17f3d858ccea51285e57f)

This guy bought MXS with 0.5 ETH in June 2021 and sold for 142.5 ETH in less than 30 mins.  Made a profit of 142 ETH ( 284x ).

Guys from Lookonchain noticed that he transferred in a total of 49,922 USDC and 677 ETH for trading, and transferred out 754,841 USDC and 1,167 ETH.  Currently holding 190 ETH.  So his realized profit is probably \~$2M (705K USDC and 680 ETH).

He basically throws shit at the wall and sees what will stick. He wasn't just 'lucky' like other people claimed over the last couple of days. He's just using a shotgun approach.

But it's also worth noting that he started with a large sum of money. Not everyone can afford to just throw nearly 50,000 USDC and 677 ETH into a meat grinder for shits and giggles and see what will stick.

Remember that next time you see another post about ""this X guy turned X amount into X millions"". His strategy paid off but it could also completely rekt his portfolio.

Edit: There's also some speculation on Twitter that he is an actual dev of this project and that's why he was able to buy early. Nobody else will be able to be so early, so it could be a Honeypot trap for other investors, and he will use them as exit liquidity but apart from a Honeypot Scan screenshot, I couldn't find more proof of that. So be careful when it comes to trading PEPE.",1269,527,2023-04-20 22:25:15,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

"Crypto Pragmatist: A bug, not a feature","**Jack Niewold**

***Founder,*** [***Crypto Pragmatist***](https://cryptopragmatist.com/)

April 20, 2023

About a week ago, I came across a new fundraising announcement today for a new crypto project. The project, led by a pseudonymous trader, had raised over $1m to build out a product based on what I think would be merely a feature in other industries. There‚Äôs no TAM, no true differentiator. ByBit or Binance could ship the same project as a small feature in a matter of weeks.

And, to be fair, even that million dollar round is relatively small as far DeFi goes. There are even crazier fundraising round for teams that I feel are building relatively simple features instead of companies and

And these founders and teams doing pretty well for themselves: paying teams of engineers salaries that would be unheard of in most countries, renting offices in the most expensive places in the world, buying themselves Macbook Pros and flying around the world to crypto conferences.

I‚Äôm not knocking that project itself; building and experimenting in crypto is important. This is just how the game works, and the VCs, founders, employees, angel investors, even retail investors. We‚Äôre all just playing the game.

**So what‚Äôs the problem?** Well, I‚Äôd argue that the problem is that the current paradigm in crypto is a great pressure for teams to create tokens over legitimately sustainable businesses.

And I think there‚Äôs a specific reason for this: **the whacky liquidity cycle in crypto.**

**‚Äã**

https://preview.redd.it/0qokd8dd45va1.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88bd2a5b85b873ecc00ff189a4e6051843346b64

Let me outline it here:

* It‚Äôs incredibly easy for teams to launch a token
* Investors want tokens they can speculate on more than actual products
* Tokens are more successful based on narrative than actual business success
* Teams and VCs focus on products that can launch a token over sustainable businesses
* Teams focus on tokens and tokenomics over products and business models
* Fewer sustainable projects and businesses get built in crypto

‚Äã  
‚Äã

**Crypto‚Äôs Dilemma**‚Äã  
‚Äã

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a rational investor or builder: the average time for a company to IPO is 8 to 10 years. That‚Äôs a long time: Ethereum is barely 10 years old. But most major coins wouldn‚Äôt have made it: Uniswap is just five years old, Binance Coin and Chainlink are both about six years old. All of the above mentioned have hit a market cap of over $20b: about the size of Robinhood and Coinbase **combined**.

And what enables this superfast cycle of liquidity? Tokens: a way to create liquidity for project founders and investors without going through two things:  
‚Äã

* The rigor of having to show professional investors why you‚Äôre worth investing in
* The regulatory hurdles of going through an IPO

‚Äã

In many cases, a project can use a token launch not as a liquidity event, allowing for collective ownership of a valuable asset, but for fundraising: raising capital to build what will hopefully *someday* be a valuable asset.

From there, it becomes more important to build a desirable token than a desirable product. As a castle in the sky is worth more than something rooted in real world multiples and businesses, it‚Äôs sometimes better to just make vapor.

People are still here for 100x-es more than DeFi products; just look at the success of memecoins like Pepe, Aped, Wojak, and a whole host of others that have had their moment in the spotlight. You simply can‚Äôt make a memecoin in the TradFi industry, it‚Äôs impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

[PEPE is the fourth biggest coin by volume, according to DexScreener](https://preview.redd.it/hevthmmi45va1.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b1d3e4a4b3c0b8bfca73fcf71ecccbc6fd34b4f)

&amp;#x200B;

**This whole concept of a quick liquidity cycle is a bug, not a feature.** DeFi should strive to do better. I don‚Äôt know what the solution is. Perhaps there isn‚Äôt one: but if we want the DeFi and crypto industry to grow into a real, mature industry, with projects bringing value to millions (billions) of people, we need to figure out how to deliver products, not tokens, into the hands of users.

"Crypto Banter, a YT channel with 621k subscribers, has been shilling PEPE all week - be careful out there.","YouTube channels are well known for using their followers as exit liquidity, and some of the best versed in this art form, are the crew of the YouTube series ""Crypto Banter"" , having shilled countless VC shitcoins before, throughout, and even after the previous bull market. 

https://preview.redd.it/3qj0sz44cbva1.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=955b9a8c736c0939a24184539d92dbb75cb6964e

This week, they have shamelessly shilled/mentioned PEPE coin several times to their over 1/2 a million followers, most likely causing countless noobs to invest in what could very well be a rug pull.

https://preview.redd.it/dy73pwv9cbva1.png?width=1271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0932dfd79ec3590bc19ee202cddbb7d083f595d0

Today, they hosted a panel - with the most notable guest being Raoul Paul, in which Ran Neuner, the host, name drops PEPE token several times, urging the participants to give their opinion. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSsjUAqGwM)

Fortunately, the guest in the bottom right had the sense to discourage investing in the token, saying it wasn't in her wheelhouse, and wouldn't be participating.

Throughout the week, they have shilled PEPE several other times - almost daily. I find this somewhat irresponsible.

https://preview.redd.it/iso2a4jpbbva1.png?width=233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d19a173b9b70f621e5685c8705befeeb29ed46

Having such a large following, and noticing PEPE so early into it's run - it almost seems as though their shilling of the token was a paid endorsement of some sort, as it is very seldom they would mention such a skeptical meme coin like this.

Personally, I aped a little into this early in the week and have had some pretty incredible gains - I've now taken profit and left my initial to ride the wave of shit. By the time CB was shilling, it was already nearing a dump.

I love meme coins, but I have 2 bull runs of experience in playing with shit. Always gamble responsibly, and always DYOR. I advise you all exercise extreme caution if the meme rally continues, with influencers ruthlessly shilling any old ass coin that runs.",39,64,2023-04-21 22:42:02,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

Recently we saw a brief meme coin pump. Leading the pump was $PEPE. Which is already down from ATH now. When $PEPE started gaining momentum other people wanted to capitalize on this so they made similar tokens that contained $Pepe in the name. 

One of those tokens was called Arbi Pepe.

What is the lesson here? STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN SHIT COINS. Simple... Also, there is a reason why people can't just 10x their money in a week. If it was easy everyone would be doing it already.  If you are up in these meme coins GET OUT NOW. You will get burned. 

When people say put most of your money in btc/eth I always see comments below that say why? This is why!

Let‚Äôs talk about memecoins,"When it comes to memecoins, the most notable ones are the two dog coins Doge and Shiba Inu, dominating much of the meme coin market share. 

Dogecoin is currently at a market cap of $10.97B (24h volume of $801,515,589) and Shiba Inu at $6.07B (24h volume of $196,515,589). With these two being at least $6B higher than other memecoins like Floki, Safemoon and the most recent one Pepe. 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

So let‚Äôs talk about **Doge V Shiba Inu**

*Utility*
Doge has gained significant interest from corporations and businesses such as Tesla, AirBaltic, Twitch and more, incorporating direct payments in doge hence helping to strengthen its utility. 

Shiba Inu on the other hand hopes to strengthen its utility via other means such as the dex ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Metaverse, games and Shibarium. 

Shiba also has utility in payments with companies such as GameStop, Petco and Nordstrom. 

**On-Chain Data**

Data indicates that Shiba has had a range of 3,900 to 12,000 daily active addresses this year, spiking to a number of 36,000 address at the end of March this year. 

Doge‚Äôs active daily addresses has constantly been significantly higher, ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 with spikes ranging between 90,000 and 100,000. 

This difference indicates that Doge has a greater network activity and adoption compared to Shiba. The reason for this could be the support from celebrities and billionaires. 


While dogecoin has been at the front of all memecoins, the possibility of Shiba Inu surpassing doge in market capitalisation can not be dismissed. The reasoning being due to its strong community support and diverse use cases. Shibarium is also expected to enhance its utility and adoption. Furthermore, token burns have also been explored by the community to support shiba‚Äôs price.",5,90,2023-04-22 04:49:30,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

The first thing i noticed was suspiciously high amount of money ""ppl"" are throwing into 1 day old shitcoin. Other sus thing is that a number of transactions is multiple times higher than number of makers, also number of holders was sub 1k at that time. Ah right, and obvious periodical dumping. Funny thing is fake volume wasn't even frequent enough to cause changes of price in last hour.

over 2 years old wallet, we might be getting somewhere, i won't we looking at 2 years of activity because i'm too lazy. Let's just take a look at april, we can see funds withdrew from Bybit and then sent do previous wallet. There are also some funds sent to binance wallet, probably to some non KYC exchange that uses Binance wallet. we can also see new wallet here so let's take a look at 0x4481d1132def12724b07d4bade683ec049a72930

"During the past days we have seen how many shitcoins were pumping, but this also historically has represented the end of a Crypto rally.","The price action of the bigger Crypto assets like, BTC and ETH, has been mostly muted or heavily to the downside for the past days and even weeks, while some other Cryptos have been pumping as if we are in the middle of a bull market. I think we all have seen that happen with shitcoins like PEPE and also others like AIDOGE.

New Airdrop for ARB recipients: REKT,"This one isn‚Äôt worth a whole lot right now and was dropped this afternoon (5:00 PM UTC).

If you were fortunate enough to receive the ARB airdrop, your wallet address is eligible to receive the REKT airdrop.  I got about 800 ARB and the REKT drop netted me about 5 dollars.  However, given the success of the PEPE drop, we could get a decent multiplier with REKT.  That being said I would not spend anything other than the gas (about 50 cents in ETH) to claim REKT.  

There is no wallet checker so I would advise moving your moons to another address if that is the one that was used to claim the ARB airdrop and / or connecting a burner address to the website before checking your eligibility.

Bear Market Reminder: Beware of Investing in Meme Coins and Shady Projects like $PEPE - Do Your Research!,"As we navigate through a bear market in the cryptocurrency world, it's important to remind ourselves of the risks associated with investing in meme coins and shady projects like $PEPE.

During times of uncertainty, it can be tempting to seek out quick gains and overlook warning signs. However, it's crucial to exercise caution and do thorough research before investing your hard-earned money.

Many meme coins and questionable projects have been used as cover-ups for scams, where investors lose their funds. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it's essential to research the project team, their track record, and the project's potential before investing.

Remember, cryptocurrency investing is highly speculative, and there are no guarantees of profits. Don't be fooled by promises of high returns with minimal effort, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

In short, as we weather this bear market, let's remember to take a cautious approach to investing in $PEPE or any other meme coins or questionable projects. Take the time to do your research, make informed decisions, and protect your financial security.",0,38,2023-04-23 10:21:10,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE
"People never learn, and never will","I'm sure some of you are already familiar with it from the other post, but basically the success of the PEPE coin is currently giving birth to a lot of scammy off-shoots like BABYPEPE and others. 

BABYPEPE rugged yesterday and I'm sure that more will continue to rug. Even in a bear market, where arguably the only thing you need to do to have decent profits a bit further down the line is DCA into real assets, people are still looking for a get rich quick scheme.

No matter how good the opportunity is (and I believe the current market will make a lot of people well off in a matter of years) people's greed demands instant x100 profits. Regulation will have to happen because scammers and idiots are just too busy getting in business together all the time. 

What do you think? Will people eventually be educated enough not to fall for this, or is regulation the only thing that'll put an end to the countless rugs that we keep see-ing? And if regulation is the answer, how do we ensure that decentralised systems remain decentralised?",28,173,2023-04-23 14:21:42,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Does anybody else hate what shitcoins are doing to crypto's reputation?,"I love the tech behind crypto and seeing what innovations come out of the space. But every time we go through a ""meme coin phase"" like we are right now where the front page of the subreddit is full of ""pepe"" and ""baby pepe"" and ""elon pepe"" and ""shiba inu doge kermit pepe"" it really changes the way I feel. And don't get me started on ridiculous NFT collections.

I get that we're still early and maybe it's just part of the ""growing pains"" that happen on the way to mass adoption, but I hate the way it makes us look. I hated how during the last bull run, whenever crypto made the news they always made sure to point out Doge to make crypto look like a joke. I hate how right now as we're in the middle of a big regulation battle in the US and abroad, there's an absolute avalanche of shitcoin rug pulls that do nothing but give regulators more ammunition for arguing that crypto should be heavily regulated.

I get it, it's funny to see a coin called GENSLR go up 15x while Gary Gensler is being grilled in a hearing, but at what point to we grow up and realize that maybe this shit needs to stop if we want this to go anywhere. And I know that it's two different ""worlds"" within crypto, the serious projects and the shit, but outsiders don't see it that way. To them, SHIB and BTC might as well be the same coin because they don't understand the intricacies of this space.

I know the majority of us are not buying into this shit (I hope) and we're just watching from the sidelines, but still, it doesn't help when we give it airtime. I hope one day these shitcoins die and we can put all our efforts towards innovating and improving to attract the masses rather than giving them reasons to stay away.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Funny but could be worth it.,"I read a discussion thread today on how some random meme coins are trending and some were of the opinion that Shiba Inu will be seeing strong competitors in the nearest future.

I don't mean to be sarcastic but some of these projects names sounds funny. Aidoge sounds like a good name tho  but the likes of Pepe and particularly Rekt is funny but interestingly all are very bullish atm.

These projects also has Arbitrum to thank cos obviously it's platforms played the role in bringing them to prominence and it ultimately rewarded it users cos the airdrop is exclusive to those who claimed Arb airdrop. 

Meme has not been my type but these three sounds tempting and yet not available on either Kraken, Binance and Coinbase except on MEXC and Bitget.

Pepe will end up like Grumpy Cat for the same reason..,"If you don't know the story of Grumpy Cat, it was a super hot shitcoin last bull run. It's claim to fame of course was that it was built on a solid meme that stood the test of time.  Whenever you bought or traded grumpy it set some aside to be donated to animals iirc. Shit was absolutely chuggin along. 

But it turns out that grumpy cat was a registered trademark. And the owner of grumpy cat sent a cease and desist to the CEXs that were carrying it. They dropped it. CMC dropped it. Then it was rugged. And the community scrambled for anything to recover their bags. Several factions split off including the noble PAWTH, a bunch of discord drama blah blah and nobody made anything back. 

Now you may be familiar with the controversy over the pepe meme. A bunch 4chan knuckle draggers turned it into a hate symbol to own the libs or something in 2016. What you may not know though is that as a response the creator trademarked it. And sued several people for its use including the daily stormer and infowars. A pepe game was rejected from the apple store even based upon it being a hate symbol. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog

Needless to say it's pretty easy to see where this is all going. It's highly likely it will be blacklisted by CEXs either for being a hate symbol or for being trademarked or both.",10,69,2023-04-24 00:35:43,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Pepe meme coin down over 16%,[deleted],0,139,2023-04-24 07:19:59,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
Pepe meme coin down over 16%,"The cryptocurrency market has recently been rocked by the sudden and dramatic drop of the popular Pepe Meme Coin (PEPE). The digital currency, inspired by the well-known internet meme character, has plummeted by nearly 20% overnight, leaving investors and market analysts scrambling to make sense of the rapid decline. The sudden drop in the value of Pepe Meme Coin has raised suspicions of a rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation. This article will examine these factors and discuss their potential impact on the future of PEPE and other meme coins.

Rug Pull
A rug pull is a type of exit scam in the cryptocurrency world where developers or project owners abruptly withdraw their funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. The rapid decline of Pepe Meme Coin's value has led to speculation that a rug pull could be responsible for the sudden drop. While it is challenging to determine whether a rug pull has occurred, investors should be cautious when investing in newer and lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as they may be more susceptible to exit scams.

Bot-Pumping on r/cryptocurrency
Another factor potentially contributing to the sudden decline in PEPE's value is the recent bot-pumping on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. In the past week, numerous bot accounts have been promoting Pepe Meme Coin, artificially inflating the perceived popularity and value of the digital asset. This coordinated effort to manipulate market sentiment can lead to unsustainable price increases, followed by a rapid decline when the manipulation is exposed or comes to an end. It is crucial for investors to be aware of such deceptive practices and to thoroughly research any cryptocurrency they are considering investing in.

Market Manipulation
The cryptocurrency market, particularly for smaller and less established tokens like Pepe Meme Coin, remains susceptible to price manipulation by large investors or ""whales."" These entities can use their substantial holdings to artificially inflate or deflate the price of a digital asset, often to their own advantage. The suddenness and severity of PEPE's drop in value raise suspicions of market manipulation. Investors should remain vigilant about the potential for manipulation in the cryptocurrency market and carefully consider the risks associated with investing in less established digital assets.

Conclusion

The dramatic overnight drop in Pepe Meme Coin's value serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, especially those based on memes or other ephemeral internet phenomena. The suspected rug pull, bot-pumping on r/cryptocurrency, and market manipulation highlight the need for investors to stay informed, conduct thorough research, and approach the market with caution.

While the future of Pepe Meme Coin and other meme-based cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the world of digital assets is as unpredictable as ever. As such, investors should be prepared for unexpected shifts in value and exercise caution when investing in lesser-known tokens.",1,1,2023-04-24 07:19:59,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

* The blacklist function is included. Some addresses may not be able to trade normally.

Dynamic NFTs ‚Äì The Next Bullrun Hype?,"Are Dynamic NFTs the next Cryptohype or is it just a niche that is not taken into ac-count?

Is it worth to invest now in the first Dynamic NFTs?

&amp;#x200B;

# So first lets take a look what are Dynamic NFTs

Dynamic NFTs are non-fungible tokens whose metadata and visual representation can change under certain circumstances, while static NFTs are immutable and retain their visual and content characteristics regardless of who owns them or how often they are traded.

# How a dynamic NFT works

Dynamic NFTs operate on the basis of smart contracts created on a blockchain plat-form, such as Ethereum. These smart contracts are programmable contracts that are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. **In the case of dynamic NFTs, these conditions are often associated with the modification of visual or content characteristics of the NFT.**

**Some examples of practical use cases of dynamic NFTs are:**

**1.** NFTs that change based on real-time data, such as weather, stock prices, or social networks.

**2.** Collectible cards or blockchain gaming items that can be upgraded or customized over time.

**3.** Digital pets or avatars that respond to their owners' interactions and evolve ac-cordingly.

**4.** NFTs that serve as access tokens to exclusive content or events and whose design

changes according to the number of events attended.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, dynamic NFTs can thus provide a more engaging and personalizable experience

for users by providing unique and changing content that can respond to its owners

and its environment.

# What Crypto Projects Already Using Dynamic NFTs?

**Adidas:**

Adidas is one of the most well-known companies that has one of the largest NFT projects,

the Adidas ALTS NFT collection, which has dynamic properties. Adidas ALTS

NFTs serve as digital identities and avatars for their owners within the Adidas metaverse.

They provide access to exclusive content, events and benefits that are only

available to holders of these NFTs.

[https://opensea.io/collection/alts-by-adidas](https://opensea.io/collection/alts-by-adidas)

&amp;#x200B;

**Polymorphs**

Polymorphs is another project that features its unique feature scrambling system and

works with NFTs with dynamic properties. The Polymorphs NFT collection consists of

constantly changing NFTs that can be altered in different ways by their owners. Owners

can remix the DNA of their Polymorphs NFT to change its appearance, including

clothing and wearable items.

[https://opensea.io/collection/polymorphs](https://opensea.io/collection/polymorphs)

&amp;#x200B;

**Moonbirds**

Moonbirds introduced a dynamic in December 2022 by allowing collectors to activate

new backgrounds. This aesthetic is stored in the Moonbirds Smart Contract, so any

updates or additions happen directly on the blockchain.

[https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pepethereum**

Pepethereum presents dynamic ‚ÄûOn-Chain-Pepes‚Äú that interact with the Ethereum

network. These NFTs automatically adjust Pepes smile to the ETH price by tracking

Uniswap pool data directly from the blockchain.

Unique traits

No two frogs are the same. The pastel shades of each trait are created by hashing

the trait id and token id then converting the hash to an hsl color code.

Note that this is not associated with the official Pepe. This is a eth/usdc price indicator

that is paying homage to the popular meme in a unique way.

[https://pepethereum.com/](https://pepethereum.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Static NFTs, which guarantee that an NFT will have the same properties forever, are

interesting because of their immutability and valuable to many collectors for that very

reason. Nevertheless, it seems likely that more and more dynamic NFTs will come

onto the market in the future, as they can fundamentally extend the functions of

NFTs. Especially for brands that want to create personalized user experiences for

their customers, dynamic NFTs offer significantly more design possibilities than static

ones. It will be exciting to see how today's pioneers in this sector experiment with dynamic

NFTs in the coming months. Especially in the blockchain gaming sector, dynamic

NFTS are likely to play an increasingly important role.",1,0,2023-04-25 12:35:07,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Floki Inu‚Äôs Listing Skyrockets Price,"
After the euphoria subsided, the price retraced from $0.000046 to $0.000037 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin reached an intraday high of $0.000048.


The FLOKI team argued that the launch of Binance.US deposits endorsed the project and consummated a meme coin trilogy consisting of DOGE and SHIB. Binance.US listed FLOKI and announced USD and USDT spot trading pairs for the coin on Tuesday.

The move will likely result in bad blood with the Tamadoge (TAMA) community, whose token fell 30% after the announcement that Bybit would list the token rather than Binance or its U.S. arm.

Listings boost the credibility of even well-known coins. Floki Inu joins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the only other dog-themed coins on trusted exchanges. Tamadoge, PEPE, and BabyDoge have yet to secure credible listings.

FLOKI‚Äôs listing on Binance.US, which is the American branch of Binance, is significant because of Binance.US‚Äô large trading volumes. FLOKI can gain visibility and, more importantly, credibility, given the difficulty of getting a Binance or Binance.US listing. Securing Coinbase and Binance listings seem to be the project‚Äôs next goal.
After the listing announcement, the token entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. This ascent marked a significant achievement for the project‚Äôs team and backers. The coin‚Äôs market cap has since fallen to 116.",1,0,2023-04-25 16:56:49,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

Bitcoin millionaires and lost treasures in long forgotten wallets flood the crypto ethos like urban legends and bring new blood, and new funds to the space daily.  Like miners panning for gold people from all walks of life flood the crypto space and provide fuel for market and make great targets for the well equipped scammer and the next rug pull. 

Like walking into a casino after having  read one book on how to play poker, then getting eyes drawn to the new high tech slot machines individuals are quickly reminded of P.T. Barnum‚Äôs quote, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a sucker born every minute,‚Äù as they attempt to explain to their families where the Christmas bonus went. 

Dejected and dismayed they vow unwittingly to get the money back and then some. After all they‚Äôve heard Pepe is the new Doge and the old Doge is about to do it again. All they need to do is swap they current bags and Hodl and in time they‚Äôll moon,  right? Or at least that‚Äôs what the latest YouTube guru says as they point out ‚Äúlife changing gains.‚Äù 

Is it real? I‚Äôm of the belief that 90% or more of the recognized ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù have had way more going for them besides a dollar and a dream. Things like exposure to market, ability to read charts, above average financial literacy and a decent financial cushion certainly have allot to do with so called ‚Äúovernight successes.‚Äù Rags to riches stories are enticing however. How many have hodled while they watched their dream come true then crash into oblivion? Sucked in by community hype and under the illusion that the superior tech was going to take their coin to the next level those who don‚Äôt know what volatility really means are destined to find out.
There‚Äôs a learning curve to anything worthwhile. Education is rarely free. It demands to be paid for one way or the other. Exchange fees, transfer fees, gas fees, transaction, fees, and taxes take the poor man for a ride, and by the time all is said, and done how much better off were they?

I suppose it‚Äôs more of a question than a statement. Because I‚Äôd love to hear about the natural fortunate, genuine, lucky, crypto millionaire.  I believe it‚Äôs possible, but is it really probable?",3,75,2023-04-26 21:50:02,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
"Need 20x by 2025, what are your thoughts?","Started with $50k last month.  Portfolio breakdown is:

50% BTC
10% ETH
20% DOGE
10% SOL
10% PEPE

Rate my portfolio, what would you add? Going to be DCA another $10k or so over the next 3-6 months.  Would you expect a 20x overall return by 2025 even if one of these goes bust? I feel like 20x would be conservative and would hope for closer to 50x.  If that‚Äôs the case should I reallocate or just start investing in more alt coins throughout the year

Should I also scrap BTC because realistically from here we will probably only see a 3x

I've seen this many, many times. I can't fathom why someone would trade ten bucks for less than a nickel. At first, I get it. That dime is burning a hole in your pocket, why not yolo it into a shitcoin and see if it becomes a cool billion bucks? So you fork over that silver Roosevelt plus a pair of Lincoln's because it's Eth. After what feels like an eternity, but in reality is only 2 hours, you realize your investment has now plummeting, and you have 4/5ths of a nickel. So you fork over another couple Lincoln's and boom, you are free of your shitcoins *and* 0.01 Eth.

This makes zero sense to me. You have to confirm the transaction. Whose looking at that gas fee and thinking ""YES, PLEASE, I would rather be -$10 than +.04""? No one out there is harvesting a sub-one dollar tax loss. There is no reason that this kind of trade should ever take place. Even if this person bought the tippy tippy top of the Pepe bump, max they'd have spent is a *dime*.

Creating A Meme Coin: Jerry Springer Pepe,"As an exercise in understanding crypto more, I was thinking about building a meme coin. Of course, the important thing is to have a strong coin name.  But I am wondering if others believe there are essentially ""rules"" to building a cussessful meme coin. Here is my list of important steps and essential components,  as I've determined them from projects and coins I've been in over the recent years:

- Recognizable name. This is obvious. You need something people can quickly refer to that people will be interested in.

- Tokenomics. I know that coins with any kind tokenomics have fallen quickly out of favor these last 18 months. Wondering if there are any new thoughts on the best way to manage token economics now beyond the obvious tax/no tax models.

- Blockchains. A huge ton of meme coins launched on BNB mostly because their gas fees are so low. But of course, a ton of meme coins exist on ETH chain as well with their higher gas fees. I am wondering if it is time to think about starting mem coins on other, perhaps newer chains. Ideas?

- Launch and Funding- I have seen a lot of newer mechanisms for coin luanches now. Lots of launchpads and more. What is the best thoughts on perhaps launching a meme coin without the need to consider doing lots of development based on functionality.

What do you all think?  Any other major items I am missing here?",2,78,2023-04-28 00:02:26,,CryptoCurrency,NEW-COIN

Once upon a time in crypto land.... (part 1 - intro),"There was a little guy named pepe.  He saw bitcoin crash and thought ""wow, that looks cheap, it'll go down more""

He waited and waited, but nothing happened.  Perplexed he went about his daily business until one day, he checked his binance app and low and behold, bitcoin had risen in price.

""It can't be, it'll definitely go down more, it's just a blip""

Sure enough a few more days passed and he checked again.  It had gone up again!

""Fark"" he said. ""I could have got that really cheap.  It was 15k when I thought it would go down more, and now it's 28k! I could have doubled my money!""

He decided to wait again, sure that bitcoin would eventually resume it's downtrend.

A few months passed.  He'd been busy so hadn't been looking at the price much or really paying attention to it.  One day he woke up early and remembered that bitcoin was supposed to drop like he thought.  

He got excited! It had been a couple of months, ""it must be in the toilet now he thought.  I'm going to buy cheap bitcoin and be rich!""

He reached over to his bedside table and grabbed his phone and pulled up a weekly bitcoin usd chart on binance.  The dollar had started to weaken, and btc had started a huge run.  He looked at the price at the top of his screen.

""100,000 usd per BTC""

""I knew this day would come!""

&amp;#x200B;

**(1)** Let's start with a real banger! Our boi Greg bought 1700 BTC @ 6 Cents and sold em for 30 Cents. We can't blame him - profits are profits.

You hear about how PEPE coin made a kid $1 Million with their $27 Investment but you don't hear about people losing lifesaving in others Everyday,"Recently I'm seeing this PEPE coin  trend all over the Internet, even on this sub I've seen a overflow of pepe coin posts past 2 weeks, media is also posting so many articles all day long about this coin which is making many people fomo in and lose money. 

I know it's very tempting when you hear about some shitcoins pumping 10x in a week all over social media and news sites but MOST of the time it's already too late to invest, so many news sites get paid to post about these shitcoins to lure more people in, devs and whales spend alot of money on hyping these projects. People fomo in and invest big in these projects meanwhile devs and early investors keep dumping on you with so many private wallets they bought from early on. 

There are the people who would join crypto, gamble away money on these hyped up shitcoins, lose money and then go cry outloud on the streets that crypto is a scam.Don't be those guys.


Now I'm not saying all the shitcoins have bad devs or intentions but  this is the case with 99.99% shitcoins. 

Media don't report on how many rugpulls happens everyday in this space, so many people lose shitload of money every single day in shitcoin world but most of those are not reported by media. 

This post isn't against any particular meme or shitcoin, it's only to warn my fellow CC sub family not to fomo in shitcoins because of all the hype and be very cautious.

Think of shitcoins as a lottery ticket, your chances of winning it are very low, it's pure gamble, your investment can go to 0 instead of going to the moon.

A ""mysterious"" PEPE whale was found to have sold a significant portion of the token's supply. The individual has sold approximately 800 billion PEPE tokens, which equates to 14% of the entire PEPE supply. This has led to speculation that the whale in question could potentially be a developer involved with the project.

According to data gathered by Lookonchain, the Pepe whale has been strategically selling off their tokens whenever the price of PEPE increases. Just recently, the individual sold 100 billion PEPE tokens for 21 ETH (equivalent to $40,000) at a price of $0.0000004007 per token.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the mysterious seller has accumulated 117 ETH (worth approximately $221,500) from their token sales, with an average selling price of $0.0000002744 per PEPE.

The fact that this whale has been systematically offloading their tokens has fueled speculations that they could be a developer or someone closely associated with the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it is possible that the mysterious Pepe whale is simply an investor with a large holding who is taking advantage of price movements to maximize their profits.

The whale's wallet ENS is dimethyltryptamine.eth, apparently [@rodeorambler](https://twitter.com/rodeorambler) who has since deleted their twitter and started selling PEPE. There really isn't much known about him/her besides an affiliation with Milad Maker NFTs.

His etherscan is interesting if you trace it's orgin, thousands and thousands of ETH washed through hundreds of wallets dating back to 2017.

It is a shitcoin. I would say that anyone who invested in PEPE before it blew up is greedy. There are people who invested some spare change in it and did good.

Be happy for people who made money off sh*tcoins. We all have different styles and strategies,"Im one of those people that follows CT pretty closely, it really is a cesspool (like all aspects of twitter) but you do find good alpha there and some nice gems of insight. Youll see people with 8 figure net worth posting about anime and frog pictures saying ‚Äú4‚Äù ad nauseam engaging with all sorts of people, sharing their disdain of the traditional system with the rest of us. This is how i came across $PEPE several days ago, but opted not to invest because like many of you im not into ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù. Im sure many of you have had a similar experience with PEPE or Queen Elizabeth Inu or SHIB or Mongoosecoin etc.

Seeing these giant green candles i said ‚Äúits okay itll dump‚Äù. It didnt. Sidelined watching its market cap go from 20M to 300M. I know its money i never had therefore money never lost, but sad to watch the ship set sail and then i came across this tweet:

&gt; its ok if you dont wanna touch it because it doesnt suit your timeframe preference or style but realize ""its gonna go to zero eventually"" talk is exactly what tardfi ppl say about crypto, ppl getting rich on not-your-bags is not a threat to your profitability or your self worth.

Im guilty of this too and in the future will try to be more constructive with my opinions. Im sure some of you are thinking ‚Äúwhat a shit take think of the people who lost it all‚Äù and you‚Äôre right, but we know the risks of dumping everything we own into a frog coin.

"PEPE Security analysis using GPT4 - Unlimited token minting, user blacklisting, DDoS risk","I used GPT4 to analyze the PEPE token contract.

Here is a security analysis of the given PepeToken contract:  


**Function visibility and access control:**  


The contract is properly making use of the onlyOwner modifier for functions that need owner access control.
Additionally, the Ownable contract is imported, which manages the ownership of the contract.


**Reentrancy risk:**  


The token contract does not seem to have any reentrancy risk, as it does not call external contracts in a way that allows reentrancy.
Safe arithmetic operations:

The contract is using Solidity version 0.8, which has built-in overflow and underflow checks. This reduces the likelihood of arithmetic errors.  


**DOS (Denial of Service):**  


While the contract uses the _beforeTokenTransfer() hook as necessary, it may allow a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker could create a large number of addresses and add them to the blacklist, which would slow down transactions and potentially prevent legitimate users from using the contract.

To minimize this risk, consider limiting the number of addresses that can be added to the blacklist and/or implementing a mechanism for removing addresses from the blacklist.  


**ERC20 standard compliance:** 


The contract seems to comply with the ERC20 standard, implementing the necessary functions, events, and using the OpenZeppelin library in general, which is well-reviewed and secure.  


**Supply control:**  


The contract allows the owner to mint tokens, but does not include a mechanism for pausing or stopping token minting, which may pose a risk of excessive token supply.  


**Use of blacklist:**  


The contract includes a blacklist feature, which restricts certain addresses from sending or receiving tokens.

This could be seen as a centralized mechanism, which may not align with the principles of decentralization. Consider explaining the reasoning behind this feature, and make sure it is used transparently and responsibly.  


**Custom rules and token transfer limits:**  


The contract includes the setRule function to modify transfer limits and enforce custom rules. This feature can be used by the contract owner to manage the maximum and minimum token holdings for addresses.
While this allows for flexibility and control, it can be seen as a centralization point for the owner. Make sure to properly document the use cases and inform users about this feature to avoid any misunderstandings.

"PEPE Meme Coin Skyrockets 39,000%: Binance Listing Next? Or Just a Rug Pull Waiting to Happen?"," 

Hold on to your memes, folks! PEPE meme coin has just hit a jaw-dropping all-time high of $0.000000816, marking a staggering 38,900% increase since its launch on April 14th. This meteoric rise has propelled PEPE into the top 125 coins by market cap.

But let's take a step back and ask ourselves: why do people keep buying potential rug pulls like PEPE? The liquidity of this coin is 65 times less than its market cap, and a huge portion of the coin is held by just a few wallets. Yet, people still freaking buy it!.

What's more, PEPE's 24-hour trading volume has ranked it as the 17th most traded cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. With a market cap of over $326 million in less than two weeks, PEPE is quickly closing in on fellow meme coin Floki (FLOKI). üí®

A recent Binance buyers guide has fueled speculation that the major exchange could list PEPE soon. Remember when Floki Inu's price spiked by 50% after being listed on Binance? Imagine the possibilities for PEPE! Or is it just another rug pull waiting to happen? 

Of course, investing in meme coins comes with its risks, as their prices are tied to online buzz and can be vulnerable to manipulation. üå™Ô∏è But for now, PEPE has captured the internet's imagination and is setting its sights on the top 100. 

So, will PEPE join the ranks of meme tokens that remain permanently etched in the crypto world's consciousness? Or will it end up being another cautionary tale of a rug pull ? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: this little green frog has come a long way since its creation by Matt Furie in 2005. üê∏

Stay tuned, and let's see where this meme-tastic journey takes us next!  And remember, always do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency.

As you can see there are several PEPE icons in the Coinbase wallet and they come up with different swap exchange rates. I should have confirmed the rate but I didn't like a dumbass.

How can I validate the address of the correct PEPE I want to swap to on my Coinbase wallet and where can I find this address?

To Rugpull or not to Rugpull.,"First thing is there's too many shitcoins. Looking to select one that won't be a scam is a needle in a haystack. Even the scammiest of scam coins has a decent enough white paper. The only thing I can think of is that the potential for profit is exceedingly higher on a valid coin than that of a rugpull coin. Sure, you may make a decent amount on the coin you wish to release but you'd have a lot of people hating you as well as potential law suits that could make it worse. On the other side, from what we see from new meme coins like PEPE, the potential to be part of something amazing as well as profitable should be well worth the risk to do it right. So, make a small sum, or make a legacy and actually contribute to this wonderful world of Crypto. 

Maybe require an extensive KYC on the creator and team before a coin could be created?

Have a limit of the amount of cryptos to be released per month? I hope that'd make it more competitive and cause more hurdles hopefully which could prevent scams.

Have someone with extensive knowledge or a board of such people (like Vitalik) review before allowing the coin to continue?

I want to make this a safer place, we can't get there if there's no trust. You fellow redditor's likely know more than me, I'm pretty green. Let's help make this technology better.

"Rebutting the Argument, Moons will Never be in the top 100.","I'm posting this as a rebuttal to a popular post from four days ago, [""Why Moons will never be Top100""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12zz03g/why_moons_will_never_be_top100/). In that post Op made five arguments for why Moons would never be in the top 100, although some arguments have merit most others are bad faith arguments with no merit or validity.

# Quick Reminder on Moons

Op reminds everyone that Reddit has a stance Moons don't have value. Op acknowledges this is a legal argument from Reddit. Nothing else to add to this section.

# Not your everyday sh*tcoin

Ops states Moons won't pump because they aren't your everyday sh\*tcoin and doesn't have any marketing.

This argument ignores the fact it's probably one of the best known tokens of this SubReddit. Moon development is completely community driven, members of this community have 163 ETH in Liquidity and 1.435M Moons on SushiSwap liquidity. One of the best things about Dogecoin is the community that wanted to build and promote it. Moons have what many sh\*t coins wish they had, a community that wants to see it develop.

**So no it's not your average sh\*tcoin where people play the greater fool hoping to pump and not be burned. It's actually being developed in a grassroots way.**

# No one cares

Op states since there are over 6M members of this sub and only 200k Moon holders  (3%) it's proof that no one cares about Moons. Again this is another bad faith argument, a subscriber just means an account that subscribed to a community, it doesn't take into consideration account activity on Reddit. Many of those accounts could be banned bots or old accounts that haven't signed into Reddit for years.

200K Moon Holders is a ton of people. Sh\*tcoins like Pepe dream of ever reaching 10K holders.

A better statistic would be sub activity which is currently \~5,000 active members on at a time. That means the amount of holders is 40x higher than the active member count, so people who are active on the sub do care.

# Holder repartition is a Red Flag

Op claims having Moon whales means these accounts will dump their Moons and prevent any bull run. He also then creates a hypothetical disaster with liquidity providers based off a thought experiment. Again this is a bad argument, although it is true there are big whales that could dump Moons, there are big whales in every crypto asset that could dump. The largest individual Moon holder, holds just over 1% of the total circulating supply or about 2% if you don't consider Reddits Wallets. That isn't that much for a sh\*tcoin.

# Usecase &gt; Pump

Op claims Moons can't pump because people got them for free.

So lets talk another sh\*tcoin, AiDoge is pumping with a marketcap 9x larger than Moons, and it was given to people for free. Why would you buy this sh\*tcoin when you could have gotten it for free or can get it for free? Yet the price is up nearly 10X since it first started being given out.

So ignoring this flawed argument let's talk about Moons. Moons act as a Proof of Engagement/Reputation. The more moons you have the larger your virtual ~~d\*\*k~~  status symbol. People buy skins for video games simply because it'll make them stand out. Ignoring everything else positive about Moons, (Banner, Staking Rewards, most developed Reddit Community Token) people have and will buy Moons to stand out in this SubReddit.

As the supply that gets airdropped every snapshot continues to decrease it will become harder and harder to earn moons, and large Moon holders will stand out even more, further incentivizing users to buy Moons to stand out.

........................

Op is right though, Moons might not ever reach top 100. But his logic and reasonings were mostly rubbish.",47,149,2023-05-01 14:04:57,,CryptoCurrency,PRO-ARGUMENTS

Embracing the Degeneracy of Crypto,"Hey all,

I was just thinking about that recent PEPE post, and it got me thinking:

So,  I know the term ""degen"" has a negative connotation, but hear me out.  Embracing our inner degeneracy might just be the key to success in the  wild world of crypto.

Think about  it. Who are the ones making the biggest gains in the shortest amount of  time? The ones who are willing to take risks and bet on the underdogs.  The ones who aren't afraid to throw caution to the wind and put all  their eggs in one basket.

Sure,  there are plenty of scams and rug pulls out there, but that's where  doing your own research and following the right people comes in. And  sometimes, even the ""safe"" investments can turn out to be duds.

So  I guess this sub really makes us embrace our degeneracy,. Let's take  those moonshots, hop on those meme coins, and ride the waves of the  market with reckless abandon.

Of  course, always remember to never invest more than you can afford to  lose, and never follow blindly. But with a little bit of degeneracy and a  lot of careful planning, who knows where the crypto world could take  us?

Stay safe, stay informed, and happy investing!",4,26,2023-05-01 18:21:16,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

my only shot now is to try to short one of these shitcoins at the top, and since I'm seeing the excitement for them starting to build on the sub, we might be pretty close to the top.

Yet there's really very little information on crypto's technology and adoption. Rather, the media and to some extent we as well focus on:

* Meme coins. PEPE is the new hype. Its a a useless frog coin.
* Celebrities. What did Elon say today? Or perhaps Craig Wright? Did Charles Hoskinson write a Twitter post? The list goes on.
* Dumb stories. The headlines of news articles get weirder and weirder. Everytime someone does something silly in this space it gets covered.
* Scams and hacks. There's so many scams and hacks, and each event gets loads of coverage.

I used to think it was funny at the start. Never a dull day in crypto. But the longer I am here and the more I learn about the blockchain technology, the more I hate that all the attention goes to the shitty side of crypto rather than how amazing crypto truly is.

"The truth about meme coins - by the time you hear about one, it's way too late to make money on it. The only people who make money are founders and crypto insiders. Ordinary people are there to be exit liquidity and that's it.","I see meme coins are starting to make a comeback and I want to warn all you investors out there before you get sucked into the fantasy of becoming a millionaire from $100 of meme coins.

The fact about crypto in general is that 99% of the time the vast majority of money made from a token is made by the founders and other crypto insiders... I'm talking about the big returns you hear about like $100 turning into a million. Obviously us plebians can make returns by buying ETH and seeing it double over the course of years, but I know that the fantasy of taking a $100 and turning it into seven figures is incredibly alluring.

What happens is that the founders and crypto insiders invest in the tokens before they start hyping them. The hyping process is there to create exit liquidity for the founders and insiders. The plebians are there to take the inevitable loss since meme coins have no real utility or value so they always crash sooner or later.

Of course there have been the odd plebe here or there whose hit it big with meme coins but they are far and few between. Please please please don't fall for meme coins... Maybe we can even put them out of existence through just ignoring them.

ETA: what prompted me to write this post is seeing all the posts trying to promote PEPE...like the article about someone turning $27 into a million. I can tell you for certain now that buying PEPE at this point will not give you this type of return and is highly likely to leave you with a loss. Also a small number of connected wallets hold a significant portion of the coins...lastly don't forget that meme coins are very vulnerable to rug pulls and scams. Security and integrity are not important to the people behind these coins.",512,303,2023-05-01 20:59:54,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Pepe Quick Analysis," 

The term pepe has been trending on Twitter and Stocktwits a lot over the past week or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lyvk8g7qyexa1.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2c547c6a0f7f9478ef405b9e862d2c7f635ced2

The chatter has been centered around the idea that PEPE could rival other meme coins such as Doge and Shib, which of course started off as a joke but Doge and Shib and both now in the top 15 crypto currencies and have market caps of $10B and $6B respectively. 

Just like doge and shib Pepe is starting out as a purley meme coin but could shift into utility just like doge and shib. The coin has a max supply of 420 trillion coins (ha)

The most compelling bull case i've heard for PEPE is The large exchanges are not listing Pepe yet. If Pepe gets listed on Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and other large exchanges we could see a serious jump in price from PEPE. 

You can still buy this coin in the US early if you would like you can use the link in the description to buy from MEXC.com. I tested this site out and can confirm it works, if you have any issues they have a pretty solid live chat.  

Its still very early days for PEPE as the Market cap is $130M  Which is only a tenth of a percent (0.1%) of the size of Doge coin which sits at over $10B. The total number of addresses holding PEPE has increased every day the coin has existed as well which I found pretty interesting. 

Obviously do your own research and please don't take my words as a screaming buy recommendation. Any dollar you put into PEPE you should be willing to completely lose as this coin is pure speculation at this point.

What do you think about PEPE, is it going to be a crypto fad or could this coin one day rival Doge and Shib. Let me know in the comments!

Pepe set to make MAJOR move higher once we get a break of resistance around $0.0000014,"**PEPE Technical Analysis** 

I've talked about my general bull thesis on PEPE. In prior videos but today I just wanted to focus Purely on technicals and short term trading.

Clearly we have a pretty strong resistance level around 0.0000014. Three sperate days PEPE has rejected this level (below is daily chart).  


*Processing img 2tf7vsaqfjxa1...*

Now let's break it down to the 4 hour level. That 0.0000014 resistance level halted advances on three four hour candles.

*Processing img zgkfb9rffjxa1...*

We are seeing some support which is where PEPE bottomed out yesterday. 

We look to be forming an ascending triangle with that 14 level being firm resistance. As you can see the trend line which has been in effect since Saturday is quite strong and could continue to push shares higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img dez0zv60gjxa1...*

Obviously I only have two weeks of chart data to work with here but one thing that every chartist would agree with is that the $0.0000014 resistance level is pretty significant and if we get a break of that level we are likely to see more upside.

Do not let yourself be tempted by shitcoins,"Hello fellow crypto degenerates.

I wanted to share my perspective after what has happened (and what is still happening) with the latest shitcoin's huge pump. Yes I am talking about PEPE.

I know that each time something like this happens, where you see a random guy turning a bunch of dollars into life-changing money, It can be very tempting to fall for It and trying to find the next big coin. 

However be advised that we (as human beings) always tend to give a lot of importance and relevance to good and positive events, while we tend to undervaluate the bad ones. This is a very dangerous bias that is hardwired into our brains. Do not forget that for every guy that is able to turn a bunch of dollars into millions, there is a thousand of them ""losing the bet"" and some money (sometimes even huge amounts).

I guess this is an advice especially for people that are new to crypto: pick a project that you believe in and invest into that. DCA, rince and repeat. Enjoy the ride.",93,260,2023-05-02 12:26:16,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

For the people blaming this sub for missing out on PEPE..,"I don't know if these are spam accounts or if they're actually r/CC daily users that are complaining but I've seen a consistent stream of posts and comments about how they missed out on pepe because they listened to others in this sub. I don't think that the majority of people here want anyone to miss out on profits, but also the majority of people here have seen people burned over and over by these pump and dump shitcoins. Personally, I know a guy that got in ""early"" on the SHIB hype and made about 40k off some of the people that got in later. Naturally he was pretty amped up about that and I was happy for him. Well, long story short he took that 40k and put it in the next ""big thing."" expecting to get rich. That next ""big thing"" is called JACY, it's down 97.66% from the ATH, it's got less than 2k in daily volume, and his bag is currently worth less than $500. Now, of course, everyone reading this that feels that they're smarter than him and that they wouldn't continue to gamble their profits on the next ""big thing"", I say to you good luck. Greed is a cruel mistress, we're only human and humans are full of mistakes. Stop blaming this sub for your decisions.

Crypto disappoints me greatly with meme coins,"Take this post with a heaping bag of salt, maybe a salt mine even.

I just don't get why people are investing in shib, doge, elon, floki, shiti, crapi or any of the other stupid coin names they can come up with. I think it makes the space look immature and basically slows adoption by directing focus onto such nonsense. Imagine in traditional finance a company opens and says they have no plan but a logo, and everyone buys into it because ""memes"". It really is just a sad thing to see when people take actual money and put it into something like this when they could definitely be strengthening a project that actually is accomplishing something. But hey I know most are here for profit and will just throw money into the abyss hoping it comes back 100x or something magically. That's just gambling though and not investing.

If you happened to invest in PEPE and made a big profit, well congrats you just helped delegitimize crypto moreso. And I really know deep in my heart a rug is coming, either that or they just suck the life out of it as more liquidity replaces the old suckers. If you want to contribute to something like this, you are the reason we are laughed at as a community. They don't see the good projects in the mainstream, only the jokes. And this is one of the biggest jokes yet, same as any meme coin before it. If you want to actively work against the community as a whole, what better way than to support this crap. Downvote me all you want I'm just sick of these shitty meme coins dominating the news when we should be focusing on more important matters, like the fucking recession coming. But hey let's just get distracted by a fucking frog right?

How to buy a meme coin relatively early.,"Seeing some memes are flying right now (meme season?). I thought I would share a manual how to buy these relatively early. 

1. Send fiat to your main CEX e.g. Binance, Coinbase. Then buy $20 of XLM. 

2. Open an account on gate.io or MEXC. Use a VPN if need be. They will verify you only with you email and phone number. These are non KYC exchanges. 

3. After opening. Generate an XLM address. There are two parts, the main address and memo I.d. Copy and paste these into a word document. 

4. Go back to your CEX (Coinbase for example). Send only 1 dollar's worth of XLM as a test transaction by copy and pasting the address and memo Id, save the address and send it. Then open your other exchange (MEXC). See if it has arrived (usually takes 10 minutes max).

5. Send the other 19 bucks doing the same process. You have now successfully moved money on chain. 

6. In Mexc, trade all your XLM to USDT first. Now you are ready to buy your meme coin by doing a USDT/BALLS (for example) trade. 

Why these exchanges? No KYC, they usually get these coins right after Uniswap. Can use Uniswap, but it is annoying with gas fees as they are. 

Why XLM? Stellar Lumens are usually the fastest and cheapest on chain. But could also do any other coin if you like. 

Tip: can set a stop loss too if you only want to lose half your money if it is a flop/scam. Also if it doubles (like Wojak and Pepe did for me recently). Take out your original 20 bucks and let it ride. Or even 50% up is a good idea too. 

I also give it a few days as well. Sometimes they need catching on. If they are trending on Coingecko and Twitter, it might still have more to run if it's a low MC. But this is all up to you.",5,93,2023-05-02 20:42:27,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL

This is just sad,"A few days ago I made a post about a swap I saw on Uniswap. Someone had swapped $0.04 Eth for Pepe, with the gas fee almost $10. I asked the question ""what would drive someone to make such an insanely unprofitable trade? 

The most common answer was that many people simply do not understand the fee structure. I didn't agree at the time, mainly due to stalking the address and seeming *shitloads of shitcoins* from various Defi protocols. But, after thinking about it for awhile, I'm inclined to believe that yes, in desperation to get their hands on the next Shiba Inu, many people are making incredibly stupid trades to get rich.

Then I saw this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j4qe60angjxa1.jpg?width=1509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3af44502d9554e7b3edd42558ab4d6d80a58cceb

$0.04 was damn near the lowest amount swapped I'd ever seen, but I have seen some 2-centers. But *less than a penny?* Of course, lets look at that gas fee. PEPE volume has been insane lately, so I just knew I was gonna see some pain.

&amp;#x200B;

That's right folks. Someone payed almost THIRTY DOLLARS in fees to net themselves 0.03 PEPE. I have no words.

Now lets have a look at this poor soul's transaction history:

Two transactions total. Transfer from Coinbase, swap to PEPE. What we have here is a CEFI baby that heard about PEPE, and took their first steps into DEFI. Maybe they went on to make a post about how insane the fees are on Uniswap, maybe they thought this was some kind of error. Who knows.

At this point, it's just sad. This is like watching someone shoot up meth. Friends, please don't DEFI and drive. No shitcoin is worth it.",357,401,2023-05-03 03:51:00,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Why the next bullrun will be different to previous ones.,"Wether you are bear or bull currently it‚Äôs fair to assume that we are on our way towards another bullrun, obviously the timing of it can and will be debated infinitely on here, but we have seen a huge bear move in the crypto markets this past 12+ months and an upward swing is to be expected.

Here‚Äôs what I think will be significantly different about the next bull run:

Alts: 
Time has moved on in the crypto world, people‚Äôs awareness of what is and what isn‚Äôt worthy of spending their hard earned cash on has evolved, Alts on the whole are dogshit, they are a moonshot and for every PEPE there are hundreds of other worthless meme coins that disappear into obscurity, these last years we have seen huge amounts of people new to the space entering via memecoins and I think the heightened publicity on just how bad these coins are will see less emphasis on this sector next bullrun, hopefully many of the worst ones will simply disappear, the entire crypto space needs to slim down in my opinion.

Bluechips: 
Following on from the above comment I think we will see much more money flow into the top coins this time with BTC and ETH being the main targets for people looking to invest in the long run, globally people‚Äôs awareness of the word ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù has become synonymous with cryptocurrency and it is the first name people say when you mention crypto in my experience, so it‚Äôs natural new money will gravitate towards it, it‚Äôs also the ‚ÄúGold standard‚Äù of the industry. 

Secondary ‚Äúdecent networks‚Äù such as, and it pains me to say some of these networks but they are current favourites, Solana/Matic/Cardano/XRP etc will also see higher flows as people are priced out of the top coins as price moves higher. 

The NFT world had a big impact on bringing in revenue and raising awareness to the crypto space this last 18months but again that has largely been shown to be fugazi with 99% of projects either straight rugs or slow rugs, granted the 1% that have provided value have done so in a cool manner but the rest of the space is just trying to copy the vision of projects like BAYC/Degods etc and for anyone paying attention to that space it‚Äôs clear to see the cycle there mimics meme shitcoins: create hype, promise roadmap, create mint fomo, mint, sell into exit liquidity for those that got in early. 
I think the NFT space continues to weaken as it has exhausted the supply of willing idiots and kids with daddy‚Äôs credit cards.

The next bullrun will face plenty of headwind with basically the US government trying their hardest to suppress and destroy the groundswell of optimism that it could be a legitimate alternative to the failing global financial system. 

As always it will be down to the Hodlers to keep chipping away with accumulation of the coins that will ultimately prevail and hopefully some new, big players will emerge and not make the same mistakes as the likes of FTX and Do Kwon, but we al know greed will be the only winner and a fool and his money will always be easily parted.

TLDR: next bullrun driven heavily by the Bluechips, Alts underperform, NFT space dwindles and money from there flows to bluechips.",0,87,2023-05-03 08:06:13,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

A short list of crypto launch tiers and how to know whats what,"Hey, so today SUI Mainnet has launched and has been highly anticipated. As to this moment of posting, the price is still increasing, just like we witnessed with ARB weeks ago, right after it launched. 

I wanted to share some tipps and a small tier list, for beginners, on how to spot which launch might be shortterm profitable.

**Tier 1**
(recent examples are SUI, ARB &amp; OP):

These coins are highly anticipated and are probably making shortterm gains. They are beeing advertised by (crypto)newssites, beeing advertised by multiple Tier 1 CEX's(f.e. Binance) and when beeing launched are probably launched on multiple CEX's at once. Almost all of them have Venture Capitalists as early bird investors. These Cryptos(mostly Coins), are either innovating something new or are advancing. Beware the gains can be only shortterm before they dump a bit and then stabilize. 

**Tier 2**
(for example CGPT/GPT, the native token to a DEX on a new blockchain, a Chiliz clubtoken, NFT-Tokens etc): 

These coins/tokens have a base of users for their public ICO and afterwards protocoll/blockchain, sometimes an amount of early VCs have invested in them and they have some sort of relevance which is mostly shortlived. They are a lot of times beeing launched on a single CEX or a DEX but after releasing are slowly beeing adopted by other platforms. 

These coins and tokens are risky because they mostly have a shortlived pump and afterwards a massive selloff before stagnating or even worse slowly declining in value over time. Day traders can make bigger amounts of gains but can loose even more aswell.

**Tier 3**
(mostly tokens, like Pepe &amp; Bonk)

These tokens just suddenly arise and are very hard to track. There's a one in a million chance of either getting a token which makes a profit or finding something without a value. If you do find one and are early, you might become a millionaire without having to invest more then a hundred dollars. These tokens who do succeed, are in most cases not long lived either. They almost always launch on their own ico without prior funding and/or on the main DEX of their native blockchain with a soft launch. You never know which one is a scam or not. If you hear about it on a (crypto)newssite, its probably to late to invest in it. If you hear about it from your father and you haven't invested in it it is definitely to late. 

Going through Tier 3 (tokens) is like going through a junkyard trying to find something with worth in it.

**Tier 0**
(for example Cryptozoo, Jugs, Squid etc)

These Cryptos are most likely scams. They either are because they are blatantly advertised by influencers which are famous for not caring about their fans, beeing randomly advertised by crypto shills (*cough* Bitboy *cough*) or their whitepaper indirectly/directly say they are scams(Squid, Rugpull Token).

These cryptocurrencies are shitcoins and are only there to benefit its creator. If you feel like Jason Statham in Crank and need the adrenaline rush you can try to flip these tokens in the first minutes (or hours if extremely lucky) before they are beeing rugpulled.

These tokens will never be relevant. Do not touch. They are the equivalent of touching radioactive waist. Even interacting with their page could kill you and your wallet(aka draining it). Do not interact with them.

I really hope I was a little bit informative for the newer users who are unsure about launches and if to invest in them.

Oh and yes of course Moons are **S Tier** because they are outmatching every other crypto by beeing distributed to redditors.",5,16,2023-05-03 17:36:35,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

"Just remember, when you are excited enough to make screen-shots of you profits, that‚Äòs when you should sell.","It seems to be that time again of a Crypto rally where many random shitcoins just randomly take off. This kind of a ‚Äúmeme coin rally‚Äú, as many already call it, is usually also a top indicator for the preceding move up in all of Crypto. The order is always the same: First Bitcoin pumps, then ETH pumps, then alts pump and at last random shitcoins.

Even with that in mind many seem to FOMO into the latest shitcoins as PEPE, AIDOGE or what not. While quite a few right now are also in profits as the bought a bit earlier and there was enough money to pump something like PEPE even into the top 100 cryptos.


But through all of that FOMO and euphoria some are experiencing right now, they seem to forget what the fate from all the previous meme coin rallys as right now were, they always end in a rug-pull or Bitcoin starts moving down a bit more and they suddenly drop -80% in one day.

Those that are actually in profits right now may be very happy, but remember. The golden rule is that, as soon as you are so happy that you taking screenshots of you profits to send it to a friend, this is exactly the time where you should also be taking those profits and not miss-out.

I can even speak from experience, as during 2021 I ran a shitcoin from a $10 investment all the way up to $200, but did not take profits. Until this day it is still by far my biggest missed opportunity, don‚Äòt be like me.",239,155,2023-05-03 20:07:03,,CryptoCurrency,REMINDER

Everyone who has ever bought Bitcoin or Ethereum was once someone else's Exit Liquidity. There's nothing wrong with being exit liquidity. It's being the exit liquidity of a pumping sh*t coin or questionable ALT that is the problem.,"We always make jokes about being Exit Liquidity. But there's nothing wrong with being exit liquidity, assuming you're investing in Crypto Blue Chips.

It's when you start gambling on ""which sh\*t coin is the next Pepe"", or to a lesser extent going big on up and coming alts that you start running into problems. These pumping shitcoins either rug fast enough to make creators money or last long enough that early buyers get to make someone else their exit liquidity. Although a few Alts will be profitable long term - most alts in the top 100 will not be in the top 100 in one year.

Be happy you have a chance to invest in Crypto blue chips. BTC and ETH have a long history of exit liquidity making others their exit liquidity.

"Pepe broke to new highs, MAJOR Binance listing news!","PEPE has broken resistance of $0.00000014 and is moving higher quickly. This $0.00000014 level is where PEPE had topped out on April 18th, May 1st and May 2nd. I believe a break of this resistance level could cause PEPE to have a serious run higher. 

On pace for uptick in volume for today, when an increase in volume is combined with a breakout the breakout is more significant. Technicals look great for PEPE!

Fundamentally Pepe could really see a jump in price once large exchanges such as Binance and coinbase list.   
Interestingly we got some recent news from Binance in regard to Pepe being listed. Bianace‚Äôs CEO said in an AMA (ask me anything forum) a couple days ago ‚Äú everything that Binance does is dictated by the interest of its users. He outlined that if PEPE continues to trend and sees increased demand, the exchange could list it. He also explained that he‚Äôs not personally involved in the listing process.‚Äù I'm sure he didn't want to come straight out and say PEPE will be listed because the market would jump instantly if he did but if you read the tea leaves here he for sure is hinting that Pepe could be listed on the popular exchange. 

Given Pepe is fifth in volume on exchanges like Uniswap I think it's a foregone conclusion Pepe will be listed on Bianace its just a matter of when. Once Binance jumps on the Pepe train other big exchanges such as coinbase should follow.

Don't buy shitcoins you are neither a whale or an insider so you will not make money.

Stop being exit liquidity for other people.

We have all been exit liquidity before but as long as it's not for shit coins it's okay.

First of all stop telling people what to do with their money. Are any of you a cpa, or are registered with the sec to be giving financial advice?

You sound like the government. ""Were just trying to protect you from scams""

People are going to buy shitcoins, heroin, meth, candy, cigarettes, etc. Who are you to tell me or anyone not to?

Let people do what they want with their money and worry about your money. Don't want to be exit liquidity? Then don't buy but keep it to yourself. Some people get rich if they are early enough. If some one makes a grand off pepe or baby wsb maybe that's life changing money to them.

If they lose it so be it. Not like they lost there life.

Being a conspiracy theorist wont make you rich,"We have a couple of meme coins pumping right now and there are some whales buying. This has lead people in this sub to speculate that these whales have insider knowledge. A lot of people in crypto believe in whale conspiracy theories. E.g. driving down prices to buy cheaper or setting things up for a rug pull.

While the financial market has always had whales doing bad things, it doesn't help if you think whales always get it right. Or if you think every pump will end in a forever dump.

Whales get things wrong a lot. If you are old in crypto (pre 2016) you will know of people who were whales in the old days and some who are whales today. The market was small then and we knew who many of the big holders were. These people made mistakes and we saw them clearly. They got rich from BTC and then they would invest in projects that tanked. Some whales have lost a lot from trading. Whales can be just as dumb as many noobs.

Whales might be on average more knowledgeable than the noobs but they do make huge mistakes too.

Secondly if you think every pump is bound to lead to loss or is manipulation then you would have never made huge gains from BTC &amp; ETH. You were probably the sort of person that never heard about BTC in the early days or who never took it seriously. Your lack of knowledge is not the fault of whales.

One of the most frustrating things about this sub is how there are so many terrible investors and traders here who think it is not possible to make big money in crypto because they are bad at it. They think that since they are bad then anyone making money must be doing some manipulation or insider trading. Just because you are bad at picking coins at the right time doesn't mean there are not clever people who can do it. You are the type of person who bought tops while blaming whales of buying at the bottom and no one stopped you buying bottoms too.

Pepe is a useless project but if a whale times it right it doesn't always mean they are doing manipulation. They might be smart and make a lot or stupid and lose a lot. You too could make smart or dumb moves.",19,90,2023-05-04 17:30:25,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

"Why $Pepe Crypto has EXPLODED 1,200% In Price in ONLY A Week!?!?",,4,1,2023-05-05 21:35:33,,Pepecryptocurrency,
Just lost a small chunk of ETH trying to ape into PEPE,"Listen up, fellow crypto enthusiasts! If you're thinking about accessing an old hot wallet, you might want to proceed with caution. Why? Well, let me tell you a little story.

So, today I got the sudden urge to ape into PEPE. I mean, who wouldn't want to throw some small change at a coin named after a cartoon frog, right? Anyway, I decided to check out my old phone, where I had installed Metamask and an old unused hot wallet. I didn't think there was anything valuable in there, so I figured it was safe to use.

I copied the wallet address to my new phone, where I keep most of my holdings in a CEX, and transferred a small chunk of ETH to that address. I waited patiently for a few minutes, knowing that the network is currently congested. But after five minutes, then ten, then thirty, I still hadn't received my ETH.

Finally, I got a notification telling me that a transfer transaction had occurred 20 minutes ago, along with another transaction telling me that I had sent ETH to another wallet at almost the same time. It suddenly hit me - my freaking wallet had been compromised!

Now, I'm not exactly a whale in the crypto world, but losing 0.03 ETH isn't the end of the world for me. But it still hurts knowing that I basically threw money at a hacker. I had already resigned myself to losing every little dime of it anyway, since I was going to use it to ape into PEPE - a coin that pumped 1000x for no apparent reason a few months ago. But it would have been more thrilling to lose my money to a legitimate cause, you know?

Anyway, the moral of the story is: don't store anything for too long in your hot wallet, and change it up frequently. And if you do decide to ape into PEPE, make sure you do it with caution. Who knows, maybe you'll end up with a frog in your pocket instead of a hole in your wallet!

"Don't waste time thinking about wasted opportunities in crypto. Instead analize them and decide if you were just unlucky (it happen) or if you made actual mistake. If the former you have nothing to regret, if latter then learn your lesson and be better next time.","Everyone have some regrets in crypto space. It is normal. All of us have stories about ""If only I bought BTC earlier/ didn't ever touch that rugged coin at all / if I would buy this memecoin/ or sell something earlier or later"". But it already happened, either you made mistake or it was just matter of luck. If you didn't DYOR, get rugged or scammed you should admit mistakes were made, learn your lesson and next time not do the same. Improvement is most important step in your crypto journey.

Famous saying is: ""If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on you"". You in this quote can mean everything crypto related. Doing something wrong is not thing to be ashamed of, but if you do the same thing over and over you can't balme anyone else than yourself. Also never act like luck were against you. If you need to depend on luck you are a gambler and your decision probably wasn't smart at all.

I could buy pepe when it had just $600k marketcap. If I would throw just $20 maybe $50 I would have tens of thousands dollars now. I am bit sad I didn't? Of course, that would be a lot of money. But did I regret it? No. When I heard about this memecoin it didn't stand out, it was another shitcoin  that was more likely to rug than make me rich. I made calculated decision to not waste money. In 99% of situations it would be smart. But it pumped like crazy. I could regret it now and try to FOMO  into pepe or search for another memecoin that can possibly pump like that. But I know it was only matter of luck and just like back then now I still have no idea why people like it so much. So  I have no regrets. I made no mistakes, it was just luck. If that coin would die I wouldn't even know about that and have no second thoughts. Sometimes you need to be ""a man"" and admit  something is nothing to regret and you can't learn anything on your decision.

If on the other hand I would find some project I truly believe in and which according to my DYOR is great then yes I probably would regret it and should learn on my mistake. Such project for me can be moons. I truly believe in them and according to my best knowledge they have a lot of potential. If they will pump I know it won't be just stupid luck, but all effort Reddit and cc community put in them. Other coins like that are BTC or ETH. Maybe they won't pump as much as some memecoin, but unlike  memecoins they aren't popular just cause of hype and some luck. They have quality all of us should consider. If random memecoin pump nothing to regret, it was matter of luck. If top project pump then blame not luck but your lack of DYOR and not enough knowledge.",21,41,2023-05-05 13:26:47,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

We might be on either the verge of a bull run or we‚Äôve hit the top for now,"I‚Äôm 2021, I was just getting into crypto and was telling some friends about it and to look into it. A cpl bought into the big cap coins but 3 of them wrote it all of as a scam.

That just changed two days ago. One of the people that wrote it off and hasn‚Äôt entertained any discussion since texted me asking for help buying Pepe. I told him I can‚Äôt help him because I‚Äôll be blamed if the token crashed. He was adamant that he wouldn‚Äôt so I said the most I‚Äôll do is send him wallet apps and my coinbase referral and a YouTube video explaining uniswap

Well, I‚Äôm sad to report that they got it all sorted out and have gone all in on Pepe this morning. He won‚Äôt tell me how much exactly but said it was more than $5K. I told him he‚Äôs crazy for a first time but I guess we‚Äôll see.

This anecdotal story reminds me of when people say ‚Äúwhen your grandma calls you and asks about crypto‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Disclaimer: I bought pepe day 3 and pulled out my initial ethereum gamble 2 days ago. I am now riding house money, I didn‚Äôt mention pepe to a single friend or person I know.",1,20,2023-05-05 18:23:01,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL
You think the current memecoin frenzy is dumb now? I have a dumb prediction for when the next bull run comes and crazier amounts of dumb money inevitably flow in.,"Cat coins will replace dog coins as the next hyped memecoins. Yep, you heard it here first. It‚Äôs time for cats to have their moment in the crypto sun.

Look, you can scream ‚Äúscam‚Äù and ‚Äúrugpull‚Äù all you want, but anyone who has been around for multiple bull markets will tell you that the dumbest projects pump like crazy during a bull market‚Äôs euphoria phase. The pressure of intense FOMO makes people throw money at anything in hopes of getting rich overnight at the crypto casino.

Investors are going to be looking for the next memecoin sensation during the next bull run - this is a a fact. Will DOGE and SHIB still reign as the meme kings? Will they be overtaken by FLOKI and PEPE? Or will an entirely new animal reign supreme? Enter the cat.

There currently aren‚Äôt many cat themed projects. The notable ones right now are Pawthereum (PAWTH), Cat Token (CAT), and Catgirl (CATGIRL). But given the spontaneous nature of crypto, there‚Äôs a good chance the next memecoin king doesn‚Äôt even exist right now! Can you imagine this irrational market dominated by a cat vs. dog meme battle being fought among desperate investors with dollar signs in their eyes? I sure can!

While it‚Äôs uncertain what will define the next bull market, one thing is for certain: dumb money will always flow into crypto. Try not to hate on new investors too much, as new investors help grow the community. After all, today‚Äôs memecoin investors are tomorrow‚Äôs BTC and ETH investors.

TL;DR - I‚Äôm making a dumb prediction for a dumb market.",73,151,2023-05-05 18:26:43,,CryptoCurrency,COMEDY

Are these MEME coins actually a good thing for crypto?,"I mean obviously they are terrible and are nothing more than a tragedy waiting to happen for a lot of people but hear me out.

The world is full of people in dead end jobs, bounded by the shackles or capitalism and financial restrictions. Most people, in fact nearly all people will struggle financially for a good portion of their lives and so there has to be a ray of hope somewhere along the line.

People play the lottery, gamble, hunt for deals and dream of financial freedom. They have done since the dawn of civilisation‚Ä¶ So my point being, what‚Äôs the difference? 

The exposure of a few people becoming millionaires through crypto far outweighs the unfortunate many who sadly lose money. Of course it‚Äôs all a game of chance and timing but that‚Äôs effectively the only shot any of us have at actually getting to retire at a decent age.

I didn‚Äôt do anything with PEPE I‚Äôm far too cautious, if the wind is blowing I‚Äôm holding onto my wallet! But there are people out there right now who‚Äôve just sold their measly investment for a fortune and can phone work tomorrow to call it quits. 

I‚Äôm not advertising these coins, or condoning them, I don‚Äôt have the right to do either. But I am at least partly convinced that this has a positive impact on the number of people joining crypto hoping to break free from it all. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this mini pump is due to a spike in activity as a direct result of PEPE. 

If crypto is in the news it‚Äôs getting buyers is what I‚Äôm trying to say, for better or for worse‚Ä¶",17,153,2023-05-05 19:33:23,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

TRON and SHIBA INU are top 15 coins. How can we take the crypto market seriously like this?,"According to Coinmarketcap TRON sits at spot 13 and SHIBA INU at spot 15.  
If that's not bad enough, we have DOGE at 8, SOL, which is down more than it is running, at 10!  
Also, Tether, USDC and BNB...

To be honest, at the current stage it seems to me 95% of coins in the market has no real utility or intrinsic value. What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How can people not see the crypto market like a large online betting site when everything gains value from short time speculation and manipulation and when the price isn't really correlated with the quality of the product. It's just all the hype (looking at you PEPE). Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever.

This latest meme season has shown me Ethereum is unusable as a Layer 1 and you cannot change my mind," 

*Opening disclosure: I do not promote you do the same, I have a very balanced portfolio but occasionally I will throw left over money into meme hype coins just for fun.*

This topic is designed to show you how chasing the next meme coin could be an expensive lesson.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**It all started with Meme season 2021.**

Looked at Shiba when it was 2-3 million market cap.

Looked at Safemoon when it was 10-20 million market cap.

I went with Safemoon for stupid money because the process of transferring my bank money to an exchange for BNB and then swapping from BNB to the meme token was very straight forward with maybe $3-4 gas fees tops.

Fast forward 2 years and PEPE and Eth based meme coins are back. Thought it was time I at least got involved; if at the very least to show me why I passed up on Shiba in 2021 (Eth being such a clunky, expensive experience).

Follow my journey - so you won't have to!

**Part 1: A brand new adventure. Transfer a few spare bobs into Eth and find the next 1000x.**

**Part 2: Transfer that 0.11 Eth to UniSwap for a 0.00182 Eth Fee!**

&amp;#x200B;

 **Part 3: Accidentally transfer all Eth in Wrapped Eth, so you cannot buy your Meme as you don't have another $20 Eth lying around as a gas fee. (\*\*You will likely need to transfer Eth to Wrapped Eth in order to buy your low cap meme. This requires Eth, in this case, 0.0043 of it.)** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q7svktefu4ya1.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb98d3a642d489e0c69c47d6b79c811a9e02b9c3

 **Part 4: Having got this far, I knew I would now need to unwrap my Wrapped Eth back to Eth to re-do and have enough Eth to get the meme. But you won't have enough Eth to do this. You will then need to buy More Eth and repeat steps from Step 1 (and more fees).** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Chances are by now, like me, having used quicker and leaner Layer 1's, you have now given up on Ethereum. And I don't blame you. I have given up on Ethereum.

Total Fee cost for the experience $55\~

Total loss $250 ($200 of Wrapped Eth sitting on UniSwap).

Its 2023. Eth does not make decentralised money easier IMO.",322,389,2023-05-06 03:45:05,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Should you short meme-coins? The answer is NO. But don't go long either...,"With the rise of meme coins once again, comes the inevitable opportunity to make and loose a lot of money. Many of these coins are scams, not advised to be invested in...

However, there will always be a not insignificant group of people who think that it is their opportunity to make money quickly. This is usually fueled by an even smaller group, who have managed to make life changing money on these coins.  
What ever your decision is, it is your money at the end of the day, and the risk to reward ratio is pretty clear.

However, the one thing you should NEVER do, is to leverage your position on these shitcoins. 90% of the time you will be screwed over, and the reason is not that obvious.

If you just decide to buy and own the coin, the price can go up or down. You can make money or loose money... but fundamentally, you still own the coins themselves. When you get into leverage, you risk being liquidated, and even more so with shitcoins.  
These coins can easily jump/dip in upwards of 20% within minutes, and then continuing their trend (wether its up or down). 20% is usually more than enough to have any leverage position liquidated. Essentially, you will always loose.

&amp;#x200B;

TL.DR: Don't leverage shitcoins like PEPE. Shitcoins have more significant price spikes, making it easier to be liquidated even if you predict the market trend right.

\- Not saying you should leverage normal coins either, just saying its even easier to loose money leveraging shitcoins.  
\- Also not recommending to invest in shitcoins

Ethereum Gas Fees are too damn high!,"Just went to stake some more ETH onto Lido and noticed that to do so would cost me around $50 in gas fees. It's insane that these prices are happening because of the meme coin fiasco! 

I assume this has to do with PEPE coin but surely this isn't a great indicator for crypto if something like this hype can essentially ruin the process for people doing something entirely different?

Does anyone have any experience of this beforehand and any way to lower it down to the usual $5ish gas fees I've been paying over the last few months.

I want to keep staking while I can and these gas fees completely ruin my DCA. 

Always been a big believer in crypto but seeing something like this happen really makes me apprhensive for the future. In the near term at least.

‚ÄúLaugh While You Mine: Adding Fun and Humor to Your Crypto Mining Sessions.‚Äù,"

1. What's the difference between an alt coin and a meme coin? One is a serious investment that could make you rich, and the other is a joke investment that will probably make you laugh!

2. Why did the alt coin invest in the meme coin? To add some humor to its portfolio!

3. What do you call a group of alt coin investors who are always arguing with meme coin investors? A crypto civil war!

4. Why did the meme coin go to the moon? To escape the alt coin's shadow!

5. What's the best way to invest in alt coins and meme coins? Flip a coin and hope for the best!

6. Why did the alt coin break up with the meme coin? Because it realized that it was the punchline of a joke!

7. What do you call an alt coin that's always trying to be like a meme coin? A wannabe!

8. Why did the meme coin go viral? Because it had the perfect combination of humor and hype!

9. How many alt coins does it take to change a light bulb? None, because they're too busy trying to change the world!

10. What do you call a meme coin that's always making people laugh? A joke that's worth millions!


Once upon a time, Pepe the frog invested all his savings in Pepe Coin. The value rocketed to the moon, but soon began to drop. Pepe didn't give up and continued to create memes and jokes about Pepe Coin. As a result, Pepe Coin regained its value, teaching Pepe an important lesson about investing in cryptocurrency: have fun, but shitcoin will stay üí©coin


Once, Alt and Meme were at odds with each other - Alt was serious, while Meme was all about humor. But they realized that by combining their strengths, they could create something unique and valuable. They teamed up, created a blockchain platform that was both innovative and fun, and attracted a huge following. They continued to collaborate and make jokes and memes together, but bringing joy and innovation to the world of cryptocurrency many people makes money and so much people remain empty wallets

Coin with huge potential Angry Pepe $APEPE for all the ANGRYPEPEs who missed their opportunity,[removed],1,0,2023-05-07 02:25:09,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS
Gas Fees.... OOof,"TL;DR Over the last couple of weeks we have seen ETH gas fees go from \~40-45 Gwei to over 130 Gwei an astronomical increase in such a short time. I feel like I need to say this but I am not against meme tokens but when you account for such a large transaction volume it kinda is the result. One of the biggest causes of this is the meme token PEPE which has led me to wonder about the impact this has to encourage adoption with a higher barrier of entry now existing and the old critique of pricing out people who are only doing $50 to $100 transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

After months of low transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain users have been hit with transaction costs not seen in over a year. This seems to have generated some unique reactions in my opinion. When Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake (PoS) it seems that some people still think this alone would drive down gas prices. I was surprised to see people still stuck on this idea since this was never the plan for Ethereum. When they first made the move and this rumor even started the developers quickly moved to squash it. Developers pointed to the environmental importance of the move given the political movements against crypto due to power consumption coupled with allowing more users to participate in securing the network.¬†¬†

&amp;#x200B;

To address the gas fees issues faced other changes were implemented to try and help out the network. I honestly am not sure if they really fully worked to the state that we have given them credit for because crypto was and has been in a winter. Now that it is starting to wake up and move out of it we have seen gas fees go from 30 Gwei to over 140 Gwei a significant change, to say the least. What has led this charge is another meme coin run with PEPE exploding from next to nothing to having a market cap of almost $1.3 billion, larger than The Graph (GRT), the Sandbox (SAND), and even Curve (CRV)!

&amp;#x200B;

While some people love these episodes and enjoy seeing people end up with windfalls of cash I tend to be much more hesitant about the pros of this. With how much the transaction fees have increased regular Ethereum blockchain users suffer the fallout. People who might have been participating in other ways like DeFi, NFT trading, or investing/utilizing other tokens on the blockchain bear the brunt of this. It also gives people on the outside who could be looking to onboard into crypto pause because the barrier to entry has increased so much. Others who have dogged and hated on crypto as well are given more ammunition to argue against the cause.¬†¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments can be made either way about the meme token craze and its impact. I am torn between the pros and cons since I love seeing people secure a nice bag odds are new and inexperienced people are the ones who are going to be left holding the bag when the PEPE craze fads as meme token crazes always do. If you made money on PEPE congrats that is amazing! Looking forward though it just seems like it might end up doing more harm than good to the overall crypto industry.¬†¬†",49,211,2023-05-07 02:37:29,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

"Twitter user should be a multi millionaire because he invested $1500 in PEPE on April 16, but bought the wrong PEPE and ended up getting rugged","The Twitter user Castillo Trading heard about PEPE early and bought $1500 worth of PEPE mid April, around the launch. He thought he earned a ton of money only to come home after the weekend and realizing that he bought the wrong PEPE coin. He was incredibly disappointed.

Since then, however, PEPE has continued its insane run all the way to a $1.67 billion market cap. Castillo Trading did not try again and is now feeling sick to his stomach, knowing that he lost his chance of becoming a multi millionaire.

Why you don‚Äôt have to listen to people on this sub all the time,"Obviously there are a lot of experts on here who have made decent amounts of profit but please remember that isn‚Äôt everyone. Also, they might have limited experience or even lost a lot of their money in scams or shitcoins, or perhaps they even trusted the wrong exchange. 

For some posters there biggest crypto asset might be their moons earned from this subreddit. So you might want to take peoples advice with a pinch of salt.

According to Lending Tree: (In a crypto survey where participants took part in a survey posted in Jan ‚Äò23). The survey is about retail investors:

38% of Investors Have Lost More Money Than Made It

Some who've braved the crypto waters have dove deep. After removing the top and bottom 1% of survey respondents, the average amount invested in crypto ‚Äî according to our research ‚Äî is $7,738, with a median of $500. Many people have a set amount of money they're able and/or willing to invest. 

Disclaimer, I do not own much in the way of crypto and now hold only BTC in my portfolio. 

I read on this subreddit not to trust Binance, but for me as someone with only a small amount on the exchange it‚Äôs been worth it. 

I understand the concern, ‚Äúnot your keys, not your crypto‚Äù but really if you‚Äôre only holding a small amount, I think you can take the risk and not buy a ledger (which is fairly expensive in itself). 

I also read that you should not buy PEPE as it‚Äôs a meme coin and the gas fees will eat you alive. Then another poster posted about how PEPE was being brought to Binance. 
They also warned not to buy PEPE. 

I bought PEPE as a short term hold and sure enough it dipped a fair amount yesterday. Then after that it jumped back to its original price and more recently (a couple of hours ago) it jumped up to 10-11%. 

Then I swapped PEPE to BTC and accrued some more Bitcoin than I would have had by simply buying BTC. 

So, I‚Äôm not saying shitcoins or memecoins are worth holding for any amount of time or even worth purchasing but I will tell you that people who think they are completely right about every topic about crypto are not always on the ball as you might think. They might even have been a bag holder for Solana or might have bought into Bitconnect many moons ago, but you rarely hear about those stories. 

TL:DR People don‚Äôt know fuck about shit, even on this subreddit. Although, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre all early and congrats to the people who have made it already, but the reality is a lot of people are bag holders or shrimps.

This $0.0000014 level is where Pepe had topped out before breaking out Thursday and running significantly higher. Now that we are coming down to test this $0.0000014 support level (past resistance becomes new support) I believe we could see Pepe hold and move higher off this level. The massively overbought condition according to RSI have subsided as well and we are now coming down to oversold levels for RSI which currently sits at 39 (30 is oversold).

Meme coin curiosity,"Okay this post is purely out of curiosity and speculation. I don‚Äôt know a lot about investing in crypto other than the fact that you can do it through an exchange, wallet, or a ledger of some kind. I‚Äôm not a complete idiot, maybe just a little bit of one, but I‚Äôve always seen the meme coin success stories and thought‚Ä¶. ‚Äúdang that would be cool to do one day.‚Äù I made the mistake of putting some in doge back in the day so I really don‚Äôt want to burn money and do that again‚Ä¶ but my question is: 

How do people research and find these super low, unheard of coins? Where are they? And most importantly, if they‚Äôre not listed on big exchanges, how do you invest in them? I really have no idea how people are finding Pepe at a fraction of a dollar, investing, and selling all before it‚Äôs mainstream and listed on popular sites. 

I realize you‚Äôre all geniuses on here so this question is like an insult, however the internet isn‚Äôt telling me much and I‚Äôm no trying to click on a scam link just to answer this question for myself so I figured people on here would know.",2,34,2023-05-08 12:24:47,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

Someone just paid 64 ETH ($119K) in gas fees trying to buy a meme coin with 84 ETH ($156K),"Today, a user tried to buy a meme coin with 84 ETH on Uniswap and paid 64.01 ETH in transaction fee.

While at face value it seems like an accident, various people are arguing that this was a voluntary move. Apparently he tried to buy some coin named FOUR and is *up* on the trade. But I cannot get this confirmed.

Projects Like PePe gets listed within a month on all exchanges is exactly what's wrong with this space,"Pepe is pulling a rug right now, it's down like 30% on daily, it has no utility, 100 bucks website, shitty contract yet its listed on all major exchanges.

A lot of people jumped onto it after it got promoted like crazy with paid influencers and news channels, so many people fomoed in because of all the hype, many first time crypto users have bought the top and now they will never see it again, they will go tell others how crypto is a scam and all. 

Who profited the most?

Devs
Exchanges 
Influencers 
News channels 
And of course some early buyers.

Majority of people will lose money with it. This is not what crypto supposed to be like, serious projects with real utility doesn't even get this much support, these exchanges would not list them because low volume = no profits and these projects dont have enough to bribe for fast rrack listings, people will not support them because there are no 10x 100x or 1000x to gain. 

This is absolute shit show.

PEPE Meme Coin Craze Spreads Wealth to Ethereum Validators Running Blockchain,,1,2,2023-05-08 22:54:55,,CryptoCurrency,üü¢ ANALYSIS
"No, you cannot get rich from simply creating a new memecoin. You need liquidity first.","I've been seeing a bunch of posts about just how 'easy' it is to create a new memecoin in under 1 minute, and it made me realize this sub really seems to struggle with the concept of liquidity.  

You can create any new smart contract at any point you want, but nobody can trade anything for your newly minted memecoin until you add liquidity to a DEX.  

**THIS MEANS YOU NEED TO HAVE MONEY TO MAKE MONEY**

To prove my point, lets take a look at PEPE.

Here we can see the contract for PEPE was created about 25 days ago as of this post.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2afae7763487e60b893cb57803694810e6d3d136186a6de6719921afd7ca304a](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2afae7763487e60b893cb57803694810e6d3d136186a6de6719921afd7ca304a)

[Creating 420,690,000,000,000 PEPE cost around 0.037 ETH](https://preview.redd.it/0hj7qy76yoya1.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0c3925c447357ebc944daabd8afac51529f8d4)

The PEPE Deployer address has only 1 other transaction before creating PEPE, and it was a transfer from Bybit for 2.2 ETH.  This transaction happened approximately 9 hours before creating PEPE.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x242b41990d2ab19c10666e7c4c5514f8eb1afa6e20f12a9e65431dde131311e3](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x242b41990d2ab19c10666e7c4c5514f8eb1afa6e20f12a9e65431dde131311e3)

[2.2 ETH sent to PEPE deployer contract before deployment](https://preview.redd.it/cxl86tslyoya1.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1056b1698f25e491038ef46c6cc3de106999b03)

This 2.2 ETH was subsequently used to fund the liquidity pool in Uniswap, thus a memecoin is born.

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x273894b35d8c30d32e1ffa22ee6aa320cc9f55f2adbba0583594ed47c031f6f6](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x273894b35d8c30d32e1ffa22ee6aa320cc9f55f2adbba0583594ed47c031f6f6)

[2 ETH and 391,662,390,000,000 PEPE go into a Uniswap pool](https://preview.redd.it/wnn2fap9zoya1.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d59d6bd540ef39adb5e6efabb61fe93e1bc132e6)

So PEPE could have been just another completely useless smart contract, if it weren't for the creator putting 2 ETH into a pool so that you can actually purchase the tokens.

And for brevity sake, here is the timeline of events in one screenshot:

Pepe News You MUST Know!!,"Potential Coinbase listing - I think coinbase is waiting till Pepe finally cools out a bit which has for sure happened over the past couple weeks. Also Coinbase likely doesnt want to list a extremely volatile coin right before a major event in the crypto market that will likely cause a massive spike in volatility. That massive event is CPI. 

Inflation reading (CPI/PPI) - We get inflation news tm in the morning at 8:30. This is probably the most significant economic data point we will get for the next month for risk assets. If we see inflation come in below expectations we could see a massive run in risk assets with crypto being a major beneficiary of that. We have seen over the past couple days the correlation between Pepe and the general Crypto be very strong therefore if we get a large move higher in crypto tm I suspect we could see Pepe outperform. The opposite is true as well, if we get inflation above expectations this would be a negative for crypto as a higher than expected inflation number would imply the FED is going to have to further constrict economic activity via more rate hikes which is seen as a major negative to any risk asset. 

[CPI \(inflation\)](https://preview.redd.it/cz5klwpj1vya1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb4b92c115f292e7be988673c497e950479412a)

Major Support - Pepe bounced once again around $0.0000017 which is nearing the long term support at $0.0000014 which is about where Pepe had bottomed yesterday and is where Pepe had broken out on May 4th.

Recent rise of meme coins expose bag dumpers and low morale influencers !,"
Recent rise of meme coins exposes a lot of people / entities of their money grabbing greedy nature with no morale at all. 

I am personally quite sad that my used-to-be favorite youtube channels who were once produce quality contents and still have 2M+ subs shilling PEPE just right after Binance list it( clearly an attempt to dump the subscribers). 

Even they got some of us in this sub (you know you did it). 

No matter how exchanges said they are very careful with due diligence with listing process, customer safety and whatever , their decisions to list that coin EXPOSE them that They don't Care after all aside Trading Fees and Traffic. 

We should appreciate those _ 

- CryptoTubers who doesn't cover that shitcoin, even if they did, they did it as news . 
- Exchanges that don't list them 
- Awesome r/cc redditors who speak out against that shitcoin since the start

"Why Do Developers Create Popular Meme Coins On Ethereum Mainnet Despite Complaints About High Gas Fees From The Majority Of The Investors? Possible Reasons Like Legitimacy, Liquidity, And Forced HODL Explained.","Hi everyone,

In the past weeks we saw a lot of meme coins popping up and it turned in to a hype. Yet the majority of these tokens are on Ethereum mainnet which has a lot of gas fees or swapping fees on DEX. Especially when there is a lot of activity on Ethereum mainnet which drives the gas fees up further. But there are a lot of cheaper solutions like L2 solutions which are overlooked for some reason. In this post I try to explain why creators still chose to use Ethereum mainnet.

**An example is the popular meme coin Pepe:**

[CoinMarketCap Pepe information and price chart](https://preview.redd.it/vpm4ptoab1za1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f01dae70ce5d31bb4ca40d2b8ab752d2c3a5d79)

**The three possible reasons (in my opinion) why developers create meme coins on Ethereum mainnet are the following:**

**1) Legitimacy** 

In the crypto world, Ethereum mainnet is considered one of the most robust chains out there. Additionally, it can make it for example easier for developers to implement complex tokenomics for some particular memecoins. The Ethereum foundation also keeps upgrading their chain. Beside these arguments there are a more legit tokens on Ethereum than on BSC for example. 

Another advantage is that almost all CEX support Ethereum mainnet, so it's easier for popular meme coins to get listed on big CEX like Binance. For example if a popular meme coin would pop up on Arbitrum Nova it wouldn't list that easy/fast on well-known CEX.

**2) Liquidity** 

Ethereum has a lot of liquidity out there since it's the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and it has a big user base. Many whales hold Ethereum in their hot wallets, making it easier for them to buy these tokens with the liquidity in their wallets. Many of these whales are not willing to bridge their ETH to ETH on Arbitrum Nova, for example, just because of the hassle. Don't forget that bridges like Orbiter also have a certain amount of liquidity to bridge, so this could stop a whale from spending (more) money on a particular token.

**3) Forced HODL**

Many smaller investors (or gamblers) only want to invest a small amount of money just in case the tokens pumps. What happens next is that if the token doesn't perform that well, it will cost more in gas fees to convert than the actual value of their holdings to swap back for ETH. This way a lot of ETH stay in the pool and prevents a bigger price drop. This way investors are forced HODLing their meme coin and could potential lead to exit liquidity for whales.

I hope this post gave you some more info on the possible reasons why developers chose Ethereum to create meme coins.

**Why do you guys think that developers/creators chose Ethereum mainnet as chain for popular meme coins?**

We were told a that a Bear Market will ‚Äúclean‚Äú the market from all of those scams and shitcoins. Now we can see that this was clearly not true‚Ä¶,"As a person myself that was present in the Crypto market since 2021 and saw our transition of Bull Market top to Bear market from very close on. Back then, during the first talks of the possible start for a proper Bear Market, there were a lot of expectations. Obviously many negative ones, but some even wanted to turn the narrative into the positives.

One of those were about the good side of the Bear Market, the possible ‚Äúcleansing‚Äú of the scams, shitcoins and frauds in our Crypto space. This narrative was especially augmented when we saw the collapse of LUNA, wich was also in the early days of the Bear Market. Then everyone seem to be so sure that this is just the beginning of the ‚Äúflush-out‚Äú for Crypto, which at the end will actually be good for all of us.

Now after about over one year and a few more collapses and actually many Cryptos dying out like ONE, everyone would be thinking the crypto space has been cleaned, but this is clearly not the case. We are having our first meme coin/shitcoin season since the bull market just right now. With shitcoins like PEPE pumping so much that it is in market cap even above our favourites like ALGO. So obviously that so-called cleaning did not happen.

Why could that possibly be? Well, the main reason is that Crypto has matured a lot and now we are actually even in the mainstream. Bitcoin is trending about every week on Twitter, people actually do know about Crypto now. So I think that those shitcoins won‚Äòt ever stop from pumping, we are just now at a new level of adoption, where we have no way back.",240,286,2023-05-10 20:01:56,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Surging Staking Rewards Rate Generates Record $46M Earnings for Ethereum Validators,"Validators on Ethereum earned a staggering $46 million in the first week of May thanks to a surge in staking rewards rate, which represents the annualized yield of validators. This was a 40% increase from the previous week's earnings of $33 million, with validators receiving 24,997 Ether (ETH) in rewards.

The rise of the Pepe memecoin has been a driving force behind the surge in fees on the Ethereum network, with average fees exceeding 100 gwei for the first time since May 2022. As a result, end users are paying over $30 per swap, resulting in increased fee income for validators in addition to their regular rewards.

To participate in Ethereum's consensus process, validators are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which is currently valued at approximately $58,000. The current staking rate reflects the expected annualized return for validators. According to Beaconcha.in, validators earned this impressive income by processing transactions on the network.

ETH Store, a company that measures reward rates, has identified two types of rewards for Ethereum validators: consensus rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, and transaction fees for processing network transactions.

The Ethereum network's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with The Merge in the past year, coupled with the Shapella upgrade that enabled validator withdrawals, has elevated the significance of ETH staking for institutions.",3,11,2023-05-10 22:53:20,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS

Best/any resource that gathers crypto centralization data?,"Is there any good resource that compiles crypto centralization data? I‚Äôm specifically looking to compare which of my bags are still significantly held by the founding team (XLM, IOTA, ALGO, etc.), and see if there are any promising cryptos I‚Äôm not holding that are actually decently decentralized.

That‚Äôs really my TLDR question. The following is a lot of word vomit on the reason I‚Äôm asking, so feel free to stop reading here unless you‚Äôre really bored or trying to avoid work like I am. Anyway‚Äî

My crypto holdings are mostly BTC at this point, with 0.5-2% bags of a dozen alts (Crypto Jesus and his 12 Altpostles, if you will, though you probably shouldn‚Äôt). While I will always have a fondness for alts, having gotten lucky essentially revenge investing in previous Reddit darlings like VET and ADA through the 2018 bear, I do want to start fully offloading the ones that are still heavily centralized even after over a decade of crypto‚Äôs existence. 

It‚Äôs still a very young market, but I feel that, in a similar way to how shareholders are really beginning to hold companies accountable for ESG, particularly shitty governance, cryptoholders will eventually say enough is enough and stop condoning centralized blockchains, which is just an oxymoron at the end of the day. I know that day is years away, seeing that stuff like PEPE still happening, but I might as well get ahead of it now since I‚Äôm getting old and tired of dealing with crypto‚Äôs growing pains.

And listen, I wasn‚Äôt immune to the hype either‚ÄîI was convinced by the claims of impressive technology, such as a vastly superior TPS (though that‚Äôs not as difficult to achieve on a centralized ledger). I was convinced by the impressive partnerships being formed (though that‚Äôs not as difficult to achieve if you‚Äôre essentially giving away your crypto for free or for pennies on the dollar to convince companies to use or even just explore using your crypto).

Like I said, I got lucky with some alts, which more than made up for ~~duds~~non-performers that I also kept investing in like ICX and IOTA. I get it, the tech for a lot of these cryptos is still really impressive, which is why I bought in the first place. 

But the road to hell is paved with great technology with good intentions. I‚Äôm no longer impressed by soon‚Ñ¢ or ‚Äúgame-changing‚Äù updates with cool names that people will continue to not use, except for corporations and institutions that are being paid to use the network, and people who want to buy non-fungible rights to GIFs, play games using decades-old graphics and gaming technology (but on the blockchain!), or receive 10% yearly staking/governance rewards on coins that have depreciated 90% in a year. 

Crypto almost entirely relies on the network effect to create value, and even in the tech world today, promises of ‚Äúeye-watering value created by network effects‚Äù are no longer flying with VCs and other investors. I‚Äôve worked for a long time at a tech company that went public a few years ago, and investors today are really looking for tangible results instead of grandiose promises of potential. Our company also has a significant investor that is struggling financially, so even though we keep beating expectations and producing results quarter after quarter, it‚Äôs really hard for us to bring on new big investors because they don‚Äôt want to be the lube for the whale looking to take a massive dump (another reason why I‚Äôm wary now of coins with significant foundation holdings. I get that the creators need to be paid, but I don‚Äôt want to be the one paying a dollar for a penny of current value plus the potential to make a gazillion dollars in the future. I‚Äôm happy to reduce potential profits to reduce risk and wait until the founding team shows tangible results that they‚Äôre building a viable and growing network that could compete or coexist with BTC and ETH).

I know I‚Äôm sounding really negative right now, but I still truly believe in the vision of blockchain technology, in the same way I still believe in the vision of the U.S., even if the current execution seems FUBAR. 

I‚Äôll try to shut my trap and wrap this up‚Äî

TLDR: Is there a good resource that provides info on tokenomics (specifically founding team holdings) for a variety of coins, or are there any promising decentralized cryptos out there?",1,4,2023-05-11 02:33:47,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

"Coinbase needs to fall, but not fail","I will start by saying this: I am not a fan of $PEPE. I spent exactly $0 on $PEPE, I hold none, I plan to hold none, I thought it was useless at the end of April when I first heard of it and I still think it's a useless $SHIB off-shoot. 

However, despite my personal feelings on it, [what Coinbase did](https://twitter.com/SpottieWiFi/status/1656450587683086336) was wholly unethical. To leverage your market capture as the leading crypto on/off ramp as a means to gatekeep a project is wrong. It really highlights the need for more on/off ramps and a severe bottleneck of the industry at-large.

An erroneous and asinine take on a popular internet meme used by #bothsides extensively... all for the sake of a hollow virtue signal is stupid. Not to mention it put investors/speculators (primarily new) at substantial risk. For what? 

I hope this serves as a wakeup call for the industry. It's nuts how easily one entity can potentially kill a half-billon+ project based on feels. The last thing this industry needs is more gatekeepers. Anything that goes against decentralization, to me, is antithetical to the point of crypto.

Coinbase - Obviously most of you know Coinbase came out today and said Pepe is a symbol of hate. This is clearly a short-term negative for Pepe, but I believe the press and controversy this will cause will put Pepe in front of people who would of never known about Pepe. There is an old saying in media, ""*all press is good press*"" I believe this will reign true especially given #deletecoinbase is trending on Twitter right now. Coinbase messed up big time, and their competitors such as Gemni (who is the only legal exchange in NY besides Coinbase) will pat themselves on the back in weeks to come as volume jumps on their platform.

Is it dumb to invest in Doge?,"It's probably the second or third most well-known coin in the world mainly due to the hype it accumulated. It's still sitting in the top 10 by market cap even after a long time of a bear market. I think it's safe to say that you could invest in it a bit because inevitably people are going to ape into it again. Right now it's sitting at 1/10th of its ATH which, to me at least, could mean that it could 10x again.

I know it's a pretty useless coin, but to be honest the most important aspect of a coin is for it to get **hype**, at least that's how I see it... I mean look at Pepe, everyone, especially mainstream people, sees crypto as coins with pretty logos and they'll invest in whatever they think makes them money, which is why I was thinking of getting a bit of Doge every now and then. What do you say? I think it's a gamble, but a safe gamble to say the least.

Coinbase states that pepe is a symbol of hate for alt right groups. Pepe isn't even listed on Coinbase yet so it's surprising they sent out an email about it lol. I think the movement is strong enough to get the attention of Coinbase so let's see what happens next.

Is there any credibility left in the crypto space?,"Many people love to speak like if there is something good in this space. Besides the fast transactions and low fees for moving money around, is there something good left in this space? 

Shit coins. Alt coins turning into nothing. Scams everywhere. Big exchanges bankrupt every couple of months. Inside trading. Stable coins losing its peg. CeFi platforms destroyed. One man tweeting a meme and sending a coin 11,000 % up, NFTs of rocks selling for millions. Youtubers, influencers and people listening to them (not sure what is worst), multiple copies of projects released on a daily basis, hacks all over the place, zero utility, Web3 nonsense, metaverse and virtual land selling for hundreds of thousands and a year later no one cares any longer.

I think the whole idea of crypto had an interesting point when BTC came out. As for today that idea no longer exists because the whole space has been taken over by kids, crypto bros, moon bois, losers and scammers. I'm not saying the traditional financial system works. but I'm wondering if we have any credibility left. How do we really evolve the space into something more serious. Specially for new people trying to get in. Some talk about mass adoption? Are we not really far away from that? 

And for the people outraged because of Pepe, more will come. We have one like that every year. As I said before besides fast transactions and low fees, what do we really have that can make a change?",8,132,2023-05-11 10:22:44,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
Pepe the Frog meme creator and copyright owner Matt Furie weighs in on the memecoin mania and says he's a Dogecoin maxi,"A bunch of self-proclaimed crypto influencers got Matt Furie on their Twitter space discussion to talk about Pepe and here's what he said:

&gt; Actually, this is the first time I've heard of it. What is Pepe coin? I've heard of Ethereum, I've heard of Bitcoin, and I've heard of Dogecoin; is it like that? Dogecoin's the best. I'm a Dogecoin maxi.

https://twitter.com/enjoyoor/status/1655708365748686848

Since he has the copyright for the original Pepe the Frog meme, he has also been quite vocal against its use for cash grab NFT ponzis in the past. Sad Frogs Districts project which was among the earliest pepe-based NFT projects [was removed by OpenSea](https://decrypt.co/78788/pepe-the-frog-meme-nfts-opensea-copyright-dmca) after Furie filed a complaint against it around August of 2021. Given how many more NFT projects and coins have come up around the meme over the last month, it's going to be interesting to see if he takes any further action to protect investors.

Anyone holding anything pepe related should beware since he's pretty serious about preventing wrongful use of the meme and had also [invoked the copyright law](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/21/16333162/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-dmca-takedown-fair-use-matt-furie) to prevent alt-right meme makers from using his work for spreading hateful content in 2017.

My own prediction for Pepe 2050 is that it'll be almost exactly 0$. The forecast doesn't take into account that most meme coins die out and become valueless in the matter of years (or sometimes days). This forecast is just assuming that it'll keep following the trends it has followed in it's short existence.

The Dark Side of Memecoins: Different Types of Ponzi Schemes,"Well, it looks that the promised ""Crypto winter will get rid of all shitcoins and memecoins"" was not totally true so we must then learn that there are different kind of ponzi schemes between memecoins.

[Memecoins](https://preview.redd.it/hbf69973r8za1.png?width=1801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6ea5e968c07b30fed68389d0c2a9748d9468b5)

Personally I distinguish two types of ponzi schemes:

* **Long term ponzi:** The ones developed in L1 ETH that use ETH gas fees price increasing to artificially decrease sell pressure but still they slowly rug pull investors. Example: PEPE üê∏
* **Short term ponzi:** The ones developed in Binance Scam Chain (BSC) which when they reach a marketcap the scammers think is fine, they rug pull investors in an instant. Example: SQUID ü¶ë
* **Chameleon ponzi:** The ones that change the strategy from short term to long term or otherwise. Example: SAFEMOON üåï which are in BSC but changed their strategy to long term ponzi probably because they saw they created a cult.

Opinion: This is getting ridiculous,"So, just going to share a little story and opinion from an amateur bag holder.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, it seems everything in crypto is just so scammy, it's hard to take any of it serious anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I posted about my shit bags and me contemplating what to do.  Well, out of nowhere I get a bunch of ""random"" threads posting up on my Reddit feed about this amazing coin that is about to MoOn, sO wEn LamBo?  Guess what it's Japanese! and we know how much Japanese love tech! JYes, Im taking about Jasmy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I look into it, and before I trade one shit coin for another, I remember that I suck at trading, and don't.  Good thing, because in case you haven't been keeping up, here's what's happened since threads promoting Jasmy have been randomly popping up on my feed:

&amp;#x200B;

Oh fucking noice!  That's for the heads up on something I've never heard of before Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, it seems like every day, some scandalous news shows up about crypto, or an exchange, or some scammer pumps and dumps, lawsuit against a coin or something, a guy goes to jail for buying a car with crypto...  I mean how is the average person really supposed to take anything in crypto serious these days?  

&amp;#x200B;

It becomes crazy expensive to actually use your crypto for it's original intention (if anyone actually does that) because some obvious nonsense shit called Pepe (really guys?) is clogging up the pipes so bad it takes like fifty bucks to make a transaction?  How would anyone with half a bit of objectivity and critical thinking ability really look at this and think...yeah, I can see the world totally adopting this.  Fuck my cash, I'd like 80 thousand Donkey coins please. That's the future!

Are you after the lottery ticket with possible huge returns butnanvery low chance or the slow burn, blue chip coins, not the same short term potential but a much higher chance of more sustainable long term value..

With coins like Pepe making great returns but also being touted as a 1000x return or more what do most of you want? Knowing that the chances of picking a 1000x return coin are so low.

Pepe Token Millionaire


User
Pepe is a new meme coin based on the comic book character, Pepe the frog, and has a circulation of 420,690,000,000,000, and the current market cap is $644,533,863 with the price of 0.00000154. If in a bull market, the market cap got to 250bn, how many tokens do I need to make $1m please?

ChatGPT
To calculate how many tokens you need to make $1 million, you first need to calculate the price per token at a $250 billion market cap.

To do this, you can use the formula:

price per token = market cap / circulating supply

In this case, at a $250 billion market cap, the price per token would be:

price per token = $250,000,000,000 / 420,690,000,000,000 = $0.000594

Next, you can calculate how many tokens you need to make $1 million by using the formula:

tokens required = target amount / price per token

In this case, if you want to make $1 million, you would need:

tokens required = $1,000,000 / $0.000594 = 1,682,494.95

Therefore, you would need approximately 1,682,495 tokens to make $1 million at a $250 billion market cap.

Do you think meme coins can go that high in market cap if the market was really heated? If I put in a calculated bet, and only what I can afford to lose, I won't end up behind a dumpster of a fast food place will I?

ChatGPT
It's difficult to predict with certainty what the market cap of any particular cryptocurrency, including meme coins, will be in the future. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and their values can fluctuate rapidly based on various factors such as market sentiment, adoption, and regulatory changes.

In a highly speculative and heated market, it's possible for meme coins and other cryptocurrencies to experience significant growth in market cap. However, it's important to note that such growth may not be sustainable and could be followed by a sharp decline in value.

It's always important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, comes with a high degree of risk. You should only invest what you can afford to lose and conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.

Additionally, it's always a good idea to consider the long-term potential and utility of the cryptocurrency you're investing in, rather than simply speculating on short-term price movements.





User
Do you think pepe could over take shiba inu and dogecoin with the right viral campaign on twitter, tik tok and reddit?

ChatGPT
It's difficult to predict with certainty whether Pepe could overtake Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in popularity and market cap. Both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have a significant head start in terms of adoption and recognition, and they have established communities of supporters and users.

However, viral campaigns on social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Reddit can certainly help to increase awareness and drive interest in a cryptocurrency like Pepe. These campaigns can help to generate buzz and attract new users and investors, which can in turn increase the demand and value of the cryptocurrency.

Ultimately, the success of any cryptocurrency depends on a variety of factors, including its technology, adoption, and community support. While viral campaigns can certainly help to boost awareness and interest, it's important to consider these other factors when evaluating the long-term potential of a cryptocurrency like Pepe.





User
Do you think pepe is a likeable character, more so than shiba inu and doge?

ChatGPT
As an artificial intelligence language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide information on how Pepe the frog compares to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in terms of popularity and sentiment.

Pepe the frog is a well-known internet meme character that has been around for several years, and has a large following among certain online communities. However, he has also been associated with controversial and offensive content, which has led to some negative associations with the character.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, on the other hand, are both popular cryptocurrency projects that have gained significant attention and support in the crypto community. Both have been associated with memes and have strong, dedicated communities of supporters.

In terms of likeability, the perception of a meme or character is subjective and can vary depending on personal preferences and cultural backgrounds. It's difficult to make a definitive comparison between Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin in terms of likeability, as different people may have different opinions on each.",5,5,2023-05-12 21:17:59,,Pepecryptocurrency,

"PEPE is down 24% today and 70% from the time of the Binance listing.

PEPE is already down 24% in the 24 hours for today. It is down a further 70% from the Binance listing. Further the market cap dropped from 1.8 Billion to 500 Million.

&amp;#x200B;

It is *rather interesting* how PEPE looks like a rugpull. I'm not saying it is, just commenting on the appearance.

But this is why you don't FOMO. All you end up being is exit liquidity. Everyone who got in early was simply waiting for an opportunity like this to dump on excited traders who FOMOed in. And all of a sudden, everyone who rushed to buy is suddenly down at least BIG. Even those who cut their losses early are down at least 10-15% because the price was dropping like a rock.

There were also apparently some sub users upset that the sub ""prevented"" them from participating in the big pump. You're quite free to do as you wish with whatever coin. This is just a showing, an practical example of what *could happen* if you do, or for some, *did*.",1247,773,2023-05-12 10:54:50,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

How do you get over being scammed?,"I'll start with the obvious. I know I fucked up, I know I'm an absolute moron. I don't need to hear that stuff because I am already absolutely devasted and gutted. 

I foolishly clicked on one of the many ""Pepe airdrop"" links that got spammed on here earlier in the week. I saw the ""spam"" comments, but for some reason still clicked it. I thought just connecting a wallet couldnt hurt to see. I connected my metamask wallet which was empty. nothing happened. 

For some reason I then connected my main wallet (Trustwallet), with my 0.7 eth and a few other smaller bags. Then came the prompts to approve or reject what I assume now, was the smart contract. I don't know why, or what was going on in my head. I thought it would be more clear what I was giving access to I guess. but I didn't think and clicked approve. 

nothing happens so I just closed the site and didn't think about it until 3 days later when I noticed what had happened. 

I am absolutely gutted. I know it's not a huge bag, and it's not financially crippling for me. but I just have a horrible feeling lingering in me now. how could I be so stupid. I frequent this subreddit and know the risks, but for those 2 minutes my brain didn't click. I got scammed. I'm the only one to blame. losing $2k AUD is bad, but it's more the work I put in to get that ETH, and the potential of what it could be worth one day that really hurts. 


I can't stop thinking about it. it's ruining my mood and I just can't be around anyone ATM. how do you move on from fucking up so bad?

I'm also worried about some coins I have staked that are locked for another 4 months. they will come back to my wallet and will they get drained too? I went on allowance.beefy.finance and found 2 permissions on wbtc and H20 ( 2 of the 3 coins they stole from me) and revoked them. my staked coin is not any of the coins they stole.  is that enough?",48,199,2023-05-13 03:49:35,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

HEX token crashes as Richard Harts Ethereum Fork PulseChain goes live,"After years of anticipation PulseChain the copy of eth which will give you a pulsechain copy of every ERC20 token you currently have has launched.

If you have 1,000 USDC in the Ethereum network, you now have 1,000 USDC on the Pulsechain network. 

How does the new USDC on Pulsechain have any value? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ykhhzxz6miza1.gif

If you have one of those bored ape NFTs on Ethereum well now you have one on PulseChain as well.

How does the new bored ape have any value?

So now that we have established that we don't know how new PLS versions of tokens on a fork of Ethereum have any value lets look at what is actually happening to HEX the eth token that promises to give you more HEX for locking up your current HEX without the token really doing anything other that being locked up by user to generate more HEX, where does the new HEX Value come from?

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm confused also](https://preview.redd.it/5te5uy3tmiza1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5062ac6525e785fac86d408016bc8013bbc260e9)

Anyway since Pulsechain has no actual value in it, the users are now selling off their HEX on Ethereum to move liquidity over to Pulse which is crashing the price of HEX (the token you lock up for periods of time to earn more HEX).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ysb2sh7niza1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04519bc997e2541db3f8a1f76bea4caf26e6c067

It fell more than 50% before recovering a bit and then starting to fall again.

currently down 47%

The people selling their $HEX to buy Pulsechain tokens are extremely excited right now because they are seeing the numbers on their trades in the hundreds of thousands, some are millionaires on paper right now. They do have one small problem, those numbers are based off of PUSDC which is worthless since Circle is not going to honor a copy of USDC made by Richard Hart on his own chain.

You can see some of the PulseChain tokens people are trading [here](https://dexscreener.com/pulsechain)

they are trading pulsechain copies of USDT, USDC, Dai, SHIB, PEPE, LINK 

This is going to end bad for the HEXICANS

In conclusion - it's probably better to risk your money on the next shitcoin made by a random anonymous person on twitter than investing in PulseChain.",65,191,2023-05-13 04:02:31,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS

People on this sub don't get this.,"I'll make this short and to the point. This post is about memecoins and the hate surrounding it.

Everyone is saying that the only people who profited off of pepe are insiders and early investors. In reality, normal people who didnt get any inside info actually made money on coins like pepe and doge and other shitcoins. Even i was lucky to get on the hype train at the right time and made some profit.

 As someone said, great investments doesn't always mean great businesses. This is more true in crypto.

Unless you're in it just for the tech which i highly doubt, you have no reason to hate it or the insiders who made profit off of it.
Try to understand the ongoing trend and ride the wave. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to put your money in memecoins now, but just outright hating anything won't make you learn a thing. Just look at those people in buttcoin sub as an example. Don't be like them.

I used to have difficulty understanding why so many people have a negative view on crypto and attributed this all to a lack of education.

But I notice myself getting more and more disappointed with crypto and its user base, almost like a parent that has seen his kid do something dumb a few too many times, and can understand better and better why the public has a negative view of this space.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so many scams, hacks, pump and dumps, and meme coins. Everyone is just chasing the next big hype, like the metaverse, AI coins, and now meme coins again. Who cares about fundamentals? We all know these projects are worthless but they go up anyway. Even all the news websites just focus on the dumb sides of crypto. Its all just so empty.

There's very little attention for actual use-cases and technology. And who can blame them? Crypto is so innovative yet its barely used after 15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Many users are also behaving like idiots and make silly mistakes or just engage in dumb behavior:

1. People sent $5 million in ETH this week to Ben.ETH in the most obvious rugpull in history
2. A Twitter user should have been a millionaire but gambled $1500 on the wrong PEPE because he did not check the contract address
3. A user sent $1.5 million to the wrong address
4. So many people know about the basics (self-custody, dont invest more than you can lose, etc.) but straight out ignore them
5. People were FOMOing into PEPE after over a 100x in just a few weeks.

These are all people with crypto experience! How is this ever going to get used by the public, including old people?

Watching Pepe move just like Shiba and doge,"Watching Pepe move now is such a similar pattern that all meme coins go thru. When I read that post yesterday about pepe being down 70% from it's ATH and being a rug pull or scam I got flash backs of the Shiba beginning pump days. This gives me the feeling that pepe is going to make the same crazy trajectory that Shiba and doge went thru. Both of those coins experienced extreme pump and dumps all the way to the top 10 then back down. I wouldn't be suprised if pepe does the same type of crazy moon shot that other meme coins have experienced. Pepe definitely has the same crazy community that Shiba has, maybe even crazier than Shiba to be honest. And when you join their telegram chat, you can tell they also have the same community feel as doge did. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these meme coins are clearly casino gambling but if we're honest with ourselves, so is a majority of alt coins. Some altcoins have more usecase then others but in the end investors are gambling by investing in 95% of alt coins out there. This is not financial advice or advice at all for that matter of fact, it's simply my perspective on the current pump and dump rollercoaster ride that pepe is going thru. I definitely don't think we have heard the last of this meme coin pepe, and like I said before I wouldn't be suprised if this is just the beginning of it's rollercoaster ride to the moon and then straight back down.

Boredom gets the best of us,"Hey, hey, hey! It‚Äôs me! 

So, I got a great piece of advice. Don‚Äôt get bored and stare at crypto shit all night!

So I recently had a kid (1st kid), boy. He‚Äôs great! A blessing from God! Truly my pride and joy this past 12 days that he‚Äôs been on this earth.

That being said, I get up in the midnight shift of him waking, fed, change etc. the last two nights he decided to be up for like 3-4 hours. So what do I do? Scroll Reddit, cexs and some articles here and there. 

We‚Äôll here‚Äôs the problem, boredom left me ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in this damn Pepe. Got some 130 million for like $240. I don‚Äôt need the $240 so if it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone. Here‚Äôs my logic. I just remember buying 1.2 million dogecoin for $100 and sold it for $200 back in whatever year. What‚Äôs a $240 risk? Overall, who the fuck cares or knows?! Rug pull or not, I pulled the plug and got some. 

To clarify; advice is for not ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù while bored haha not advice for investing in Pepe.",13,81,2023-05-14 10:41:36,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

"I trust Pepe, and RenQ as much as I trust Safemoon to net me a return, and FTX to keep my crypto safe on a hot wallet.","It just seems that every lunar crypto year, there is some new hype coin that promises everything for your ROI, only to net negative holding it long term. 

Also, everytime people like me warn about shit like this, it's always the same people upset ""no no, you don't know what you're talking about"" 

But I do, obviously.  If you sit around a certain sector for many years , you will eventually gain enough foresight to get a good sense of things.   I may not know what coin will make you rich , but I can easily see some that won't. That's a start.   I told you Bitcoin gold, and cash where garbage that will eventually fall off the charts slowly but surely.   I told you about safemoon, Xtrabytes , EOS, and cardano will give you negative long term.     It's always the same argument back at me.    These coins at this second might give you a return.  But once they go higher, it's never going to be the same again.  

I can't say the same thing for eth or Bitcoin.  These are cryptos that prove doubt wrong.  These are cryptos that will give you returns holding long term.  

Stay away from this new garabge if you plan to hold long term.",20,71,2023-05-14 15:26:00,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE
"Thoughts on youtubers ""backing"" meme coins?","What are your thoughts on YT'ers promoting meme/shit coins.  Do you think it's fair that if you are a (long time) follower of them and you get in early you can make a shit load of money or do you think that they should hold some kind of integrity and not help in the pump? 

Take bambi for example.  Not gonna say who they are but if you're  in the space you've heard them talk about it.  I get the same feeling as binance listing pepe. Enough (web3) projects with real use cases and good development but don't get listed because or whatever reason (pay not enough, not enough trading??)

People can say it'll bring in new buyers but why bring in new crypto enthousiasts only to see them get rekt and leave?


As much as I hate to admit, meme coins is where the money is going to be made.  No coiners would rather spend 1000 on shit coin to get 1.000.000.000 in the hope it'll hit 10 cent then buy 0.037 btc",10,130,2023-05-14 17:09:42,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Technical key levels for Pepe and Bitcoin,"
15th May 2023
PEPE key level. 

Low  0.00000100
High 0.00000200

We have recently approached the 200 level, but failed to break through this previous resistance. This did not surprise me as it usually takes a few tries, at least two or three more times. We must always see what Bitcoin does as that is always the overall influence on any crypto. I will discuss Bitcoin separately. Currently Pepe stands at 170. Patience is required now because I suspect we'll drift around the 150 to 200 area for a little bit. I generally consider 170, or 7s unlucky for the punter. 7 is used in casinos if you see 777 used on the slots. I've never actually found this lucky. You choose to go long at 7, then it will go down, you go short at 7 it will go up. So this area is no mans land. PEPEs market cap stands at $717m. Edit.. WTF I just noticed more 7s there...

Bitcoin Key Level.
Low 20,000
High 30,000

Bitcoin since the start of this year has been quietly advancing from the 20,000 lows. We hit a ceiling at a major round number of 30,000. We then drifted down to 29,000 and held there for a while. Then we had a bit of a sell off lately, and BTC stands at 27,xxx. Note it is also in the 7s too. This is weakness and patience is required for the bulls to recover their strength to attack the 30,000 ceiling once more. BTC market cap is $533bn.",3,27,2023-05-15 18:21:51,,Pepecryptocurrency,

[SATIRE] Creators of PEPE start a new crypto project as a way of atoning for their pump and dump sins: POPE,"The PEPE creators feel very sad and embarrassed because their shitcoin pumped to a market cap of $1.7 billion in a month and then dumped over 70% in a few days, thereby hurting a lot of retail investors. The PEPE creators are aware that the price of PEPE will go to $0 because PEPE is just another shitcoin without any utility. Real sorry they are.

But they have come up with a plan to atone for their crypto sins and help the people out that got hurt by the PEPE project: POPE. **POPE is an innovative cryptocurrency that aims to help users rebuild the funds they lost with PEPE.** There are several key ways in which this will be achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ac7w6uul500b1.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a243523b86797cf91c5f7e586647245e3e4f1f9

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Aim 1: Help crypto users follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments**

Users will link their crypto wallets/accounts in a very safe and secure manner, allowing a team of expert Christian moderators recruited from this subreddit to check whether users follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments. These 10 Holy Crypto Commandments are: 

1. Self-custody your crypto
2. Dollar cost average (buy slowly)
3. Make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and POPE a significant part of your portfolio
4. Do not FOMO or panic sell
5. Do not invest more than you can lose
6. Take profits (during the bull market)
7. Do not listen to shillers on social media
8. Dont advertise your crypto holdings online
9. Do not store your seed online
10. Do not click (suspicious) links

Users who follow these 10 Holy Crypto Commandments will be rewarded in several ways. First of all, following these Commandments should be a reward in and of itself. We know that users struggle to be good but following these 10 simple steps should prevent you from getting scammed, hacked, or duped by pump and dumps. 

Another way will be explained in Key Aim 2.

https://preview.redd.it/2abqlbxd700b1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48d207423a982a37acb9623f78716676a3f12fe

**Key Aim 2: Reward those who follow the 10 Holy Crypto Commandments with 7 Heavenly Virtues Tokens**

We will use a part of the money we earned by scamming our loyal frog followers with PEPE to airdrop seven tokens on the POPE blockchain. These are the 7 Heavenly Virtues Crypto Tokens. These tokens are:

1. Chastity Token
2. Tmperance Token
3. Charity Token
4. Diligence Token
5. Kindness Token
6. Patience Token
7. Humility Token

The tokens will be airdropped once per quarter to those who follow the 10 commandments. The first token that will be released is Chastity Token, after three months of good behavior. This process repeats itself until in the 7th quarter, Humility Token is distributed. This will be the most rare one because we expect some people to have difficulty following the Commandments.

Having ability to chose between multiple different coins is benefitial for crypto community. Monopoly of one or two projects wouldn't be good. No single coin can be good for everything.,"Many people act like world would be better if we would have just BTC or maybe additionaly ETH too, and that most other coins are¬† totally unnecessary. It is like trying to find panaca to cure all diseases. Anyone who know even basics about medicine know one remedy can't cure everything and most likely would harm you. Simmilar in any business, one computer or one car can't be for literally everything, cause there are different usecases.

In crypto BTC or ETH are store of value, cool, safe, well respected, but also a hassle to use, very expensive, not fast enough, not private enough. That's why we have¬† Monero for privacy and Matic, Nano or XLM for cheap and fast transfers. Additionaly multiple other coins for different purposes. Sometimes multiple coins for one purpose, cause they¬†¬†often try to solve one problem in different ways and give investors ability to chose solution they personally like the best. For example I use Matic for transfers, cause I also use Opensea, so it is two birds with one stone. Other person may like different coin to do transfers, but what is most important everyone have a choice.

Even disliked memecoins have their place in crypto world, memes are huge part of modern internet. Average guy that buy doge, shiba, pepe or other memecoins won't buy BTC or ETH, cause they don't want store of value, they want funny community with memes and hopium. It is just different niche, that is fulfilled in crypto. Without memecoins most of those money wouldn't be in crypto at all, cause, using comparation,  even if you would forbid videogames, average gamer would't become book reader. People should stop acting some projects are better others are bad. Mire coins generally are heatlhy, mean less monopoly, more adoption and drive innovation. If we would have 2 or 3 coins in total, we would be years backward in terms of tech and usecases.",22,47,2023-05-15 17:05:31,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

PEPE banned address with millions,"[https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html](https://thenationview.com/cryptocurrency/185041.html)

Basically PEPE Dev banned an address with more than 20 millions BRL (about 4 million dollars) in PEPE because the address seems to be linked with MEV Bots. The address purchased a total of 120 dollars of PEPE in Uniswap after 8 minutes it was deployed, but was banned very shortly after the purchase.

The address cannot send or receive anything, it done for good.

This is horrible, it goes against everything crypto intended.

Imagine beliving in a crypto where the Dev literally has a switch to ban any address they want? ""Decentralization"".

Edit: My mistake, it was 20 millions BRL not dollars, in dollars it would be about 4 millions dollars, still a lot of money.",21,35,2023-05-15 21:40:11,,CryptoCurrency,GENERAL-NEWS

Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop listening good advice and invest in meme coins?,"I‚Äôve been balls deep in crypto for 3 years now, I‚Äôm thankful because this motivated me to do a coding bootcamp and I have a brand new very useful skill now. It also motivated me to get a second job and use that extra money to buy crypto. 
I invest 50% BTC and 50% small MC coins. I do my research on these for days before I buy and make sure they have a use case and the founder is not a scammer. Here is the thing though, none of these small MC tokens is going anywhere. Even the projects with the best looking future is designed to make the founder and devs get rich first and people like me who find it first are bag holders for years before we see any returns if ever. Whereas for meme coins, people who are always reading and doing research will make less than the founders and devs but will also get good profits when the general public starts buying and the MC reaches $100mil+ . Knowing that I could have made lots of money on PEPE if I didn‚Äôt have this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than meme coins‚Äù attitude doesn‚Äôt feel right. What do you think?

- Just because a crypto x100, doesn‚Äôt mean it will continue to climb- many times you‚Äôre at the top and will dump hard (PEPE just dumped 60% in a matter of days) 

- Many coins in the top 100 will never reach ATH again (many of which are inflationary) 

- Those shilling coins are most likely using you as exit liquidity (hate to say this about our beloved moons.. but it‚Äôs most likely true) 

- Some of the coins that never get hyped and fly under the radar are some of the best. **Monero**

Retail traders were mostly absent from Pepecoin‚Äôs (PEPE) stellar rise to $1.5 billion market cap in a few weeks, even as the token snagged billions of dollars in daily volumes and a host of copycats.

This comes from a new report by on-chain analytics firm Santiment. Santiment compared the liquidity and trading metrics for pepecoin against shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE) ‚Äì tokens themed after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed that was once worth a cumulative $160 billion at peak.

Santiment said that while dogecoin and shiba inu hit trading volumes of $70 billion and $40 billion respectively at peak, pepecoin managed a comparatively lesser $2 billion.

A big factor here, however, is that pepecoin raked up such volumes in the midst of a bear market ‚Äì one that‚Äôs marred with generally lower liquidity as key market makers scaled back crypto trading plans. This opens up the potential for future growth when overall market conditions are better.",9,0,2023-05-18 18:39:48,,Pepecryptocurrency,

Coinbase Listing Pepe Coin? Rumors Abound As Countdown Timer Surfaces

What kind of coins did you mainly buy?,"According to my observations, there are a few types of coins depending on their market movement and utility. 

1. Bitcoin - first cryptocurrency, king of our hearts, leading the market since its creation.

2. Coins that show potential and deliver - projects like Ethereum that are promising novelties, solutions to problems, etc. and actually deliver good services and have great developers. This shows in their market trends as they usually make their way upwards over a longer period.

3. Coins that show potential but fail to deliver - Not all coins are scams. I do believe that some projects really mean to develop as solutions to some problems and are planning to upgrade the existing tech. Unfortunately as the time goes, their roadmap gets posponed and postponed. They might deliver but in a very stretched timeframe. Eventually people lose interest in them and only the religious bag holders still hope for the project's development.

4. Meme coins ""pump and dump"" - we all know these, they usually dont last long on the market, developers hype people into buying and then sell their bags, usually leaving other holders unable to even sell for loss.

5. Meme coins that pump and dump and then somehow stay there - Im talking about Dogecoin for example. First meant as a total meme, but now has its own blockchain and even some utility. For some it is not considered a meme coin anymore. Pepe might be going in this direction?

Are there some that I missed? Which types do you hold/prefer?",28,293,2023-05-18 08:40:28,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

"Shitcoiners are stealing the work of the Nyan Cat Creator, who even told them to stop to stop using his own. BitBoy team even promoted that scam afterwards.","It really seems like no day in Crypto goes without some shitcoin being spawned out of the nowhere and with the only intention to make the creators rich by the money of people who stupidly even invest in such a scam. But what is even worse than all of thise shitcoins? Yeah, shitcoins that are illegally stealing the work of other creators to promote their own ‚Äúmeme‚Äú and make money with it.

After PEPE the meme coins race was on and it was inevitable to now have shitcoins of all those memes. One of them is the well known Nyan Cat meme, which even had a quite successful Gen 3 Avatar from Reddit. Now the Nyan Meme Coin ($NYAN) was created, which is using the artwork of the actual creator of the Nyan Cat, PRguitarman.

He here even called up to the meme coin creators to stop with this, but they did not listen at all and just continued. Later we even had the team of BitBoy directly promote that art-stealing shitcoin and we all by now know that they just take money to shill any kind of a shitcoin.

Here we see another promotion of a sh\*tcoin that is **highly** likely to be a future rugpull. The screenshot ""shows"" that the transaction was sponsored by the PEPE Deployer. This is supposed to give legitimacy to the project...since it's done by the same devs who did PEPE and that this project can give similar returns and so is trustworthy(or something like that I can only imagine). 

But then we come if we use the transaction hash and view the transaction for ourselves, we come to this page.

Are the stars aligning for PEPE?,"
I have been in the markets for over 20 years and made over six figures in that time. I still work part-time as I don't take too many big risks. I enjoy life... life is short. You won't see me posting my account blow ups on WSB sub reddit though, too many people mis price risk. I am not selling a trading course or giving any advice.  I am not a day trader, although I do visit that sub reddit.

I have seen many things in my time. The housing boom and bust. The Great Financial Crisis. The pandemic boom stocks. The crypto boom. The commodity boom of 2011. The Energy crisis. And now the great inflation. There is an AI boom building, but I don't feel there is much opportunity with any small companies to put money in.

I do feel the stars are aligning with Pepe. All the right pieces are coming together. I am getting older now and want to not YOLO on Pepe, but I want to get behind it as I do think there is some good potential with it between now and the 2024 US election. I will be adding to my Pepe pot each month. I am excited for its potential, and you should be too. I was there when Bitcoin was $50. But I didn't get behind it enough. This is my big regret. But Pepe will be the redemption!

It's up to all of you people to get behind Pepe!

We have Elon Musk, and various other youtubers, influencers, Tik Tokers getting behind Pepe. Then we have the exchanges and maybe just maybe big funds.

I feel this is the big one. 

There isn't much more happening with Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, I feel. They had their run. They had their 15 minutes of glory.  I have asked a few younger people if they heard of Pepe. The answer is either no... or they have forgotten about their crypto. This is how bad this crypto winter is now. If you believe in market cycles, summer will be around again. It is inevitable.

I was speaking to an active crypto trader who makes money doing this as a hustle. He's not heard of Pepe. He will get back to me. I will find out if he is a bitcoin maximalist from his response. Don't close your mind to opportunity because of biases. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are proof that crypto is not exclusive but inclusive.

I don't know if I am in an echo chamber.... but I do feel we are first with Pepe. Sure, the founders make their fortunes. They deserve it. Pepe is out there now. 

There are three ways to make money in this business....

1. Be first, and it 'll be easy to be first!

2. Be smart, and it is difficult to be smart.

3. Cheat! And I don't cheat!",17,7,2023-05-20 06:21:01,,Pepecryptocurrency,

Its crazy to think a meme coin got a billion ""invested"" into it in less than 20 days. 
Part of the issue is the hype train and FOMO that happens when something takes off but I think a majority of the blame is also on exchanges that are willing to list something obviously a meme and most probably a rugpull.

There are other projects that have been around for a much longer time and with a lot more utility than Pepe or SHIB but because of the publicity and hype the exchanges are just rushing to list these shitcoins. 

Pepe is anon, has no utility, no white paper and no real practical use execpt to fleece those FOMOing. 

Should exchanges be held to a standard at all? Or is it just going to be everyone chasing the money?",51,141,2023-05-21 10:50:01,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Hardware comparing Model T vs Nano X,"So due to what happened with Ledger, I wanted to do some research for the Model T and see how it holds up against the Nano X.

Before we get into a deep dive. I want to mention the cyber security problem on both sides.

Ledger: Now it's known you can take the seed from the hardware wallet through a firmware update. It should be noted that Ledger is walking back what it did, but there is always a risk a hacker can push out a bad firmware update. The only problem however is unless if they had physical access to the device, and they would have to know your pin, it is extremely unlikely you would get it. But it also means if a gov wanted to. They could force such an update on the device or find their own methods.

The other security flaw is this isn't open source. But IMO this isn't a major security difference since most people don't know how to read code, and many who do don't care to sit through every update and audit it completely.

Oh and the biggest security flaw is the company lied. So who knows if this newest thing will be sneaked onto the firmware?

(Side note: many now view Ledger wallets as a hot wallet due to this entire thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Trezor: There was a vulnerability on Trezor One, Trezor Model T, KeepKey and B Wallet hardware wallets that can be exploited to force the hardware wallet to give up its seed phrase and PIN. The problem cannot be patched by a firmware update either as the vulnerability is due to a physical design flaw. However, this vulnerability has already been fixed for newer devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Security chip

The Ledger Nano X uses the ST33J2M0 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL5+ security standards. This chip provides robust security against physical and software attacks. The Trezor Model T uses the ST31H320 chip, which is certified to Common Criteria EAL6 security standards. It is also licensed by RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances).

Based on this the Model T is more secure when it comes to this.

&amp;#x200B;

# Size of the memory

Model T has 512 MB while Ledger Nano X is 1.8 MB

&amp;#x200B;

# Supported coins

Something to note is both screws with there numbers. Like they count a bulk of ETH coins in their supported coins when in reality if you support ETH likely you also support all other ERC20 tokens.

Note the table below I took the info from

[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

[https://trezor.io/coins](https://trezor.io/coins)

and had a thing help me make the table. They both support ERC20 and BEP20. Meaning any token that is that, both will support. I'm not going through every token to make sure it matches this. I'm only looking at the sites.

Kraken Circle Jerk. Kraken actually listed PEPE a week ago and no one's talking about it.,"I don't know if I just missed it but I've been literally in this sub for almost everyday for the past 2-3 weeks, I might have missed commenting but I always opened this sub everyday for news and stuff and other fun discussions. But I've never seen any news about Kraken listing PEPE for a week, now I'm here to prove a point.

So Kraken listed PEPE in May 16/17 depending on your timezone, and for some reason it didn't made news in this sub. Not in HOT page, nor in TRENDING. Then of course it's expected after all the circle jerks of ""Kraken didn't list it, Kraken the best"".

&amp;#x200B;

# First part: The Circle Jerk

https://preview.redd.it/4zqc9s2uul1b1.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd97aa48d23f0eb0977cbb17b540a9eb4406f699

**BUT luckily there are people who reject joining the kraken circle jerk and said their piece. Thank you guys!**

Obviously the Kraken shill got the most upvotes, and only a few upvotes to those actually are not talking good about kraken which is expected of this sub. As Odysseus\_Lannister said, this sub has such a hard on for Kraken.

# Second Part: The Kraken listing and blog post

Here's the reddit post in their sub about Kraken listing PEPE:

Then of course we have heroes here who called it out, and it was very fun and satisfying for me to read their comments.

Kraken is still a business, they're not your friends. Stop whoring about kraken. Unless you're a paid shill then sure, whore yourselves out.

I'm more convinced now that Kraken have some paid shills in this sub or something. Or being pro-kraken in this sub is an easy karma farming material so everyone just does it.",34,40,2023-05-23 16:25:46,,CryptoCurrency,EXCHANGES

I promise you this is at least 90% of Pepe tokens I found. It is madness. Personally I have no idea if the OG Pepe will withstand the test of time in this bear market but who knows. I just find it hilarious that there are so many Pepe tokens out there. Good stuff

EDIT: Guys, I shit you not. None of these are made up. They are all listed on Coinbase, Coin Market Cap, Coin Gecko, Binance and more. They can also obviously be found on pancake swap, uniswap, dextools and many other places. These effin things are real LOL

Market Cap of crypto categories!,"
We all use market cap from time to time as a tool to figure out which project might or might now make it to our expectations. 

Now there are 20,000 of crypto and it's hard to keep up with each coin market cap if you are investing a lot / watching a lot of crypto categories / use cases. 

So I just gonna list out crypto categories and its total market for quick read here. 

Note that a lot of coins are overlapped in categories hence adding m cap of each categories will exceed total crypto m cap today. 

1. Layer 1 (Btc, Eth, Ada, BNB etc) - $ 868 Billion Market Cap (72.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

2. Smart Contract Platform (eth, bnb,polygon, sol etc) - $364 Billion Market Cap (30.33% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

3.  Stable Coins - $130 Billion Market Cap (10.83% of Total Crypto Market Cap). 

4. Exchange Based Tokens - $71 Billion Market Cap (5.9% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

5. Defi (uni, aave, maker etc)- $36 Billion Market Cap (3% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

6. Meme Coins -  (doge, shiba, pepe etc)- $17 Billion Market Cap (1.41% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

7. NFT (sand, mana, axs etc)- $16 Billion Market Cap (1.33 % of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

8. Liquid Staking Tokens  (lido, rocket etc)- $15 Billion Market Cap (1.25% of Total Crypto Market Cap).  

This is it, from my pov, Liquid Staking Tokens are climbing up the M Cap ladder of the crypto and might deserve a spot at 7 or 6.

"PEPE site homepage has a frog, pants down butt out and pissing on memecoin logos. PEPE pumps and dumps multiple times everyday. The same PEPE that is by far one of the most well-known and easily in top 100 most valuable tokens by market cap. This is embarrassing for the ""future of finance"" in crypto","PEPE is by far one off the most popular tokens. It was ranked in the top 50 tokens after hitting very nearly a 2 Billion market cap. Even today it still sits in the top 100 after losing over a Billion of market cap. It saw insane price increase of 1000% in a week, even before the Binance listing which again doubled the price. If you ask someone to randomly name a few crypto tokens, PEPE will probably be in that list. There's definitely **very** few in crypto who *haven't* heard of PEPE. Yet, we don't have to dig very deeply to be disappointed.

The pepe website homepage is pretty barebones and poorly done, probably by design, but the worst part is definitely this. 

https://preview.redd.it/eeoo5lnbvz2b1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=676377ef278be921d54f0afcdf90c40cba3e665b

One of the most premier tokens has this as an advertising banner. I saw a document that claimed to be the whitepaper use a lot of material of this homepage in it, but it's unclear if there actually is an official whitepaper at all. Regardless of an official whitepaper or just the official website, this is pretty bad.

Of course the whole roadmap and pitch with Phase 1 MEME etc is pretty poor as well. The about section ironically call out the ridiculousness of modern memecoins(or mostly sh\*tcoins realistically) but also just buys right back into it for self-shilling.

I mean, yeah, we get that it's a memecoin. But Dogecoin never had to go nearly this far. As a matter of fact, Doge looks ridiculously respectful and decent compared to modern memecoins. For this token to be essentially the premier memecoin, as well as one of the most popular tokens across the board says a lot.",456,472,2023-05-30 11:42:42,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS

"TikTok Goes Crazy For Dogecoin, Shiba Inu And Pepe Coin As Memecoin Mania Sweeps Internet",[removed],1,1,2023-05-31 14:28:43,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
Elon Musk is one of us - at least in the money he‚Äôs lost,"As of this week, financial services company Fidelity has reduced the value of its equity stake down to $6.55 billion USD, down from $20 billion last October. They estimated that Twitter is now worth about one third of what Musk paid for it (he bought it for $44 billion in October 2022). This makes Musk about as successful in his Twitter investment as the majority of us here are in our crypto investments, at least in the bear market. 

However, there‚Äôs more to this than meets the eye. Elon is known for his pushing (via Tweets) of meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba, meme NFT projects like Milady that result in pump and dumps and are a notoriously dangerous area to dabble in for regular investors. However, when a few words from your social media can spark a massive pump, it‚Äôs a little easier to make profits in crypto. He‚Äôs undoubtedly made money from the pump and dumps, but it‚Äôs still questionably enough to offset the enormous upfront cost for Twitter. It definitely begs the question of whether one of the world‚Äôs largest microphones was worth the price he paid, and the potential legal implications of using it. Given the SEC and their relentless punishment of celebrities in crypto, it‚Äôs also surprising that up until now Musk has been fairly immune to lawsuits as a crypto shiller, given the publicity of each of his related tweets. **So while Musk may lose percentages on his upfront investments as much as the rest of us, he‚Äôs unfortunately still far different - he controls a lot of the narrative on when coins/NFTs pump, and stands to profit from each.** While we all have some pretty huge risks for dabbling in meme and NFT markets, he can predict some spots to exit his positions based on tweets. Be careful out there buying crypto based on social media based crypto shilling!

Edit to add: I should‚Äôve titled this ‚Äúbut only in there money he‚Äôs lost‚Äù. I hope it‚Äôs clear from this post that I think he‚Äôs a huge manipulator and a problem for our crypto space. Be careful out there with what you invest in!",0,113,2023-05-31 15:41:10,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE
2013 - My first Bitcoin transaction,"Looking back at my very first P2P transaction in 2013, I remembered how nervous I was. 

But it worked surprisingly easy. I just choose one of the many offerings of BTC and went for it. 

Until one day in 2017 friends were discussing the price development and I got curious. I was surprised how much my small investment made, and that there are people willing to buy that small amount of BTC from me, which I paid for so much less!

I was so clueless about the whole market back then. But who would have thought would become of this thing called ""Crypto coins"".

Now, today I just hope someone will buy my 1 PEPE with the same enthusiasm, not because of greed but the hope of a better tomorrow. 

It's Wednesday my dudes!",1,25,2023-05-31 18:27:28,,CryptoCurrency,ANECDOTAL

The hottest project in LSDfi space these days with TVL crossed 100M in just 1 month but it is created by a highly anonymous team with funds from Tornado Cash ?,"**Lybra Finance**, launched last month, uses liquid staking derivatives to offer a decentralized interest-bearing stablecoin.

So far, **Lybra Finance** has:

* hit **100M** in **TVL** in **just over 1 month.**
* recorded the highest inflow of stETH and ETH ($42.57M) on May 29.
* has 100,569 stETH staked ($186.3M) now.

It continues to lead in LSDfi TVL and market share.

However, the development team of Lybra Finance is **completely anonymous** despite the very promising project.

\- Deployer address 0x4c2 was first active on Apr 19 and funded with 1 ETH, which can be ultimately traced back to Tornado Cash via wallet 0x863.

\- This is rather untraceable compared to the dev teams of other ""anonymous coins"" like PEPE  (received first ETH from Bybit) and LADYS (received first ETH from Kucoin).

Reddit is promoting crypto scams,"I was just scrolling through my Reddit homepage and I see an ad *""Claim $500 in Pepe"".* I saw the ad several times after that but here is a screenshot of the ad:

This is an **obvious scam** but I decided to do some digging to prove Reddit is promoting a scam.

They are claiming to give a 90% Sale where:

Discount price: 1 ETH = 6,000,000,000 $pepe ~~(1 ETH = 600,000,000 $pepe)~~.

The latest transaction to the *""Official sale address""* was 2 minutes ago from the time of me writing this and was **0.01199615 ETH ($30.53 CAD).** Perhaps the ad is still attracting the gullible, which is quite unfortunate.

Do you believe that Reddit should be allowed to promote scams? Is it up to users of Reddit to recognize the advertisements are just propaganda. Have any of you seen this particular ad or similar ads on Reddit in the past?

"Be careful. Now, when trading volume has fallen off, is when exchanges can start to fail. Already two have frozen withdrawals, another collapsed and several other lose a huge customer base in the US. And a number of exchanges are showing clear signs of stress like dropping nearly all fees to zero","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0plrhcbuj74b1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=952fec461cdfb6ff09dd1c3d1e0bdcd4bda31d8f

This chart shows Bitcoin trading volume for the past 3 years and the current lows of trading volume are clearly visible. Volume is even lower than during pre-FTX 2022 when exchanges and platforms were freeing withdrawals and falling left and right. It is fairly obvious why this is bad for exchanges as less trading means less fees, that account for the majority of exchange revenue. This tends to put a lot of stress on exchanges and you see it in the promotions offered by them. For instance, FTX ran more than double the amount of trading competition promotions they did in the prior year than they did in the 10 months running up to their collapse in an effort to encouraging trading. Let‚Äôs go through the activities stressed exchanges are doing to encourage trading. As some examples:

* MEXC recently has dropped **both their spot maker and taker fees to 0%**. Futures maker fees are also 0% and futures taker fees are dropped to 0.01%. Now, they only make money off futures takers trades and withdrawal fees. This is in addition to the MANY promotion/trading competition emails they send)

&amp;#x200B;

[MEXC](https://preview.redd.it/dl2jjkl9m74b1.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a33429187f44fe8856506fee1d5748c37d5aae)

* Gate.io **dropped spot trading maker fees and fiat currency trading fees to 0 with 0% maker and taker fees** on BTC-margined futures.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gate.io](https://preview.redd.it/zamcgn3lm74b1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9836d7493a7acf02e7f365697019ea1d301c0c3b)

* Binance have ramped up activity on their launchpad pushing a lot more new projects. They also have quite infamously listed useless tokens of PEPE and FLOKI. It was quite atypical for them to list such a ew (and useless) token in PEPE and you should also question why they only now decided to list FLOKI as well. Bianance is also still running their BTC zero-fee promotion of the TUSD quoted pair.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, things must be pretty extreme for exchange to choose to take ZERO fees for the majority of their products. If people are buying, there'd be no need to drop fees to encourage more trading.

A number of exchanges/platforms have also lost access to US markets as platforms like Binance and Nexo have left Canada, due to new regulations. Bittrex, Nexo and MEXC had already closed doors to US customers, while others in the US face uncertainty. Coinbase is the most prominent, has been forced to stop its lending product as well as many Cefi staking service providers have been forced to stop its lending product and Binance‚Äôs BUSD is a dying coin as their issuer Paxos was ordered to stop minting. All of this obvious take it hit to revenue.

Now the dominoes have already begun to fall.  Hotbit, an exchange that serviced over 1 million people, has shut down very recently and BKEX, one servicing over 8 million, has frozen **all** customer withdrawals for some shady reasons that they claim to be aiding in police investigations. Patricia, another platform that service close to 1 million has also frozen withdrawals. It‚Äôs a *little* weird because there were also allegations of money laundering around two of them, and allegations of a hack involved in another but the reality is that exchanges are **always** dealing with money laundering accusations(because of the anonymity of crypto) and investigations and there are **always** hacks occurring under the radar. But make no mistake that anytime trade volume is low, fees are low, so revenue is low and that‚Äôs prime time for a crash. Just remember that it‚Äôs not your keys.",157,132,2023-06-05 14:32:38,,CryptoCurrency,ADVICE

Every brutal lesson we have learned so far in this Bear Market !,"
Edit : this post got posted in r/buttcoin and I feel like I made it. Yessss. 

TLDR : NOTHING IS SAFE until proven otherwise. 

This bear is exposing a lot of shady people / business and teaching hurtful and precious lessons for regular investors like us many many times. 

Here are my versions of what the bear has taught us so far : 

- Every old saying which are always thought of being true can be Wrong all along all of a sudden. Not your keys , not your coins , Yeah Ledger and Atomic Wallet ? . 

- Apeing into some hotshots tokens during brutal market will always rekt you. (PEPE). 

- Crypto market isn't bullet proof / standalone yet and relies to macro economics quite a lot. 

- Everything can fall no matter how big it is.  (do i really need to list out the fallen crypto businesses ? )

- Treat any crypto businesses as Shady, unethical, and guilty unless they are being proven otherwise. 

- Worshipping an individual instead of looking into their project / business will always rekt you. 

- Influencers and crypto youtubers has no interest for your investment and treat you merely as numbers. 
 
- Nothing is safe, cex , dex, hot wallets , cold wallets , until proven otherwise. 

I guess these are the key takeaways. 

Add yours if you have yours.

Comparing the seven day charts for some of the subs favorites - why are some able to bounce back better than others?,"How have the subs favorite cryptos and BTC fared during this troubling week of RED?

BTC bounced right back up near it's previous levels, still down a bit from seven days ago but nothing to bad considering everything that is happening in the crypto world.

What does it mean if a coin/token is able to bounce right back up after a day filled with bad news?

are the coins/tokens that stayed at the bottom only going to go lower?

Will ALGO and ADA continue to fall?

"The bear market is doing an adequate job cleansing the crypto space of bad projects and actors. Although it is a painful experience now, this cleansing is great for crypto's future","During the bull market, people often proclaimed that the bear market will cleanse the crypto space. Now that we are deep in bear territory, a popular opinion here is that the bear market did not do its job of cleansing this space. For instance, there was a post on this a little over a month ago when shitcoins were popping off

https://preview.redd.it/1vtnvi07715b1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4424647fdedfa4694e01eaa17430bff61808168f

It is true that we have not gotten rid of *all* the shitty projects. However, I would argue that the bear market HAS cleansed this space of a lot of garbage.

# A lot of the bad projects are down a ton

* HEX dropped 99%
* FTT dropped 99%
* Luna dropped 100%
* Algo dropped 96% \[yes, I count this one. It had 500%+ inflation in 2021. Sorry.\]
* Shib dropped 92%
* Doge dropped 93%
* A lot of the NFTs (like pictures of rocks or monkeys) are now $0
* All the other shitcoins that popped off earlier this year are also down a lot. PEPE dropped 79% from the high, for instance.

# A ton of bad actors have been removed from this space

* FTX is gone, taking a lot of bad actors with it, such as SBF and Caroline Ellison
* Do Kwon is gone
* The Celsius ponzi scheme died and with it Alex Mashinsky lost a lot of influence
* The Three Arrows Capital ponzi scheme died
* A lot of small exchanges died that mishandled user funds

&amp;#x200B;

Is there still too much money shinvested in bad projects? Yep.

Was the process of cleansing this space painful? For sure. RIP our portfolios.

Is this good for the space on the long term? If you ask me, absolutely. There were too many bad actors, and a lot of them got flushed out. Now it is time to build and innovate and be patient. The bull always comes back.",235,148,2023-06-09 18:22:38,,CryptoCurrency,PERSPECTIVE

Stalking a Scammer: A Game of Shitrugs,"It's been slightly less than a month since I made a reckless purchase of NUT, an event that led me to the discovery of an entire kingdom of shitcoin scams that is ongoing this very second. Since I busted that fateful NUT, I have found myself contacting exchanges, tracking quite literally thousands of Ethereum wallets, and even filing a report to the US Secret Service, all in an attempt to put an end to this serial scammer who I gave the nickname Shitrugger.

Most, if not all, of my attempts have proven to be a failure. I am waiting for a response from the Secret Service, but I doubt anything will come of it. The exchange Bybit at first gave me hope, as they responded to my email. But after sending tons of transaction hashes, they simply said they couldn't help. I was able to trace deposits and withdrawals from Binance as well, however I feel their hands are full at the moment and have not found the effort to contact them.

I have come to the conclusion that putting a stop to this scam is likely out of my range of abilities. I'm up to about **600 shitcoins** created in 3 weeks I've been able to track.  The number of trading wallets used to create fake trade volume I've found might be close to **10,000**. I've followed Shitrugger from Bybit, through Arbitrum bridges, and to Binance. Stopping this Dynasty of Shit could be done by one of these centralized exchanges, if they have KYC. But me? Me and my NUT? When it comes down to it, I don't even understand *how cryptocurrencies actually work.* If you look in my Google history, you'll find ""wat is a blockchan?"" in my recent searches.

But I have had a hell of a time following all this. I've learned a ton about Ethereum and that has spurred me to learn even more. Despite a likely failure in stopping Shitrugger, I'm still curious about the entire underworld surrounding shitcoin trading. So, I decided to take a gander at the sorts of folks buying Shitrugger's scam coins. My dear Moon farmers, let's see what I find:

This first picture is of the transaction history for GANG, just one of the shitcoins in a long line of shitcoins created by Shitrugger. The highlighted ""multicall"" is one of the functions of Shitrugger - it pretty much blacklists a trader's wallet so they are unable to sell. Here's the evidence of that:

Clicking that transaction and scrolling down until you can ""view more"" gets you to some of the raw data of the transaction. Hitting the ""decode"" button makes things a little clearer:

https://preview.redd.it/d2szy5hrp35b1.jpg?width=784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cf24dc0e1b9bfeb18cfe10e6fbdada08685253b

That there is the address of who made the trade. Lets just see what this particular trader has been up to:

https://preview.redd.it/08sb6c5xp35b1.jpg?width=1793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de873bb26e876bcac095c30f7571d6bdae918d93

Well, well, well. This chap seems to have been very lucky with an early PEPE purchase. Nearly $2.5 MILLION in PEPE, plus a metric fuckton of worthless shitcoins. I scrolled through most of their erc-20 tokens, and a good amount appear to be Shitrugger's product. Let's have a look at their most recent swap:

https://preview.redd.it/em4aicu4q35b1.jpg?width=1694&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8a5c0581783aa11399b7bb63ec905682113764

Following the top transaction from above, I found they had just bought a token called StarDAO. Sounds fishy. So I looked at StarDAO and wouldn't you know it, it had just been created, seeded with a suspiciously familiar amount of ETH. Shortly after, StarDAO rugged. Looks like I found another of Shitrugger's shitcoins, verified by backtracking until I found a link to previous Shitrugger coins using Arkham Intelligence. However, I noticed something odd:

https://preview.redd.it/5y0as1sjq35b1.jpg?width=1132&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78930dad2fd55cfaca9c3c732404a6325555908b

Notice above that there are zero ""multicall"" entries, but instead many ""approve"" entries. Looking into those, it appears they do the EXACT SAME THING - it blacklists the wallet when it attempts to trade. It seems Shitrugger has changed up the code a bit. What I did from here is wait to see if an ""approve"" transaction popped up that had a matching address to the PEPE millionaire. Well, there wasn't one, which means that PEPE Boy never tried to sell StarDAO before it rugged (which isn't surprising, it rugged 1 hour after creation). 

From here, I decided to look at one of the ""approve"" entries in order to see *who* just got blacklisted. I found something else odd:

https://preview.redd.it/lrw9dtbqq35b1.jpg?width=1761&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0731fbe8b6eb3b645918a5f9bf14e201925f9d3

The name of this address is **dimethyltryptamine.eth** and they have $2.7 million in PEPE - oddly close to PEPE Boy. They also have a metric fuckton of Shitrugger's tokens in their wallet, most of the same ones as PEPE Boy.

So what can be learned from all this? I'm still trying to sus it all out, but bottom line: Shitrugger is making a LOT of cash from these shitcoin traders, and shitcoin traders can easily afford to lose that money if just one coin takes off. If PEPE Boy spend $200 on each of the 101 shitcoins in their wallet, the cost basis overall is $20,200, but their profit is $2,395,026 because of that one PEPE swap. And with the similar amounts purchased by the two shitcoin traders, I can assume that there is a system to this shitcoin trading: spend a set amount on EVERYTHING NEW. Which also means that these scam projects will continue. Shitrugger is making a fuckton of money by volume of shitcoins created, shitcoin traders only need to get lucky once.

I'm fascinated by this culture, but it greatly depresses me as well. How much are ETH gas prices impacted by this? How can anyone look at crypto favorably while this takes place? Is there any way to stop this? For those who have followed my previous posts, I've discovered a very simple but large scale shitcoin operation, and I can only image what deeds are funded by this process. 

If anyone has any input/theories, please leave a comment. I'm swimming in a sea of shit here. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for another chapter in this saga. Not sure where I'm going with all this, but my recommendation to all of you is to avoid doing what these degens are doing. The odds of hitting the next PEPE are astronomically small, but the odds of hitting one of Shitrugger's spawn are nigh 99% if you are buying something brand new.

Stay safe out there.",128,63,2023-06-10 02:36:46,,CryptoCurrency,ANALYSIS
"This is a harsh lesson that we are facing still high inflation &amp; recession, a banking/monetary crisis that affects all markets and the difference between a real bull market and a bear market rally we had earlier this year","Earlier this year price shot up by almost 50%. There was a lot of celebrating and pronouncing of a new bull market. Some people call it out saying it was a bear market rally and there was a big difference. Then when prices cooled we had a big sh\*tcoin season when tokens like PEPE came from literally nowhere to gain nearly a 2 billion dollar market cap. Gas fees went ballistic and a lot of money went sloshing into these projects that mostly only made devs rich.

And within all of this, people seemed to forget that we are in the midst of a banking and liquidity crisis. Real estate prices are expected to take a massive dive with prices to fall at least 20% bare minimum. For all the negativity about banks, they are the core of money access and transfers. When they have huge issues like they do now, it is risk and emerging markets like crypto that take the biggest hits first.

And that's all nothing to say of the recession. The economy is only just barely above water because unemployment is still low, but the waves of layoffs keep coming. Europe has already fallen into recession, and who everyone expected to be the saviour as they are the  factory of the world in China have very weak economic figures and are actually lowering interest rates to try to resuscitate their economy. This is not to mention them having their own massive issues of a looming real estate and hence liquidity crisis on top of humongous youth unemployment.

Why and how Pepe got so hyped and popular?,"Why did Pepe and other meme coins experience such significant viral overselling? What factors contributed to their sudden surge in popularity and market demand? Additionally, I'm curious about the cost and intricate process involved in developing a cryptocurrency from inception to its successful launch.

If you were to embark on the journey of creating your own cryptocurrency independently and introducing it to the market, where would you begin? What are the essential steps involved in the development process, such as conceptualization, coding, testing, and marketing? Moreover, considering the resources and efforts required, what would be a reasonable investment range for such an undertaking?

The phenomenon of Pepe and other meme coins gaining widespread attention and being excessively bought and sold has intrigued many observers. It's fascinating to explore the reasons behind their viral success and the dynamics that drove their popularity to unprecedented heights. Similarly, understanding the intricacies of cryptocurrency development, including its technical aspects, financial considerations, and market strategies, can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that await aspiring creators.",1,0,2023-06-16 05:18:57,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION

Pepe is soon to be out of Top 100 !,"

We all know what Pepe is we know how much it has caused average users to get rekt , we won't dwell on it. 

Plus we are seeing a lot of pepe whales selling at losses further pushing the price and sale pressure . 

Here are some stats suggesting that Pepe is soon to be out of Top 100 , good riddance. 

All time high - $0.00000420.   

Current price - 0.00000092. 

Percentage Down  (-78%) (-$ 0.00000328). 

1 Month Change  (-44.91%). 

1 Week Change  (-22.03%). 

 If it has to revist it's all time high it has to made 356.52% Gains which is roughly 3.65X current price. 

The Market cap has bleeded to $380 Million from their infamous $1 Billion in just months. 

I don't think it is a good idea to hold / buy this type of crap.

Why stop DCAing into ALTs?,"Trying to get my head around all the doom and gloom posts regarding ALTs.

Looking back on the last bear market, a lot of the top ALTs really didn't do much. Seems a bit like the dotcom boom in 1999 where you only needed to build a website, regardless of your core business, to get investor funds.

This time around, top ALTs, even the ALTs being attacked by the SEC look to be, for a lack of a better term, doing stuff. Many of the ALTs have continued to build/progress their roadmaps all through the boom and bust. They seem to be more business focused and have actual structure compared to coins that busted previously. They have been gaining partnerships with large non web3 corporates, and basically seem much better run.

So I'm just a bit confused why anyone already investing in one of most risky assets would feel they need to exit completely at a very large loss now compared to other large swings, or even when they ""invested"" in sh!tcoins like safemoon or Pepe.. Guess they believe the tokens wil alll fail? I'm a bit more hopeful for some of these larger ALTs. So will continue to DCA. Would love to hear thoughts on this.",117,341,2023-06-16 07:18:48,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
"Just because the project you believe in supposedly has great fundamentals, it doesn't mean it will perform better than that shitcoin you laugh at people for buying.","Just speaking on this community, there is constantly laughs about how people got suckered into buying shitcoins like Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and that they deserve it... And it's coming from same people that got suckered into buying ''big fundamentals'' projects like Algo, LRC, Nano in their, or close to their all time highs.

 For example the 3 shitcoins I mentioned are down this much from their all time high: 91%, 92%, 79%, where as these 3 projects that were all over this community are down this much from their all time highs: 97%, 95%, 98%.

 And when these crappy animal coins go down we will have popular threads on here laughing at folks: well they got what they deserve. How could they not have seen it.

10 Amazing Tools to Help You on Your Crypto Journey,"A post yesterday asking about a tool to monitor addresses inspired me to come up with a list of some of the best crypto tools to help you navigate on-chain data and DeFi.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. DeFiLlama - The Swiss Army Knife of DeFi

Currently, there is no alternative data analytics platform available in the market that offers the same level of comprehensiveness while still being completely free.

With DeFiLlama, you can access every DeFi vertical (categories, unlocks, stables, volume) across almost every application today. It aims to offer insights into DeFi projects, such as total value locked (TVL), lending and borrowing statistics, trading volume, and more. Users can explore and analyze data from different DeFi platforms to gain a better understanding of the DeFi ecosystem. 

Along with other many useful features, there is also an Airdrop tab that has a list of tokenless projects that could potentially airdrop early adopters. You can sort by TVL and how much money has been raised for the project, which is super helpful.

[ Tokenless protocols that may airdrop](https://preview.redd.it/xuhznj10hl6b1.png?width=2246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2177550df3560c634a0853468f11c1247bf3b935)

# 2. Arkham Intelligence - Deanonoymizing the Blockchain

Arkham Intelligence is an amazing platform that enables users to scrutinize blockchain addresses, inspect both sides of a transaction, track fund movements and investigate counterparty connections.

Unlike its competitors, the platform organizes data by entity and tracks the flow of funds accordingly, deviating from the common practice of sorting things by token.  

From following scammers or tracking whales, Arkham has you covered with innovative features such as..

* Entity Page: Gain an all-encompassing view of the activities carried out by any entity or address.
* Visualizer: Witness the transformation of raw, complex blockchain transactions into easily understandable network maps.
* Dashboards: Curate and share personalized dashboards that capture the essence of these entities and addresses.
* Filtering: Filter and sort transactions across the platform, ensuring you only see what truly matters to you.
* Alerts: Stay ahead of the game by setting up custom alerts for both on-chain and off-chain activities.
* Explorer: Explore specific transaction details with ease and uncover the intricacies of the blockchain.

It currently requires an invite, but it is easy to find one if you search around. Or DM me, I have 7 left.

Very dark days for Crypto. Now is the bottom.,"It feels very lonely down here. No one likes crypto.

There are forces at work that want a piece of the action. The old order, the moneychangers, don't like being left behind. Binance is ousted from every major western area.

This will leave a vacuum. I don't think this space will be left empty. This crisis in crypto is not by accident, but by design. ""ORDER 66"" was declared on crypto on 06/06.

BTC has shown some good support at $25,xx,  and Pepe appears to want to not go lower from here. I would like to see it get above 100 (the short way I write 0.00000100). Currently,  it is at 0.00000094.

If you tuck away some crypto for the next 12 to 24 months, you may be pleasantly surprised. Hopium? Maybe. 

You have to speculate to accumulate.

Feels good, man!",3,11,2023-06-19 06:55:36,,Pepecryptocurrency,

Why?

They are a conduit for quantitative easing. How else they get this big and powerful.

But they will ensure ESG is adopted in this sector. Expect all white papers to be amended shortly with ESG policies. Is your crypto exchange or crypto development team thinking about meeting net Zero? Does it think about diversity and inclusiveness? Does your business think about sustainability? 

They have done all this work on the Wall Street side, but it is no good, if nothing is happening on the crypto space, which is not insignificant and not going away. They have bought a seat at the table now, it's a small one, but they will grow and encroach over time. This is just the beginning.

This is why they are here, I believe. It's not about money. They have unlimited money. It is about power and control. They own stock in every major Listed company, so they have influence at board level.",3,2,2023-06-24 05:07:50,,Pepecryptocurrency,

"What coins would be included in an ""Inverse r/cryptocurrency ETF?"" I'm asking because I think we really need one.","
I've been a part of this subreddit for a few years now and it has become clear to me that we, as a whole, are terrible at predicting successful projects. In years past, we have collectively praised NANO, LTC, VET, ALGO, EOS, BAT, ICX and countless other cryptos. Some of these did well, some did incredibly well for a bit, some did not do well at all.. 
However, some of the coins this sub has spent many posts completely shitting on have done amazingly well. These would include: SOL, PEPE, DOGE, BCH, SHIB, TRX and many others. 

How is it that we are so bad at this? What can we do to change??

I think an imaginary ‚ÄúInverse r/cryptocurrency ETF‚Äù would be a fun experiment to determine whether or not our brains are working against us. If we could put together a collection of the most hated coins in the sub, what would that look like? How would it perform? What do you think should be included in it? 

*Note: Before anyone jumps in to say ‚ÄúwHaT ABouT BTc anD ETh?!?‚Äù or something dumb like that: this post isn‚Äôt about those two. They aren‚Äôt part of this conversation. I think most of us agree that those two are both good, safe investments.*",1,1,2023-06-29 23:30:15,,CryptoCurrency,DISCUSSION
